{"title": "Tricky Hubie | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>H</b>UBERT HUMPHREY'S nation-wide address Monday night showed very clearly that he knows he must break with President Johnson's Vietnam policies to capture the Presidency in November.  It also showed that he is not yet willing to make the break.  The speech was a masterpiece of deceptive political prose, and little more.</span></p> <p><span>Humphrey claimed to be breaking new ground on the Vietnam issue by calling for a reevaluation of American commitments abroad and promising, if elected, to halt the bombing of the North.  But on neither issue did the Vice-President genuinely dissociate himself from the stand of his predecessor.</span></p> <p><span>The construction and delivery of the address were shrewdly designed to play up Humphrey's offer of a bombing halt, and to play down its conditional nature.  But the text speaks for itself:  \"As President, I would stop the bombing of the North as an acceptable risk for peace... In weighing that risk--and before taking any action--I would place key importance on evidence of Communist willingness to restore the demilitarized zone...\"  The purposeful ambiguity of the section of text in which this sentence appears cannot disguise the fact that Humphrey, like Johnson, demands crucial concessions from the North Vietnamese <i>before</i> the U.S. will make concessions of its own.</span></p> <p><span>And while Humphrey spoke of the need to reevaluate U.S. commitments abroad, the opening portion of his speech belies his intention--or ability--to meet that need.  Humphrey justified the policies of the past four years with the frayed phrases of the domino theory.  By its stand, he argued, the U.S. has permitted other sappling nations in Southeast Asia to protect themselves against the communist menace.  In addition, we cannot withdraw unilaterally because such action would open Southeast Asia to \"more violence... more aggression... more instability.\"  If the Vice-President still sees unrest in Southeast Asia simply as the march of aggressive communism, he is a long way from a realistic reappraisal of our foreign policy.</span></p> <p><span>Hubert Humphrey's speech bordered on political deceit, and drastically failed to live up to its promise as a departure on Vietnam policy.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Wayne Morse Fights For Political Life | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>S</b>ENATOR Wayne Morse (D-Ore.) may be involved in the political fight of his career.  Some polls show this most outspoken of Senate doves running as far as twenty-five percentage points behind his Democratic primary opponent Robert Duncan.  Ex-Congressman Duncan came within a small cluster of votes of beating Senator Mark Hatfield in 1966.</span></p> <p><span>No hard and fast rules will determine the outcome of the race.  Oregon has a deep tradition of voter independence from party loyalty.  Large scale patronage and machine politics are as far from its political processes as the Eastern cities spawning such tactics are from this state's easygoing towns.</span></p> <p><span>Both Duncan and Morse are articulate, persuasive campaigners.  Each is hard-working an any activity.  Morse will be 68; Duncan, 48.  Morse's under-dog position is ascribed to a number of factors, especially his position on Vietnam, his efforts to curb certain recent national strikes, his endorsement of Hatfield against Duncan in 1966, and his frank, sometimes blunt statements about a variety of matters.</span></p> <p><span>Morse antagonized the International Machinists Union by working to stop their national strike against the airlines in 1966.  Its leaders have pledged money and workers against Morse this year.  Despite his strongly pro-labor record in the Senate for over twenty years, many other labor leaders say they will back Duncan who is also a labor supporter.</span></p> <p><span>Senator Morse created deep resentment among many Democrats by endorsing Republican dove Mark Hatfield for the Senate in 1966 over Democrat Duncan.  Morse said he wanted a dove elected regardless of party.  Since Hatfield won by less than 2 per cent, a number of Democrats feel Morse deserves no party support in a Democratic primary, and indicate they will work against him.</span></p> <p><span>A number of political commentators discount the polls, saying that Morse will win when the primary is held in May.  They say he has been in the public eye for over 35 years and is very well known across the state.  he is expected to have a well-financed campaign with money coming in from doves all over the country as well as from long standing Oregon supporters.  His opponents will attack this outside influence in an Oregon election.  Duncan, however, will have the same financial difficulties that he had in 1966.</span></p> <p><span><b>M</b>ORSE'S very independence may be an asset in the end.  Many Oregonians say they do not agree with what Morse says, but that they are proud to be represented by such an outspoken individualist.  Such Oregonians see Morse as a maverick Senator representing a maverick state.</span></p> <p><span>Recently Lister Hill, chairman of the Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee, announced his retirement.  If re-elected, Morse will succeed him.  Since that committee handles most education, labor, and poverty programs, Morse will emphasize the importance of his seniority as a source of power for Oregon.  This situation may create the view among some Oregonians that regardless of their feelings toward the men, the state's best interests would be served by retaining the incumbent.</span></p> <p><span>Both men have had dynamic careers in public office.  Morse was the youngest law school dean in the U.S. when he rose to that position at the University of Oregon in 1930.  During the 1930's and World War II he achieved national prominence through his activities in labor negotiation and the War Labor Board.</span></p> <p><span>In 1944 he successfully challenged the incumbent Senator in the <i>Republican</i> primary and won election to the Senate against the Democratic nominee later that year.  In 1950 he won re-election as a Republican, but in 1952 he broke with the Republican party to form a one-man Independent party in the U.S. Senate because of his opposition to the candidacy of Dwight Eisenhower.</span></p> <p><span>In 1954, as an Independent, he stood up for 22 consecutive hours to filibus- ter against the Eisenhower Administration's policy on coastal oil reserves, which Morse considered a great give-away of public resources.  Eisenhower's program was defeated.</span></p> <p><span>The 1954 national elections gave the Senate Democrats, led by Lyndon Johnson, a 48-47 majority.  If Morse had given his one vote to the Republicans, a tie would have resulted and Republican Vice President Richard M. Nixon would have been able to cast the deciding vote in favor of Republican control of all Senate committees.  Morse, however, cast his vote for Democratic control and thus made it possible for Lyndon Johnson to become majority leader.</span></p> <p><span>In 1956 and 1962 Morse ran as a Democrat.  He was the only man in American history who had successfully run for the Senate as both a Democrat and Republican.</span></p> <p><span><b>D</b>UNCAN is an outstanding trial attorney.  As a state legislator he was the first man in history voted Speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives for two consecutive legislative sessions.  He served in Congress from 1962 to 1966 where he had a strong liberal voting record on domestic issues.  He was among a handful of Representatives voting against the House Un-American Activities Committee.  He spurned sure re-election to run against Mark Hatfield, the popular Republican Governor, for the U.S. Senate.</span></p> <p><span>Before the general election in 1966 Hatfield had clearly stated a dove position on Vietnam.  Duncan was convinced that Hatfield's stand on Vietnam had disturbed enough voters so that a hawkish Democart could possibly defeat this seemingly unbeatable Governor.  Hatfield retreated to a more ambiguous stand.  This, plus Morse's endorsement, may have pulled out his narrow victory.</span></p> <p><span>The bitterness of the Democratic primary may cause the losing faction to stay home on election day in November or to vote Republican.  The primary winner might find himself the final loser.</span></p> <p><span>The Republicans, however, are not in any solid array either.  There is a split between hawks and doves just as on the Democratic side.  Senator Hatfield has indicated that he prefers a dove as the Republican nominee, but he has not found any promising dove candidate yet.</span></p> <p><span>The popular incumbent Republican Governor Tom McCall, an ex-TV newscaster, was a possibility.  U.S. Senate Republicans offered him $50,000 in campaign funds.  He has a proven ability to draw Democratic voters in a state where they outnumber Republicans 500,000 to 400,000, and would have been a heavy favorite over either if the Democrats came out of the primary bitterly divided.  Fortunately for the Democrats, he has said he will keep to his 1966 campaign promise to serve a full, four-year term as Governor.</span></p> <p><span>Most Republicans want to avoid a primary election fight within their own ranks.  They may focus on Robert Packwood, a talented 35-year-old legislator who has quietly cultivated support among progressive Republicans over the last few years.  He is considered a liberal but his views on Vietnam are ambiguous.  Packwood says the United States has a legal and moral right to be in Vietnam, but condemns the Administration for not developing a long-range plan for leaving.  Since he is little known and has not run a state-wide campaign before, he must hope for deep division among the Democrats as the foundation of victory.</span></p> <p><span>Thus, Oregon may find that, as in the ancient fable, the young lad has run off with the bacon while the two giants pummel each other for possession</span></p>"}

Your government has known for several months that the Communists planned a massive spring offensive aimed not only at Saigon, but at all of Vietnam.</span></p> <p><span>\"The stated purposes of the Communist uprisings have failed.  Communist leaders counted on widespread support among the populace for their effort.  Populace or support--they found little or none.</span></p> <p><span>\"The loss of a national capital should not prove disheartening to the Saigon government.  We Americans can point with pride to our own history, to 1814, when the British captured and burned this very city of Washington from which I am speaking to you tonight.  Tonight the United States stands great, while the British are known mostly for funny movies and a bum pound.</span></p> <p><span>\"We can point with pride to World War II, when the great capital city of Paris, France, fell to the Nazis of Germany.  But I ask you--who won the war?  Certainly not the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span>\"And finally we can point with pride to Korea, which, like Vietnam, is in Asia.  Communists captured the capital of the unfortunate Koreans in 1950 but, of course, we Americans were only marking time.  And tonight's latest diplomatic cables show that the capital of South Korea remains free of Communist control.</span></p> <p><span>\"In Vietnam, the United States still retains its strong position in the provincial capitals of Mau Can, Can Tho and Tho Whut.

There have been enough of these incidents.'</span></p> <p><span>\"We want the world to know we stand foursquare behind our Secretary of State in this matter.  But there are no easy solutions, and therefore we do not think Sen.  Wallace Bennett's advice to 'send an armored division roaring into Saigon, throw a tow rope around Ambassador Bunker and Mrs. Percy, and haul them out of there' is particularly helpful.</span></p> <p><span>\"We also think the American voters will have the good sense to recognize Mr. Nixon's description of the loss of Saigon as a 'tactical blunder' as so much election year blarney.</span></p> <p><span>\"We are also happy to report that General Westmoreland has escaped Saigon safely to a windowless command center on Formosa where, incidentally, Chiang Kai-shek has offered 33,000 Nationalist Chinese troops for use in Vietnam.</span></p> <p><span>\"We dont want to prophesy on what is going to happen in Vietnam or why.  We feel reasonably sure of our strength.  We will continue to fight until there is some better sign than these last weeks have provided of Hanoi's willingness to concede defeat.</span></p> <p><span>\"We are of course taking such precautionary steps as we may think the military situation calls for.  We have ordered the aircraft carrier <i>Enterprise</i> to the South China Sea.</span></p> <p><span>\"I see no reason to increase American force levels in Vietnam beyond the 525,000 men now scheduled to serve there.

{"title": "McCarthy Schism | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>P</b>OLITICIANS and intellectuals have always been the uneasiest of bedfellows.  Members of the academic community constantly complain that too little attention is paid to their insights on policy matters; party stalwarts respond to academic criticism by observing that John Kenneth Galbraith gets out very few votes in East Boston on election day.</span></p> <p><span>In 1968 the schism between these two groups is wider than ever.  The liberal intellectual coalition with labor is breathing only with difficulty.  The Vietnam war has choked off what few channels of communication existed between the academic community and the Democratic Administration.</span></p> <p><span>Ironically this lack of accord is felt very deeply in the McCarthy campaign, where one might least expect to find it.  For McCarthy is nothing if not an intellectual, and he is certainly not a very political politician.</span></p> <p><span>Yet from the beginning his campaign has been subjected to attacks from the academic community.  \"He is not fiery enough,\" people keep saying; why doesn't he pound his fist on the table once in a while.  Some intellectuals have even gone so far as to suggest that time would be better spent working for the election of Nelson Rockefeller.  (Rockefeller, despite the silence he has maintained on Vietnam during his coy search for the Republican nomination over the past year, has a hawkish record which rivals that of Richard Nixon.)</span></p> <p><span>\"For years these guys have been complaining about politicians who are all style and no content,\" one McCarthy aide grumbled last week.  \"Now at last they have a candidate who is real, who talks to the issues, and they run the other way.\"</span></p> <p><span>When this assessment was presented to Senator McCarthy he nodded agreement.  \"That's the way they talk down at the Harvard Club.\"  He looked up at the CRIMSON reporter, smiled slightly and added, \"or at M.I.T.\"  \"It's almost as if they wanted me to be a demagogue.\" he continued, \"after they've been trying to get away from demagoguery all these years.\"</span></p> <p><span>Observers of McCarthy's Minnesota campaigns say that his timing in those contests--he has won seven out of seven, including two against favored Republican incumbents--has been perfect.  Indeed the increased pace and tougher sound of McCarthy's campaign over the past three weeks in New Hampshire has left many reporters wondering if he just might do well in the Granite State after all.</span></p> <p><span>McCarthy himself is a vocal proponent of this line of thought.  \"Nothing looks deader than the New England sugar maple in early February,\" he notes whimsically.  \"But in March the sap starts to rise and the tree surprises everyone by coming to life.\"</span></p> <p><span>Much of the vituperation expended on McCarthy's campaign style by intellectuals is unjustified.  The Senator's response to Senator MacIntyre's charge that he had not spelled out his programs--\"I'm beginning to think the Senator either can't read or doesn't hear very well\"--might equally be applied to the liberal intellectuals.</span></p> <p><span>The Senator should not, however completely ignore this criticism.  His campaign does not need to become more radical or even more fiery.  But he could be more specific.  He could begin to respond to policy moves by President Johnson quickly and with toughness.  Johnson provides McCarthy with plenty of mistakes to capitalize on; the Senator has the wit and intelligence to bring the full implications of these mistakes home to regular Democratic voters.</span></p>"}
{"title": "'Wallace:  LBJ's Man' | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>\"I</b>F I were President Johnson and I wanted to be re-elected,\" Barry Goldwater has said, \"I would put George Wallace on my payroll.\"  Other Republicans, alarmed by polls that consistently show Wallace drawing twice as many votes away from a Republican ticket as from the President, share Goldwater's suspicion that the White House has been giving Wallace at least tacit support for his third-party movement.</span></p> <p><span>Wallace's candidacy pleases Democratic strategists because it will cripple the Republican nominee in the South, where most voters are bitterly opposed to the Administration.  Wallace can deny Southern electoral votes to Republicans by carrying the states himself or by splitting the anti-Johnson vote so that the President can win a plurality in the state.</span></p> <p><span>In an effort to counter Wallace's appeal, Republican leaders in the South have unleashed a two-sided attack on him.  They have tried to show that voting for Wallace will allow Johnson to carry the state, but conservatives concerned about their principles will refuse to back any Republican who seems as liberal as they think Johnson is.  Even Richard Nixon, who campaigned extensively in the South in 1960, runs behind the President and Wallace in a three-way poll.</span></p> <p><span>Party spokesmen have also tried to neutralize Wallace's appeal by attacking his record of \"socialist welfare measures\" in Alabama.  When Wallace told an audience that he considers himself \"a populist,\" the Republican state chairman in Georgia said that just means he is \"a socialistic racist.\"</span></p> <p><span>Voters have not been impressed by these attempts to prove that Wallace is not a true conservative.  They know that he has taken the acceptable position on states' rights, foreign policy, and crime in the streets.  More important than these issues, however, is the South's overwhelming bitterness toward the federal guidelines for school desegregation.  And everyone knows what Wallace thinks about that.</span></p> <p><span><b>N</b>ELSON Rockefeller has said several times that the Wallace threat in the South confirms his belief that a conservative Republican cannot be elected in November.  Disturbed by Rockefeller's comments, Richard Nixon started telling interviewers that he was not concerned about the South because \"I'm not conceding any of these states to Wallace.\"  As a matter of fact, Nixon says, \"Wallace will so disrupt the already shattered Democratic machines in the great cities that it will be easier for the Republicans to come through in the big states.\"</span></p> <p><span>Wallace agrees.  Jumping at the chance to hurt Democrats in the North, Wallace has attempted in the last year to convince Northerners that he is not just a crude racist--\"My wife received 40 per cent of the nigger vote.  These niggers know I want them to get educated.\"  Instead of blatant racism, Wallace offers Northerners \"sound Constitutional principles\" because \"I'm not running on segregation, I'm running on states' rights.\"  That distinction makes him seem more respectable, so Northern whites find it easier to support him openly.</span></p> <p><span>Wallace has also increased his respectability by his frequent appearances at luncheons for business and professional men.  His speeches are usually interrupted by table-thumping applause, and his attacks on the \"bearded intellectual morons\" who commit treason when they denounce the war in Vietnam often bring the cheering community leaders to their feet.</span></p> <p><span>His success in several Democratic primaries in 1964 proves that blue-collar workers will vote for him.  Naturally, explosive riots this summer would reinforce racial antagonisms and create instant converts to the Wallace banner.  But he also received substantial support from Republican suburbs in his 1964 primary races, and Nixon's calculations ignore the possibility that middle-class suburbanites might desert the Republican nominee for Wallace almost as readily as blue-collar workers dump Johnson.</span></p> <p><span><b>E</b>VEN if the Republicans hold the suburbs, they will find it difficult to benefit from Wallace's strength outside the South.  Polls show that his support is insignificant in the East and is only slightly important in the Middle and Far West.  Since hostility to the Administration is widespread among farmers, Republicans would do well in the Mid-west even if Wallace did not siphon off Democratic votes.</span></p> <p><span>With Johnson taking the South and California, the Republican candidate would be left fighting for the populous Northern states which normally give their large blocs of electoral votes to the Democratic ticket.  Nixon would be even less popular in these states than the President is.  A liberal Republican like Rockefeller, as the polls have indicated since last spring, would be a much stronger candidate.  He might even carry one or two moderate states in the South if he could win the solid Negro support Johnson expects to get.</span></p> <p><span>Wallace's hopes of obtaining enough electoral votes to blackmail a major candidate into a \"coalition government\" will probably prove fruitless.  If Nixon is the Republican nominee, Wallace's candidacy is most likely to result in Johnson's re-election.  His racist campaign in the fall will only heighten tensions already intensified by a summer of unprecedented violence in the cities.</span></p> <p><span>But Wallace is satisfied with his \"spoiler\" role this year.  He thinks his campaign will have enough impact on the nation to enable him to mount a formidable challenge to the major parties in 1972.  Dreaming about a confrontation with Sen. Robert F. Kennedy in four years, Wallace likes to watch the countryside pass beneath his plane as he flies off on his campaign tours--\"Just think, someday I'll be President of all that.\"</span></p>"}

{"title": "An Interview with Dr. Spock | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><i>(Following his sentencing Wednesday morning Dr. Benjamin Spock held a news conference and then gave David L. Horn the following interview.</i>)</span></p> <p><span>DR. SPOCK:  \"I want people to realize that of the two leading contenders for the presidency, Richard Nixon believes the war should be bloodier and faster.  The leading Democratic contender is Hubert Humphrey, who has said nothing about the War.  In fact he [Nixon] has been more in favor of the War than has Lyndon Johnson.  I say, what an impasse for the United States to be in at this time.  I say to the American People--Wake up, get out there and do something before it is too late, before we have another president committed to killing American men at the rate of a thousand or two thousand a mouth.  This could go on for years.</span></p> <p><span>The peace conference being held in Paris is a fraud.  The president is pretending to move toward peace.  The president has done nothing but shifted his slippery ground.  We have made no progress except the withdrawl of Lyndon Johnson.  Instead we have Richard Nixon and Hubert Humphrey.  There is no solution in sight.  The War could be stopped if one hundred million Americans stood and said:  let's stop it.  More than half the American people think it is a mistake, but they don't have the initiative or energy to stand up and do something.  Let's do something before it is too late.\"</span></p> <p><span>QUESTION:  The government has charged you with conspiracy...</span></p> <p><span>DR. SPOCK:  \"I deny that I was part of a conspiracy; I deny that I ever counseled anyone [to avoid the draft]; I feel that all the things that I have done are covered by the Free Speech guarantee of the First Amendment.\"</span></p> <p><span>QUESTION:  What do you think were the principal issues in your trial?</span></p> <p><span>DR. SPOCK:  \"The reason that all of us (Spock and the four other co-defendants) were indirectly involved in this is because we believe <b>this war is totally illegal.</b>  Before the trial starts, the judge says--this is not the issue.  In my appeal the issue of the illegality of the war will be raised.</span></p> <p><span>QUESTION:  At the news conference, you stated to N.B.C. News that the Paris Peace Conference was a fraud.</span></p> <p><span>DR. SPOCK:  \"I think he [Johnson] is a man who has to save face.  I don't mean that he is deliberately keeping us in the war.  My gratuitous analysis is that without him knowing it, he has to save face.  He is reported to have said, just before the escalation in 1965, that when his military and State Department people told him that the Saigon government and army were about to collapse--his reply was, that I refuse to be the first President to lose a war.  This seems the only plausble reason why a man who campaigned as a peace candidate would turn around and become a war escalator.</span></p> <p><span>\"Secondly, Johnson completely misjudged, miscalculated the Vietnamese.  He thought that if the strongest country, militarily and industrially, decided that something was right for Vietnam, then the other side would capitulate.  Johnson is a man of action and feels that if you <b>know</b> that you have the strength, show your strength resolutely, and the other side will cave in.  The other side hasn't caved in.  To Johnson I am sure that it is inconceivable that this tiny country is beating us.</span></p> <p><span>\"Johnson's formula for not running is extremely shrewd:  to pretend to the American people and to himself that because of a dangerous division in the country he is withdrawing to prevent that division from going further.  I think that this is what the man consciously believes.  I think this is an ingenious cover for his inability to admit that he has made a disastrous mistake.</span></p> <p><span>QUESTION:  But why is the Paris Peace Conference being staged?</span></p> <p><span>DR. SPOCK:  \"Johnson is still hoping to win, at the negotiating table, what he has been unable to win on the battle-field.  From what I have seen, I don't think Johnson is prepared to offer anything to the Vietnamese.  And while we wait, 1000 or 2000 Americans are dying every month in Vietnam.  The conference is a very ingenious way to take the pressure off himself [Johnson] and Vice-President Humphrey, and it takes some of the wind out of McCarthy's sails.</span></p> <p><span>\"The only hope for America and the world is in the new idealism and the new realism of the young people of America and Europe; the only hope is that youth think that it is worth doing something for humanity:  if it were not for that, I would withdraw from the human race or at least from civilization</span></p>"}
{"title": "Making of the President '68 | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>At 8:30 on September 29th, 1968, the previous show, the third in a series of new, educational specials called \"The History of Drama:  From Tragedy to Farce,\" faded and disappeared from the television screen.  After several seconds of advertising, the picture dissolved to the three men who were part of America's second great presidential TV debate, Hubert Humphrey, Richard Nixon and Howard K. Smith, the moderator.  This was true American drama:  the two nominees in the presidential contest representing the two major parties debating live before the entire nation the vital foreign and domestic issues affecting the country.</span></p> <p><span>The planning for this program had begun many months before.  In early July of the election year Nixon had suggested that he debate with Humphrey, or as he said then, \"the Democratic nominee,\" and after the post-convention electioneering got under way the debates were arranged by a Nixon aide, who proposed that the debates be held in the homes of each of the nominees with the whole family of each candidate participating.  The arrangement quickly fell through, however, when Nixon arranged for a rush marriage of his daughter to the Eisenhower boy and then declared Ike \"an intimate member of his family.\"</span></p> <p><span>Humphrey, who had already come under pressure from his staff to get assurances from Nixon that he would not put his dog on camera, had plans for the debates to be held at different historic parks around the country, but eventually both sides agreed to stick to the same format as the historic Kennedy-Nixon debates of 1960.</span></p> <p><span>The debates began with an eight-minute statement by each candidate which turned out to be only seven minutes on air-time because Howard K. Smith who timed the statements had obtained his stop watch through a small shopkeeper who, it turned out, was a vigorous supporter of George Wallace and because his man had been shut out of the debates decided to take his revenge by setting the clock fast.  Therefore the first two statements were abruptly cut off at seven minutes although they had been planned for eight.  The error was discovered but the harm had been done.  Especially for Richard Nixon.</span></p> <p><span>Nixon was the first to speak.  He had decided at a strategy meeting earlier in the day to initially speak of his qualifications for the office of the Presidency; he wanted to show that he was a versatile and experienced man, he wanted to show the nation a fresh Nixon.  So his initial speech was taken up with an explanation of how he had been on the Johnny Carson show and had spoken of his childhood desire to be a concert pianist at which point Mr. Carson suggested that he play the piano for the people now, an offer which was taken up, and then how he felt a thrill of excitement as he played and then more of a thrill as the people in the audience applauded him louder than he had ever heard before.  Unfortunately, Mr. Nixon was suddenly cut off and did not have time to draw from this incident the conclusion that it proved his qualifications for the highest, most responsible office in the United States.</span></p> <p><span>Mr. Humphrey, recognizing himself to be at a distinct advantage at this point made a decision to abandon his prepared statement.  Speaking of himself in the third person, as is his wont, he described Hubert Humphrey in highly animated terms as the son of a small-town druggist who had graduated from high school first in his class.</span></p> <p><span>Evaluations of the debate followed endlessly.  What were the issues in the debates, and how far did these affect the final decision of American voters about their choices in November?  Dr. George Gallup, in his comprehensive and scholarly poll found that most Americans were evenly divided as to who they thought won the debates.  He also found that the main issue on which Americans thought they could and should make their decision in view of the debates, was essentially which candidate had a more typical upbringing for an American boy to admire and which man used more \"homey\" language, filled with folksy metaphors and phrases.  It was only in the debates that this factor was brought out, when both Nixon and Humphrey were speaking directly to the nation, and when they chose to talk at length about boyhood and their personal lives.</span></p> <p><span>Dr. Gallup made lengthy conclusions about this striking phenomenon.  He first recognized that Americans would often be listening directly to the president, as they had in the debates, and that because of this fact the debates had been helpful in allowing all Americans to choose the man they wanted to have to listen to for the next four years, maybe eight.</span></p> <p><span>When in November Richard Nixon fell to defeat for what must have seemed to him an unbearable last time, he broke out crying to the press the reason for his loss.  He did not cite Humphrey's brilliant \"folksiness\" on the debates.  Instead he quoted from a scholarly work by a Harvard professor which documented in 700 pages America's unkind feelings towards musicians (long-haired, sexual deviates...) and announced that he was entering a career as a concert pianist.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Politics '68 | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Except for the primary results and assassinations which have confounded this Presidential year, perhaps the most stunning aspect of the campaign so far has been the astonishing frenzy of crowds across the nation for many of the candidates.  Nothing like it has been seen in years.</span></p> <p><span>Robert Kennedy nearly got his clothes torn off in Indiana and California.  Middle-aged matrons in the Mountain States and suburbs of the South swoon whenever Ronald Reagan mounts the platform.  George Wallace's appearance at the sikeningly plush Sheraton Boston Hotel resembled an old-style political revival.  Nelson Rockefeller pulled thousands of Wall St. bankers and their secretaries from the ticker tapes to an hour-long rally in tropical heat.  And even cool Eugene McCarthy has had to start kissing babies.</span></p> <p><span>Amidst all this, both parties are rushing ass-backwards toward the nominations of the two dullest candidates in the field--Richard Nixon and Hubert Humphrey.  Party leaders on both sides, as reports from the governors' conference in Cincinnati suggest, view this prospect with something less than riotous enthusiasm.  They seem to think that the screaming, grabbing, tugging, and titers may be more than discontent over rising crime rates and Vietnam.</span></p> <p><span>In fact, the top issue of the campaign may not be any kind of vague diplomatic or legislative program--although the candidates try hard to differentiate themselves here--but what a Dedham real estate man terms \"strong, trustworthy leadership.\"  Voters, as a whole, seem less outraged by Mayor Lindsay's anguished call that \"we've gotten off the track\" than by drift in Vietnam, dabbling with inflation, and shilly-shallying on riots.  Lyndon Johnson's oft-affirmed practice of seeking a high middle ground has gotten him--and men like Nixon and Humphrey--in more hot water than the grinding poverty and casualty rates which produce the most extreme forms of protest.</span></p> <p><span>This is not to say that the nation necessarily wants a Boulanger in charge.  What the campaign so far does suggest, however, is that most voters are confused by the war, unsure about what to do about urban blight, and dismayed by charges of pervasive racism.  They want more than a welter of new commitments, more than a mind-boggling array of plans to finance urban redevelopment.  Rather, they want precisely what Lyndon Johnson has not given them--a kind of rhetorical coherence, a feeling that if the problems are tough, at last someone has a decent idea of how to start dealing with them.  Americans--students and black militants aside--are too smart to demand immediate solutions.  They merely want something said and done that holds promise and makes sense.</span></p> <p><span>The trouble with Nixon and Humphrey is that they may be forever tarred by their identification with policies and decades blamed for the current mess.  They are suffering form a rather logical--if unfair--guilt by association.  But the apparent demand for newness and coherence, reflected in the apathy toward the front-runners and frenzy over the dark-horses, may be an intolerable burden for any of the candidates.  That is because the issues which are the guts of the national discontent are simply not susceptible--in any serious sense--to the kind of simplistic critical discussion going on today.</span></p> <p><span>For example, take the candidate's attitude towards urban problems.  McCarthy bickered for weeks with many of his backers, over whether to state that domestic turmoil was, in terms of national priority, more important than foreign policy.  What this actually means for a prospective McCarthy Presidency is unclear.  For McCarthy will have to carry on the normal tricky business of diplomacy with allies and enemies alike.  Anyway, a statement merely setting a vague priority is meaningless.  If, instated McCarthy is thinking of reappraising the value of our alliances or military aid programs, that is something else--a genuine occasion for a full-blown national debate.  But a brief rhetorical sop to alienated liberals and blacks is a guide to nothing.</span></p> <p><span>McCarthy is not the only one guilty of recognizing problems, but failing to grapple with them publicly.  Nixon, Rockefeller, and Humphrey have wasted a lot of energy talking about the virtues of private enterprise and various schemes to route private financial investment into ghetto development.  Thinking liberals and blacks, so long starved for any attention from national politicians, are, naturally, greatly encouraged.</span></p> <p><span>Sadly, their encouragement is such that they refuse to ask hard questions--like what happens if public bonds for ghetto investment achieve only modest success in money markets.  They have also refused to grapple with the obvious pitfalls of turning over power and authority normally residing in Washington to the state capitals.  De-centralization is a good vote-getting phrase.  Once operative, though, it may make a bigger mess than the one in Washington.</span></p> <p><span>Public education, of course, is a tough business.  Most politicians pay lip service to the theory, and prefer to let congressional committees and blue-ribbon panels do the spadework in comparative privacy.  Perhaps it is too early to ask for anything else.  But the feeling persists that we are witnessing a phony debate in a time when the voters are more eager than ever for genuine open contention and debate.</span></p> <p><span>Simply put, the byzantine machinations of government a la Johnson have stirred the nation form its customary political apathy.  That is why the cords are so large, noisy, and unruly.  What the politicians have forgotten, though, is that the crowds signify more than chaos, more than a desire for a good time.  They reflect a deep popular desire to see the issues discussed with an almost un-American clarity and candor.  And that is why the next President, whoever he is, may find to his dismay that new politics means not only greater public participation, but an increasingly demanding and critical public intelligence.</span></p> <p><span>Wallace, Reagan, Rockefeller, and McCarthy are not necessarily new politicians.  But voters seem to think that, unlike Nixon and Humphrey, they aren't old-style con men.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Vice-President Choice Almost Splits GOP | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>MIAMI BEACH, Aug. 8--The Republican National Convention which last night nominated Richard M. Nixon because he was the man who could unify the party, almost split wide open tonight in a floor fight against Nixon's choice for Vice-President, Gov. Spiro T. Agnew of Maryland.</span></p> <p><span>The name of Gov. George Romney of Michigan was placed into nomination by the chairman of the Nevada delegation, amid great cheering from an audience which was noticeably unenthusiastic about Agnew.  There was also a move underway to nominate Mayor John V. Lindsay of New York, but the Mayor himself reportedly squelched it.  Lindsay, in fact, delivered a seconding speech for Agnew.</span></p> <p><span>While the futile floor fight was waged on national television, blacks fought with Miami police in Liberty City, a Miami slum about six miles away from Miami Beach.  Police reported rampant looting.  Republican Governor Claude Kirk called in the National Guard and appeared on television at 7 p.m. asking people in the area to spend a quiet night with their families.  By midnight, four Blacks were dead and over 75 people were arrested.</span></p> <p><span>In the vice-presidential balloting at Convention Hall, Romney drew 186 votes and 26 other delegates declined to vote for Agnew.  Nominating conventions generally accept by unanimous acclamation the choice made by the party's presidential candidate.  The small number of votes Romney received was not indicative of the Convention's apparent dissatisfaction with Agnew:  the 92-vote New York delegation, for example, voted 84-8 for Agnew because the delegation leaders had been told shortly before in a telephone conversation with Gov.  Nelson Rockefeller that Rockefeller felt they should stick with Nixon's choice.  Among the eight who decided to vote for Romney anyway was Sen. Jacob K. Javitz.  The Massachusetts delegation voted 26 for Agnew, 8 for Romney.</span></p> <p><span>After the balloting.  Gov. Romney stood up at his delegation's microphone and asked the Convention to approve Agnew by unanimous acclamation, which it did.</span></p> <p><span>Earlier in the day, Nixon had surprised everyone and irritated many by announcing that Agnew was his choice.  The Maryland governor had not been mentioned as a contender by any of the news media.  The New York <b>Times</b> this morning devoted the second deck of an eight-column headline to the improving chances of Lindsay.  Others considered likely by those who didn't know were Sen.  Mark Hatfield (Ore.) and Sen.  Charles Percy (III.).</span></p> <p><span>Agnew, who was elected Governor in 1966, has said often that he basically agrees with President Johnson's Vietnam policy.  In his acceptance speech last night, he said \"Anarchy ,rioting, or even civil disobedience has no constructive purpose in a constitutional republic.\"  In the prepared text, \"civil disobedience\" was preceded by two words which the governor failed to deliver:  \"currently stylish.\"</span></p> <p><span>No one knows for sure why Agnew is Nixon's choice.  It was clearly not for anything he will add to the campaign--he is an unknown, and not a dynamic speaker.  Agnew did help Nixon's chances for the nomination by giving up his favorite son status and supporting Nixon, but it is not likely that any deal was involved.</span></p> <p><span>Nixon's problem--the one place he did make something of a deal--was that in order to hold Southern votes in line last night against Reagan inroads, he had apparently promised a lot of delegates he would not choose a vice-presidential candidate objectionable to any part of the country.  Lindsay and Hatfield were objectionable to the South.  Among those acceptable to the South.  Agnew had done the most for the Nixon cause.</span></p> <p><span>In Nixon's acceptance speech--a speech which he worked on all last week on Long Island--the GOP's standard-bearer repeatedly attacked the Johnson Administration for its war abroad and its lawlessness at home.</span></p> <p><span>Nixon indirectly attacked the Supreme Court.  \"Let us recognize,\" he said, \"that some of our courts in their decisions have gone too far in weakening the peace forces as against the criminal forces and we must act to restore that balance.\"</span></p> <p><span>He drew his biggest standing ovation of the evening when he said, \"When respect for the United States has fallen so low that a fourth-rate military power like North Korea will hijack a United States vessel on the high seas, it is time for new leadership to restore respect for the United States of America.</span></p>"}

I found myself thrust into a boisterous demonstration of young and old Rockefeller supporters, armed with brassy instruments, who had come to the airport to greet the Massachusetts delegation.  They screamed and played so loud that no one could hear the public address announcements about departures and arrivals.</span></p> <p><span>But when you've seen one of Rockefeller's support demonstrations, you've seen them all.  And when you've seen one Miami Beach hotel, you've seen them all.  And when you've seen one GOP elephant, and one airline-stewardess-turned-Nixon-hostess, one real-life U. S. Senator close up, and one television camera you've seen--if not all--all that you care to see.</span></p> <p><span>By Monday afternoon, with the convention officially only a few hours old, almost everyone seemed subconsciously to have realized that there wasn't enough of substance to do to fill the time, and the rest of the week was devoted to justifying one's presence.</span></p> <p><span>The news media people justify their presence by creating the maximum amount of drama out of a situation which would be rather undramatic without their help.  Every day they poll the delegates and report the fluctuations--a few votes up for one candidate here, a few down for another there, will Nixon win on the first ballot?</span></p> <p><span>What do all these polls mean anyway, when CBS, AP and UPI can come up with different answers?  After all, there is no sampling error--they are polling all 1333 delegates.  And why the small shifts every day?  It is because one day, a poor defenseless woman delegate is cornered by three aggressive Nixon aides and practically battered into switching her allegiance.  By the next day, Rockefeller would have heard about this, and his men would go and batter her back.  In between, she may tell AP she favors Nixon, UPI she favors Rockefeller, and CBS she's uncommitted.</span></p> <p><span><b>The Elks</b></span></p> <p><span>The delegates, meanwhile, justify their presence by talking to each other a good deal.  This is not unlike what they would do at the local Elks or Rotary Club meeting, but here it is considered more important because they are all uncommitted or will be when their delegation is released from certain obligations, and they have the power to choose the next President of the United States (at political conventions, the candidate for such-and-such job is always referred to as so-and-so, the next such-and-such).</span></p> <p><span>But despite the talk, it is a mistake to believe there is really much delegate interaction at this convention.  Delegates talk primarily to other delegates they knew before they came, almost exclusively to delegates from their own state.  The delegations are so spread apart in the various hotels along Miami Beach's Collins Ave, that it is almost impossible to see people from other delegations unless you are a candidate for President in which case you make a special effort.</span></p> <p><span>Now what does a delegate talk about to other members of his own delegation?  In general, they already agree on the issues, so they talk about when their obstreperous governor will release the delegation from its commitment to him as a favorite son.  They may disagree on which candidate to support (this is relatively independent of positions on the issues), but they will probably conclude by saying any candidate will do in the end, and the GOP is going to win this year.</span></p> <p><span>What you do not see is delegates from the North talking to delegates from the South, or black delegates talking to Southern segregationists, except perhaps on the most superficial social level.  There is simply no institutionalized opportunity for interstate dialogue.</span></p> <p><span><b>On the Beach</b></span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile, I see delegates on the beach (there is plenty of time for me to be one the beach) saying to each other, \"I guess I ought to go to so-and-so's rally.  I haven't really done much since I've been here.\"</span></p> <p><span>The people who make up the program for the Republican National Convention have trouble filling the time too.  For both sessions on Monday and the one Tuesday night, they had to find a glittering cast of speakers who would bring honor to the Republican party without touching at all on the question of who should be nominated.  To be sure, Barry Goldwater, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and Mayor John V. Lindsay in their own ways indirectly supported their choices for the top spot on the ticket through what they said, but for the most part those first two days were uncontroversial, and insufferably boring.  The television networks do well to cut into and out of speeches in a kind of on-the-spot editing (based on advanced copies of the text).  Sitting in the Convention building, all I could do was walk out of the hall and hide in the room where reporters can get free roast beef sandwiches.</span></p> <p><span>Most experienced reporters do not even attend the Convention sessions until the voting Wednesday night.  There is little to be gained by attending anyway.  I overhead one newspaperman saying to his editor Tuesday evening, \"We ought to get a Sony portable television for the voting tomorrow night, because we can't see anything from our seats.\"  To the extent that the Convention takes place in the Convention hall, television is bigger and better than the real thing.  This disturbs me somewhat, because I didn't have to fly to Miami to watch television.</span></p> <p><span><b>A Still-Born Baby</b></span></p> <p><span>Television, of course, suffers from the self-justification syndrome worse than any other group.  While reporters have to fill a few pages a day with Convention material (which varies remarkably little from one newspaper to another), the network people--especially CBS and NBC--have committed themselves to feeding the monster as much as eight or nine hours a day with this stuff.  This is a little like trying to write a full-length biography of a still-born baby.  The networks end up interviewing delegates and candidates over and over again, asking them the same insipid questions, occasionally shifting to the speaker at the rostrum, and then concluding, as Walter Cronkite concluded Tuesday night, that this session was \"sometimes dull.\"</span></p> <p><span>In a real sense, the Convention is actually what happens on TV and in the press rooms in the basement of the Fontainebleau Hotel, the butt of even more jokes than the Grand Old Party itself.  For a convention is nothing more than groups of delegates making decisions state by state--perhaps after meeting with one or more of the hotel-hopping Presidential aspirants, but more likely way before arriving in Miami Beach.  But it is only in the basement of the Fontainebleau that all these decisions are collated and sent out over the wires as comprehensive polls of the delegates.  This is the quintessence of the pre-vote period of the convention--predicting who is going to win, and on what ballot.</span></p> <p><span>There are some aspects of all this convention action that cannot be culled from the press and TV.  Perhaps the most important is the hotel-hopping.  On Tuesday, having decided to take the afternoon off, I picked up my bathing suit and drove with a friend to the Versailles Hotel, where I would swim as his guest.  As we walked up to the hotel door, a car swooped by, the doors opened simultaneously, and four men hopped out, wearing Secret Service badges.  As I got within ten yards of the door of the hotel, the crowd gathered outside began to scream, \"Here he comes, here comes Reagan.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>The Jewish Barber</b></span></p> <p><span>For an instant, I felt like the Jewish barber played by Charlie Chaplin in <i>The Great Dictator</i> when he was mistaken for Hitler.  I thought the crowd was going to stomp on me the way I had seen another crowd stomp on Rockefeller the day before and the way I knew this one was itching to stomp on Reagan.  And in a way, I wanted to get up there on somebody's shoulders and render a version of Charlie's corny speech in which I would tell all those Reagan supporters a thing or two about the problems of this nation.  But the spell was broken when Reagan himself drove up, smiling and waving, and worked his way through the crush to an elevator, which the Secret Service would not allow anyone else to enter.</span></p> <p><span>This, I now know, went on all day in triplicate.  Each hotel was broken out of its lull for only a minute or two, until the candidate went upstairs to meet with a delegation, but the candidates and their staff were working all day long.</span></p> <p><span>The supporters of the candidates, mostly young people, showed up in groups of forty or fifty at these hotel entrances, basically because there was nothing else for them to do.  By Monday, they had buttoned and pinned everyone who would be buttoned and pinned.  After that, they served primarily as walking advertisements, especially the very attractive girls in Rocky dresses.  But what does a walking advertisement do to fill up the hours in her day?</span></p> <p><span><b>Dried Up Oranges</b></span></p> <p><span>That then, is what a convention is all about.  Candidates, trailed by their faithful, talk to many delegates.  Delegates stick together with their own states.  Newsmen by the thousands scurry about squeezing juice out of dried up oranges and Republican leaders toss out more partisan crap than any thinking human being should be asked to tolerate.</span></p> <p><span>Governor Rockefeller said recently that this campaign was the most exciting thing he's ever done in his life, and he looks like he feels that way about this Convention too.  Delegates, who are spending generally between $400 and $1200 dollars for their week here, say it is an experience not to be missed.  One uncommitted Kansas delegate, a 61-year old lawyer, told me with obvious pride that Governor Rockefeller had personally called his home a week ago to talk to him.</span></p> <p><span>For most reporters, the Convention is something we have to live with, because no one has thought of anything better.</span></p> <p><span>For me, as I write this a few hours before Wednesday night's voting session, the Republican Convention is something of a joke.  When Mayor Lindsay and Sen. John Tower of Texas can agree on a Vietnam plank although one is a dove and one a super hawk, when Rockefeller can talk about winning (and the New York <i>Times</i> can try so hard to believe him) at a convention whose delegates go wild for Barry Goldwater and give a louder ovation to Max Rafferty than to Mayor Lindsay, when Gov. Spiro T. Agnew of Maryland can switch his allegiance from Rockefeller because of a personal slight and end up making the nominating speech for Nixon it makes me wonder about the efficacy of the two party system and especially of the nominating process.</span></p> <p><span>But I wouldn't think of discussing my doubts here, in the doubly unfriendly atmosphere of a conservative Republican Convention and Miami Beach.  When I arrived at the airport, I got a ride from a friend of someone I knew on the plane.  The man, born in Georgia, had a Wallace sticker on his car.  He drove us back to his house for a drink and while there said, \"Excuse me, I have to wash my hands.  I shook hands a while back with a nigger.\"  Of course, I thought it best to say nothing to him about his politics.  But three days later I feel the same way about the whole GOP convention.</span></p>"}

O'Neill, whose district includes Cambridge, is expected to announce this weekend he is endorsing Sen. Eugene J. McCarthy (D-Minn) for president, according to informed sources.</span></p> <p><span><b>Hung Up</b></span></p> <p><span>When asked for confirmation of the report early last evening, Cong. O'Neill hung-up without answer.  His Boston office would neither deny nor confirm the report.  By co-incidence, however, his office is preparing a new biography of the Congressman for release shortly.</span></p> <p><span>O'Neill is pledged by law to McCarthy for the first ballot at the Democratic National Convention because of the Minnesota Democrat's victory in the April Massachusetts presidential primary.  The Bay State Congressman, a member of the powerful House Rules Committee and an eight-term incumbent, is the first major Massachusetts Democratic office-holder to endorse McCarthy.</span></p> <p><span><b>Vietnam Summer</b></span></p> <p><span>Many expected O'Neill's move to McCarthy.  He broke with the Johnson Administration on the War in Vietnam last August after a major anti-war canvassing campaign (Vietnam Summer) in his district aimed specifically at him.  His call for de-escalation at the time surprised his House colleagues and reportedly angered President Johnson.</span></p> <p><span>Nevertheless, O'Neill backed President Johnson for re-election early last December following a McCarthy effort at the time to win his backing.  After Johnson withdrew in March, O'Neill refused to back either Humphrey or Kennedy.</span></p> <p><span><b>Pressure</b></span></p> <p><span>Again this summer liberals in O'Neill's ethnically heterogeneous district put pressure on him--this time to vote for McCarthy or at least against Humphrey.  Thousands of letters supposedly were written urging him as a delegate to vote for the Minnesota Democrat.  McCarthy forces made moves to organize a campaign to defeat him in the September Massachusetts Democratic primary.</span></p> <p><span>The anti-O'Neill primary campaign by McCarthyites exists no longer.  Instead a member of the \"inner circle\" of the U.S. House of Representatives has joined the McCarthy campaign.</span></p> <p><span><b>Demonstration</b></span></p> <p><span>As part of \"National McCarthy Day\" (August 15), Massachusetts McCarthy forces are organizing a massive demonstration on the Boston Common August 15 to show \"the politician's of McCarthy's support by the people.\"</span></p>"}

She said the Center has already secured a Methodist church on North Armitage St. in Chicago for the Boston demonstrators.</span></p> <p><span>The Boston Movement Center in Chicago will have a 24-hour-a-day doctor on hand, Miss Erenstein said, and will be able to coordinate legal aid.  It will plan certain demonstrations, such as a support demonstration for striking telephone workers in Chicago.</span></p> <p><span>The center is chartering round trip flights to Chicago, and round trip buses as well.  Miss Erenstein said she has no idea at this time how many people will sign up, although she emphasized that many people will be going to Chicago without contacting this office.  The center is distributing leaflets throughout the Boston area.</span></p> <p><span>It is not clear how many demonstrators of various stripe will appear in Chicago during convention week.  The National Mobilization Committee estimates it will attract 100,000.  Allard Lowenstein said he expects the Coalition for an Open Convention to attract 150,000.  Many small coordinating centers are being set up in Chicago, but most are along ideological rather than geographical lines.</span></p> <p><span>Miss Erenstein said she does not expect the divergent points of view among Boston people traveling to Chicago to cause problems.  \"Most of us agree that we are disenfranchised,\" she said.  \"I think the difference between Resistance people and the McCarthy supporters won't be that great if and when Humphrey is nominated.\"</span></p> <p><span>Sen. McCarthy said earlier this week that he did not wish his supporters to come to Chicago unless they had specific campaign jobs.  Miss Erenstein said this plea is not stopping many McCarthy supporters, and she said she has heard McCarthy staff workers say privately they would like big crowds.</span></p>"}

He is warning \"educators, public officals and law enforcement officers\" not to ignore \"the revolutionary terrorism invading college campuses.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Under the guise of academic freedom and freedom of speech,\" Hoover explains, students really are treacherously seeking \"a confrontation with established authority,\" and even dare to try \"to 'restructure' our society.\"</span></p> <p><span>Academic freedom and freedom of speech have been making their appearance more and more often in the subordinate clauses of the rhetoric of 1968 (\"Although our nation has always cherished the right of dissent, we cannot...\") and unhappily Hoover's call to repression is not just the babble of one senile totem.</span></p> <p><span>A housewife asked Richard Nixon in his first \"citizen's panel\" campaign TV show, what he thought about all the Commies teaching our youths on college campuses.

Here, state by state, you can see how they are progressing and what the individual plans are.  Compiled by</i> ROBERT H. KRIM.</span></p> <p><span>Note--NDC stands for the New Democratic Coalition which is a group of dovish anti-Administration forces who are liberals.  The \"party\" referred to is the Democratic Party.</span></p> <p><span><b>Alabama</b></span></p> <p><span>The biracial liberal National Democratic Party (NDP) which left Chicago unrecognized is running 160 candidates for office this fall in preparation for a future legitimization move within the national party.  Leader John Cashin, a Huntsville dentist, is attempting to set up a parallel party structure.  The major question in state politics will probably be answered folowing the November election, will Wallace's old-line party withdraw all the way down to the precinct-level from the national Democratic Party?</span></p> <p><span><b>Alaska</b></span></p> <p><span>The party will probably remain in the moderate hands of men like Humphreyite Mike Gravel, the party senatorial candidate.  New Democratic Coalition organizers haven't made contact with state liberals yet, though they will probably work through retiring Sen.  Ernest Greuning '07, an early dove, who Gravel deleated in a recent primary.  McCarthy forces were weak.</span></p> <p><span><b>Arizona</b></span></p> <p><span>Following the September 27 party county conventions, liberals will probably control about forty per cent of the party apparatus--a significant gain over a year ago--and have an excellent possibility of winning a majority in 1970 under the progressive leadership of the Udall brothers--Cong.  Morris and retiring Interior Secretary Stewart.</span></p> <p><span>The liberal block, based in Maricopa County Phoenix) with about half the state's population) and Tucson (University of Arizona), hasn't yet formed a coalition with the large--still unmilitant-brown (Mexican-American) community, but that may soon change.  With Barry Goldwater's victory in a November Senate contest all but assured, the conservative party apparatus, long nurtured by retiring Sen.  Carl Hayden's patronage, will suffer a serious setback opening the way for a 1970 liberal coup.</span></p> <p><span><b>Arkansas</b></span></p> <p><span>Liberal party members are few and far between, many have joined moderate Governor Winthrop Rockefeller's Republican Party. Sen. J. W. Fulbright is about the best party members can hope for especially while Wallace's growing support threatens even moderate elements of the party.</span></p> <p><span><b>California</b></span></p> <p><span>Kennedy and McCarthy liberals have overwhelming control of whatever party organization exists and have demonstrated popular support in all party primaries.  The name of the game is \"Big Daddy\" Speaker Jesse Unruh who wants the gubernatorial nod in 1970.  Up against Kennedy-man Unruh in '70 will probably be San Francisco Mayor \"the John Lindsay of the West\" Joseph Alioto who, though nominating Humphrey in Chicago, is still very much a liberal on policy.</span></p> <p><span>Although the large and very liberal California Democratic Council (CDC) which backed McCarthy from the beginning suffered defeat in the close and then tragic June presidential primary, it is the major organized force on the Democratic side.  The CDC is policy-oriented and very much into the new politics of mass media and coalitions with black and brown (Mexican-American) peoples.</span></p> <p><span><b>Connecticut</b></span></p> <p><span>The recently united Kennedy-McCarthy forces face an uphill battle in overthrowing the rule of party \"czar\" John Bailey in what was--until McCarthy and the war--a very strong and single-minded party which brooked little in-fighting.  With a Nixon landslide in 1968 and scandle-ridden hawkish Senator Dodd up for re-election in 1970, the liberals with Senator Ribicoff's leadership may be able to pull off a coup before the 1972 elections.</span></p> <p><span>The coalition under McCarthyite the Rev. Joseph Duffey is concentrating on re-electing Ribicoff in '68 (hated by the old guard after his anti-Daley Chicago speech), on lobbying for a progressive legislative program in '69, and taking on Dodd in '70.  They are furiously building a grass-roots organization.</span></p> <p><span><b>Colorado</b></span></p> <p><span>A coalition of Kennedy and McCarthy forces took party control in July.  They hope to consolidate their victory at a March, 1969 state central committee meeting, following a probable GOP sweep in local contests.  Under the new chairmanship of Kennedy supporter Robert Maytag (as in washing machine), the state central committee has already built a New Politics-style coalition with Denver blacks.</span></p> <p><span><b>District of Columbia</b></span></p> <p><span>The Kennedy slate won the May 7 primary defeating a pro-Humphrey slate.  Under the Rev. Channing E. Phillips the D.C. anti-Administration--and to a large extent progressive black--forces have taken control of the party.  The Phillips leadership will probably join the new Democratic Coalition.</span></p> <p><span><b>Delaware</b></span></p> <p><span>Though the Kennedy-McCarthy organization which came close to defeating the party machine in New-castle County (greater Wilmington--sixty per cent of the state) has officially disbanded, most of its serious politicos have joined the newly founded Delaware Conference of Concerned Democrats.  The new group has long-range hopes of taking over the conservative state organization now controlled by Gov. Charles Terry Jr. Led by activist housewife Mrs. Gilbert Sloan, the Concerned Democrats are backing liberal congressional candidate Harris MacDowell and trying to reform state election procedures.  Party elections come in 1971.</span></p> <p><span><b>Florida</b></span></p> <p><span>The Miami-based Florida Concerned Democrats (FCD) may be able to take a few party posts in 1970, but only because party posts mean little in this state.  The FCD is predominately Jewish now in this largely redneck state.  Even if the FCD joins a real coalition of black-browns, and white liberals, they would stand only a slim chance of controlling party candidates in the conservative party.</span></p> <p><span><b>Georgia</b></span></p> <p><span>There are two legal Democratic parties in the state--no one knows what will happen, though the traditional party of Gov. Lester Maddox might reconstitute itself after November as a grass roots Wallacite party.  A biracial coalition of white urban liberals like Charles Longstreet Weltner from progressive Altanta and black community leader state Rep. Julian Bond comprise the new party.  Old-style moderates like former Gov. Carl Sanders and Atlanta Mayor Ivan Allen will soon have to make a decision on which party--the redneck Maddox majority or the chronic minority liberals--they will go with.</span></p> <p><span><b>Hawaii</b></span></p> <p><span>Moderate Sen. Daniel K. Inouye and the relatively conservative state party organization have a strong grip; liberals are weak and unorganized.</span></p> <p><span><b>Idaho</b></span></p> <p><span>Sen. Frank Church is the state's liberal movement now, but that might be changing.  Democrats are weak and socially inferior in this conservative state.  McCarthy forces led by Robert Hart '68 built a grassroots organization which may serve as a base to build a liberal issue-oriented movement in the next four years.  Liberal Republicans were badly defeated in 1966 and might be persuaded to vote for the opposition if progressive candidates backed by socially-acceptable forces can be found.  Hart is the man to watch; McCarthy workers have joined Church's tough re-election battle this fall.</span></p> <p><span><b>Illinois</b></span></p> <p><span>With a predicted GOP landslide repudiating the machine's political judgment (\"machines must not only make the choice, but the right one,\" as one ward boss said) coupled with Daley's long-announced retirement in '71, a New Politics coalition of urban blacks (like Chicago Alderman Raney), white suburban liberals (like North Shore party leader Williams), and down-state forces (like Richard Mudge of Edwardsville) is a serious possibility.  A liberal coalition of such size could force major concessions from what is left of the machine.  This fall McCarthy forces are fighting a hopeless battle against Sen. Dirksen for liberal William Clark, a Daley choice who turned dove against his master's will an dlost the Mayor's financial support.  The race gives the liberals a chance to tool-up for the liberation struggle.</span></p> <p><span><b>Indiana</b></span></p> <p><span>In a state where conservative Gov. Roger D. Branigan could call the Kennedys \"outside agitators\" last April, things are improving rapidly for the liberals.  Facing a GOP sweep, the party gubernatorial candidate Rock asked McCathy co-ordinator and professor James Bogle to head his \"Citizens for Rock\" group.  About twenty per cent of party boss Gordon St. Angelo's precincts are now under liberal control.  Following the November election, the old McCarthy organization and a few other liberals (Kennedy imported his May primary machine, leaving few Kennedyites) will gather to form a permanent political group to work within the party for progressive party and elected officials.  By the 1970 party elections this New Politics group--hopefully with sizable black community support--expects to be a significant group.  Purdue professor Robert Toale is the man to watch.</span></p> <p><span><b>Iowa</b></span></p> <p><span>Like Colorado this state has become a model for a liberal take-over.  In February, 1968 a struggling band of peaceniks started a McCarthy organization.  It dug in at the grassroots and came up with this traditional Republican state's first viable Democratic political organization by July.  It is liberal, extremely dynamic, and lead by popular Gov. Harold Hughes who nominated McCarthy in Chicago.</span></p> <p><span><b>Kansas</b></span></p> <p><span>The McCarthy campaign was never very extensive in the state; the liberals are poorly organized; the future at this point is not very bright.  There are a few hopeful signs, however, the black militant community--particularly the Topeka health worker's unions--have had good rapport with McCarthy forces, and may provide the basis for a bi-racial coalition.  The reformers met scattered success in the August party primary--they now control about fifteen per cent of the precincts.  Liberals have high level allies within the party hierachy who may be able to help if a liberal coalition can get off the ground as it did in Colorado.</span></p> <p><span><b>Kentucky</b></span></p> <p><span>Though comprising only about a third of the party, a developing liberal coalition based on black and white liberal cooperation might just take control of the party in 1969 through sheer activism.  In any case the liberals will probably take control of the party apparatus in greater Louisville and Lexington (the University of Kentucky).</span></p> <p><span>With the impending Humphrey disaster which will probably carry the senatorial candidate down to defeat, an active liberal campaign by Kennedyite Michael Mills for the 1969 gubernatorial nomination against the dispirited regulars could conceivably put Mills in office.  Once in office the patronage--which still controls vitually all the politics in the poverty-stricken eastern part of the state--could give the liberals control.</span></p> <p><span><b>Louisiana</b></span></p> <p><span>The old Southern conservative wing of the party still controls the state.  A coalition of the weak white liberal forces and new black leadership may emerge in the not too distant future.</span></p> <p><span><b>Maine</b></span></p> <p><span>A newly formed and largely middle class Reform Democrats of Maine under the leadership of Bowdoin professor John C. Resenbrink hope to stem the party's growing \"complacency and conservatism\".  The new group represents a real coalition of Kennedy and McCarthy people.  Legislative lobbying and the 1970 party elections are the two objectives of the reformers activities.  Resenbrink's group will be building at the grass-roots for the next two years in high hopes of taking over the state party.  Most observers consider a coup unlikely in a state where labor is still loyal and Senator or vice president Muskie is both important and progressive.</span></p> <p><span><b>Maryland</b></span></p> <p><span>Except for dovish Sen. Joseph D. Tydings's personal organization, anti-administration liberals are unorganized.  Suburban Washington's Montgomery County served as a McCarthy base in this politically Southern state where George Wallace did so well in the 1964 presidential primary vote (forty-two per cent).  Baltimore is still very much a machine stronghold.  New Democratic Coalition national forces hope to organize a liberal-reform group in a coalition with an emerging black leadership before the 1970 election to help re-elect Tydings and give some clout to lightweight liberals.</span></p> <p><span><b>Massachusetts</b></span></p> <p><span>Though McCarthy forces were dealt a setback in last week's congressional races, they hope to re-group after November and form a left, reform faction within the party.  The goal is to organize in each city and town to control as many votes as possible at the June, 1970 party convention whcih nominates constitutional officers.  Convention delegates are chosen by the town and city party committees.</span></p> <p><span>In the aftermath of Chicago much of the McCarthy organization -- particularly in the academic community and the Republicans and Independents who joined the party for McCarthy--want to leave the party.  State McCarthy leaders Jerry Grossman, Paul Counihan, and state Rep. Irving Fishman should be watched for further developments on the new left reform organization.</span></p> <p><span><b>Michigan</b></span></p> <p><span>Following Humphrey's defeat in November, the new liberal coalition of urban blacks and white suburbanites centered around Detroit and Lansing will in all probability take control of the party from old, worn labor-liberal leadership.  In the early August party primaries, however, the bi-racial coalition which now calls itself the New Caucus took more than forty per cent of the state.  Their muscle was reflected in the September 1 state convention when party leaders in a harmony effort neglected to bring up a resolution calling for a Humphrey endorsement.  With Humphrey's anticipated defeat, New Caucus forces will probably be able to gain important allies of Detroit Mayor Jerry Cavanagh and black Cong. John Conyors' power and take the party leadership.</span></p> <p><span><b>Minnesota</b></span></p> <p><span>McCarthy forces came very close to winning party control last spring.  By the time McCarthy himself comes up for re-election in November, 1970, the party should be under the control of liberal militant forces allied with the senior senator.  Because of McCarthy's distain for party politics, the new leadership--while with him in spirit--can hardly be considered a personal organization.  While the campaign continues this fall, the New Democratic Coalition (the McCarthy forces) are organizing themselves again in each congressional district.  With strong control already in Minneapolis-St. Paul (about one third of the state), they are moving to take over out-state areas like Rochester where they came very close last spring.  Twentyfive year-old former SDS official Vance Opperman, chairman of the Hennepin County (Minneapolis) party, is a man to be watched.  Many consider Opperman--the epitome of the New Politics-style--the next \"boy mayor\" of Minneapolis, a title once held by one Hubert H. Humphrey.</span></p> <p><span><b>Mississippi</b></span></p> <p><span>Though the Loyal Democrats of Mississippi, a coalition of blacks lead by Charles Evers and white liberals like newspaper editor Hodding Carter, is the <i>de jure</i> party following its victory in Chicago last month it is not the <i>de facto</i> party.  This presents massive confusion, since the old party led by Gov. John Bell Wliliams refuses to cease operation.  The loyal coalition now have to run candidates for local and state posts who can win--making the party a reality.  The new party will probably concentrate on local and legislative battles.</span></p> <p><span><b>Missouri</b></span></p> <p><span>Potentially strong liberal forces have not gotten together in any meaningful way yet, they desperately need good leadership.  McCarthy forces made impressive liberal gains in suburban St. Louis this spring, but have failed to align themselves with the progressive black community leaders in the inner city.  Instead they are associated with the old Negro bosses who are on the way out.  In Kansas City McCarthyites dumped the last remnants of the Pendergast machine with whom Harry S. Truman got his start a half-century ago.  But the McCarthyites have failed to unite with the Kennedy forces and the black community which means a liberal party takes over is impossible for the present.</span></p> <p><span><b>Montana</b></span></p> <p><span>McCarthyites came close to taking the state convention delegation this probably as a significant minority.  They control about one third of the party now according to McCarthy leader Tom Towe, a Billings lawyer.  Though nothing definite has been decided, McCarthyites and some Kennedy supporters are talking of building a Montana Democratic Council along the lines of California.  Party elections are in October, 1969--the liberal bid for power will probably come at the time.  The old guard will put up a strong resistance.</span></p> <p><span><b>Nebraska</b></span></p> <p><span>A non-partisan legislature and local government make the party organization of little importance.  The conservative Douglas County (Omaha--half the state) \"courthouse gang\" is about the only machine worth attacking.  This the largely McCarthyite, newly-founded Nebraska Democratic Coalition is seeking to defeat in the April '69 Omaha mayoralty elections.  Founded by Omaha lawyer Frank Martin Jr., the Coalition has brought in significant black support from the Northside ghetto of Omaha.  The Kennedy forces who remained following the May primary have joined the Coalition.  If the liberals take Omaha next year and can organize as well as they did in the '68 Presidential preference primary, then they will control the state.</span></p> <p><span><b>Nevada</b></span></p> <p><span>There was little liberal anti-war McCarthy activity in the state his year.  NDC national forces have no plans at this point of going into the state.</span></p> <p><span><b>New Hampshire</b></span></p> <p><span>McCarthy did much more than win forty-two per cent of the presidential primary vote last March; he brought about a revolution in the state party's politics on the side.  McCarthy forces under the leadership of Dartmouth instructor David C. Hoeh, a congressional candidate, won about forty-five per cent of party precincts in an early September primary election.  They are very close to electing a McCarthyite party chairman.  Where most of Gene's organization last winter were out-of-state college students, the liberals have now developed native leadership in town after town.  The Nixon landslide is expected to defeat Hoeh and most other major Democratic candidates; the McCarthy leadership just hopes to run ahead of other party candidates to prove the Granite State's dove power once again.</span></p> <p><span><b>New Jersey</b></span></p> <p><span>Even the regular party machine leaders believe that if Kennedy, McCarthy, and black community leaderships continue to work together, they can probably become the major force in the party.  Recent elections have brought major setbacks leaving a semivacuum for the party.  If the newly politicized McCarthy forces in suburban New York and Philadelphia will remain active in the party and run for office, they will change the whole nature of the party and will probably receive old guard backing.  After the election, the Kennedy-McCarthy coalition of last summer will meet to plan further action.  There is plenty to work for with Gov. Richard Hughes retiring.  Next year is a gubernatorial and legislative election year.</span></p> <p><span><b>New York</b></span></p> <p><span>The only man who could bring any order to the state's byzantine party politics was assassinated in California in June.  Liberals control the party to a certain extent, but their factionalization prevents any power plays on a national level at this point.  Two coalitions of McCarthy and Kennedy forces are under way.  The McCarthyite Coalition for a Democratic Alternative will probably die with party senatorial candidate Paul O'Dwyer's defeat in November.  Though still in its formative stages, the Coalition for the Politics of the People hopes to become an issue-oriented reformist coalition in a state which has seen too many reform movements and many abortive coalitions.  Stephen Smith, Paul O'Dwyer, Allard K. Lowenstein, and Percy Sutton are among the men to watch.</span></p> <p><span><b>North Carolina</b></span></p> <p><span>A white liberal-black coalition which fought a hard battle for McCarthy last summer controls about fifteen per cent of the party structure.  The liberals are surprisingly well organized for such a Wallacite state.  The coalition is strongest in Chapel Hill (the University of North Carolina), Durham, and to a certain extent Charlotte where a strong coalition came very close to winning last vear.  The biracial forces will shoot for city posts in 1969 and seizure of country organizationa control whereever possible.</span></p> <p><span><b>North Dakota</b></span></p> <p><span>The McCarthy people put together a strong grass roots organization in the state this year.  Future plans are not known at the present time.</span></p> <p><span><b>New Mexico</b></span></p> <p><span>A coalition of McCarthy and Kennedy (with strong, progressive Mexican-American support) forces is very close to taking over the state organization.  They controlled about forty-five per cent of last summer's party convention and won a proportionate number of seats on the national convention delegation.  Party elections are in January; following the November elections the Kennedy-McCarthy coalition hopes to organize precinct by precinct to rest control from the corrupt party organization in January.</span></p> <p><span>Most of the coalition activists are working hard for liberal gubernatorial nominee Fabian Chavez, the first brown gubernatorial nominee in half a century.</span></p> <p><span><b>Ohio</b></span></p> <p><span>Unity and leadership is badly needed by both the liberals and the party itself.  If the new leadership is liberal, they can probably have the party.  Party senatorial nominee John Gilligan who gave up labor support rather than make a pre-convention endorsement of Humphrey will be swept under in the Nixon landslide.  Young liberals like Dick Celeste of Cleveland formerly of the Peace Corps are hoping to build \"a tangible issue orientation\" within the party.  From that base they might work out to local and then state-wide candidate contests.  Gilligan, U.S. Rep. Charles Vanik, former astronaut John Glenn, and black Humphreyite Cleveland Mayor Carl Stokes all may play prominent roles in a liberal-based party move to retake the state from a decade of GOP control.</span></p> <p><span><b>Oklahoma</b></span></p> <p><span>The conservative state is becoming more Republican each vear.  In this context pro-war liberals like Sen.  Fred Harris, co-chairman of Humphrey's pre-convention drive, are about the best McCarthy supporters expect.  Moderates should continue to hold the party.  In academic centers like Stillwater and Norman, McCarthy generated significant grass-roots organization.  In Tulsa and Oklahoma City, liberals tended more to Kennedy, but worked for McCarthy in most cases following the assassination.</span></p> <p><span><b>Oregon</b></span></p> <p><span>Liberal McCarthvites have control of the party--but barely.  They realize consolidation and a strong issue-base are the only answers to the problem.  To meet it, a reformists league--either tightly knit like the CDC or a non-partisan group like ADA--will get together after the election.  McCarthy and Kennedy people never merged following the assassination, since the McCarthy slate had been elected in the May primary.  Much of the Kennedy organization was out-of-state, leaving the McCarthy machine few with which to form a viable coalition.  Re-electing Sen.  Wayne Morse occupy most liberals this fall.</span></p> <p><span><b>Pennsylvania</b></span></p> <p><span>Though McCarthy won the April presidential primary with the help of a substantial organization, most liberals are not hopeful that they will triumph over the entrenched machines.  In the East, Philadelphia Mayor Tate runs \"the forces of evil\" as one McCarthy worker described it and in the West, Pittsburg Mayor Barr.</span></p> <p><span>The McCarthy forces have formed an insurgent reformist group, the Coalition of Independent Democrats and Independents to try to take over the party.  This fall they will fight for Sen. Joseph Clark's re-election; later they will attempt to build the grass-roots organization to overthrow \"the forces of evil.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>Rhode Island</b></span></p> <p><span>An active McCarthy-Kennedy coalition has formed the Coalition for the New Politics which will work within the party to wrest control from the Doorley machine in Providence and the conservative organization at a state level.  With Brown student Leonard O'Brien, chairman of Rhode Island Students for Kennedy, challenging a Doorley candidate in Providence this fall, the liberal move has begun.  Leaders of the Coalition are state Sen.  Mrs. Eleanor Slater and Newport councilman David Fenton.  Sen. John O. Pastore can be expected to aid the old guard if the challenge becomes serious.</span></p> <p><span><b>South Carolina</b></span></p> <p><span>Blacks mounted several congressional campaigns this spring and showed some voting strength.  The New Democratic Coalition has no contacts yet with liberal forces within the conservative state.</span></p> <p><span><b>South Dakota</b></span></p> <p><span>Sen. George S. McGovern's organization is the liberal group at this point.  They have strong influence in party affairs.</span></p> <p><span><b>Tennessee</b></span></p> <p><span>Liberals from a minority of the party and probably will for some time to come.  McCarthy forces under Charles Stevenson '64 ran a strong campaign for so conservative a state with concentrated support in Nashville, Knoxville, and Oak Ridge.  They developed strong ties with black moderates and militants; the Negro power structure, while sympathetic, is still aligned with the old guard machine led at this time by Gov. Buford Ellington.  With constant work liberals can have a serious influence on the party stance and elect progressive local and legislative officers.</span></p> <p><span><b>Texas</b></span></p> <p><span>About the best strategy liberals can follow in this conservative state is to elect a Republican governor.  With the conservative party power structure out of power, there might be a chance for the factionalized liberal chronic minority to take over the party in primary elections.  Blacks and browns have excercised little voting power in the past, though in a new coalition with the white liberals here is hope that this can be changed by registration drives and progressive local candidates.  This group, the Texas Democratic Coalition, primarily McCarthyite, is setting up a parallel party structure across the state.  Other liberals are actively working for the GOP gubernatorial nominee, setting up the New Texas Party with a McCarthy-Lindsay ticket, and working to keep the only important liberal in office when he comes up for re-election in 1970--Sen. Ralph Yarborough.</span></p> <p><span><b>Utah</b></span></p> <p><span>Liberal forces have a lot of building to do at a very basic level if they are ever to challenge the moderate party organization.  They put together a fairly strong organization for McCarthy this year.  The state party chairman A. Wally Sandack voted for McCarthy in Chicago.</span></p> <p><span><b>Vermont</b></span></p> <p><span>With Gov. Phillip A. Hoff, a McCarthy supporter, at the head of the party and the only significant Democratic office-holder in the past few years, liberals have played an important part in the decision-making.  The 7000-member McCarthy organization--with a heavy dose of academicians--will probably go for a Democratic Coalition like the CDC after the election.  Affluent McCarthyites have increased their control by giving generously this fall to moderate party candidates.  If Hoff runs for the U.S. Senate in 1970, the liberal Coalition will most likely provide his base of support.</span></p> <p><span><b>Virginia</b></span></p> <p><span>With the state growing rapidly the conservative Byrd-machine which ruled it for several decades has steadily declined during the '60's.  In its place three distinct factions have risen.  Though the Byrd-machine placed Gov. Mills E. Godwin in office, he has gradually shifted over to the moderate faction of the party; the moderates under Sen. William B. Sprong's leadership are a swing group who now have widespread electoral support; the liberals led by Henry Howell of Norfolk have significant organizational and electoral support in black urban areas and white suburban communities around the District of Columbia as well as in Norfolk.  If the moderates and conservatives don't unite behind moderate gubernatorial candidate William Battle in the 1969 party primary, then Howell, the liberal choice, may win the nomination--although probably lose the general election to a strong GOP candidate.  In either case, the liberal faction, while now just a strong minority, will gain power as the state continues its de-Southernization campaign.</span></p> <p><span><b>Washington</b></span></p> <p><span>\"The state has a relatively simple organization to crack,\" said one McCarthy operative.  The McCarthyites were brutally put down in party caucuses last summer and they are mad.  They are mad enough to form a Washington Democratic Council (WDC) along the lines of the CDC to try to take over the party.  \"A lot of people are determined to stick around the party and do some homework; the only real question is how easy it is to change the people into long-term politicians,\" Ed Voris said, a Seattle McCarthyite.</span></p> <p><span>Kennedy and McCarthy forces have worked together since the spring and will in the future.  The party has lost for too long--even a few of the more conservative office-holders wouldn't mind the McCarthyites helping to rebuild.  By 1970 or 1972 the Washington party will probably be in McCarthyite hands.</span></p> <p><span><b>West Virginia</b></span></p> <p><span>Real liberals of the McCarthy stripe are few and far between in this poverty-stricken state, but the moderate reformers like Sec. of State party nominee John D. Rockefeller IV are relatively liberal.  James Sprouce, a reformer won the party nomination after a long fight against one of the state's many close to corrupt party officials.  If he wins, the reformers will have control of the all important patronage to build themselves up for 1970.  A possible challenge for progressives in '70 is conservative Sen. Byrd. Men to watch are Sprouce and Rockefeller.</span></p> <p><span><b>Wisconsin</b></span></p> <p><span>The McCarthy campaign under Donald O. Peterson won the April primary and since then has taken over the party organization.  Even prominent Kennedy-backers like Pat Lucey are now part of the McCarthy-led liberal coalition (with significant black support in Milwaukee).  The grassroots organization which brought thousands of new people into the state politics is now fighting for Sen.  Gaylord Nelson's re-election.</span></p> <p><span><b>Wyoming</b></span></p> <p><span>\"The state organization is Senator Gale McGee,\" one prominent state politician said recently.  While McCarthy forces were active last summer, they have no plans to try to loosen McGee's control in the future.  Tino Roncalio, a Kennedy supporter and former congressman, is the leading liberal politician in the state.<c><n><i>This is Ted Kennedy surrounded by the People.  They have become active in politics and want to make important decisions about their lives.  In 1972 Ted will be nominated.  They hope to nominate him.  That is an important decision.  The only question to be answered is, who will nominate Ted, the People or other people?  The other people have worked in politics for many years and are no longer people.  Of course some of the People, after working for the next four years in politics, will no longer be People.  It's very complicated.  But Ted will be nominated anyway.</i></n></c></span></p>"}

{"title": "High School Graduates Who Can't READ?! | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><i>This is the second in a series.  The next installment will have anecdotes about Klan meetings, Wallace rallies, and other Southern phenomena.</i></span></p> <p><span>In one of its three stories with an Alabama dateline last month, the New York <i>Times</i> reported the death of a Negro in Prichard.  The article said:</span></p> <p><span>The body of a 34-year-old Negro man was found hanging by the heels Saturday outside an abandoned school house.  The police identified the victim as E. C. Deloach, a fork lift operator on the Mobile docks.</span></p> <p><span>Deloach's body, clad only in shorts and with slight cuts about the head and abdomen, was found hanging by a telephone cable from an eave of the Joshua Barney School, one of several Negro schools closed in the Mobile area this year when Federal courts ordered a speed-up in integration.</span></p> <p><span>Seven firebombings have been reported in the area in the last three weeks and there has been one clash between a Negro and a white at one of the newly integrated schools.</span></p> <p><span>\"There are no racial implications involved,\" said Detective Lieutenant R. L. Heathcoe.</span></p> <p><span>That kind of violence may be exceptional.  But the tension it reveals is not.  The Southern school system -- whose violent convulsions marked the beginning of the modern civil rights movement in 1954 -- is bracing for a new showdown.  And although Northerners find it hard to understand, this showdown will be far more important than any that have gone before.  More than the landmark 1954 Supreme Court decision or the spotty efforts to wipe out segregated schools that followed, the 1968 fight to give black children a decent education will determine the Negro's future in the South.</span></p> <p><span>But, as Negro leaders in the South know all too well, this is a showdown that will pass virtually unnoticed in the North.  Things have changed a lot since 1954.  Then Northern families could see clearly-cut right and wrong.  It wasn't hard to sense that the timid black children were right, and that the thick-necked Southern police were wrong.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>Going Underground</i></b></span></p> <p><span>Things have changed since then.  White suburbanites, feeling the push of black families moving into their neighborhoods, wary of the threatening black men they see rioting in the cities, are now less eager to ram integration down the Southern gullet.  George Wallace has found a constituency in the North that Strom Thurmond or Orval Faubus would never have won in 1954.</span></p> <p><span>Even before the white backlash set in, a number of other factors had conspired to make the Southern \"racial situation\" less visible than it had been in the '50's.  After the civil rights acts passed in the early '60's, most Northern whites breathed a sigh of moral relief.  Most of the tangible evidences of bigotry were gone:  federal inspectors found few \"Colored\" drinking fountains left.  The \"White Only\" posters were reluctantly removed from the train stations and busses; the black names made their way onto the voting lists; and whites and blacks settled down to the teeth-gritting reality of living together.</span></p> <p><span>But most Southern Negroes soon realized that these tentative victories were in reality a setback.  The evening TV news report had been one of the civil rights movement's primary weapons, but now much of its punch was gone.  There were no more marches, few boycotts, little redneck backlash.  The white Northern conscience turned to other things.  Students began to work against the war; white liberals set to work in the ghettos.  With no tangible goblins to fight, the Southern Negroes struggled for ways to keep the nation's support mobilized.</span></p> <p><span>Southern whites too were quick to see what was happening.  In many small towns, the seemingly cheery acquiescence to Northern laws was in reality a cagey poker-face cover for continued Southern resistance.  Bitter experience with the Northern press had convinced the whites that the best way to clamp down on Negro progress was to clamp down on Negro progress was to keep the press away; and the best way to do that was to avoid trouble.  So the \"White Only\" signs disappeared, and so did the press.</span></p> <p><span>In some areas, the token integration that the civil rights laws left was enough.  Negroes were content to be able to vote, even if their vote was accepted reluctantly.  They were willing, for a while, to ride the busses, even though hostile stares greeted them.  Jobs given reluctantly were a little better than none at all.  Half a share of American Life would not be satisfactory as a permanent solution, but perhaps it would do for several years.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>Blacks Marry Blacks</i></b></span></p> <p><span>But there was one area where tokenism was not acceptable.  Complete integration of the schools -- not merely the few black faces dotting the formerly-white classrooms -- was essential, the key to all future progress.</span></p> <p><span>Most Northerners find it hard to understand why school integration is so urgent a need in the South.  Liberals might rosily dream of the day when all little children could grow up together to love and understand each other at integrated schools; and their main objection to segregated schools seems to be that the children aren't growing up to love and understand.  Blunter Northerners see no real danger in separate-but-equal schools; just like blacks marry blacks and whites marry whites, they say, people want to be with their own.  Why force them together?</span></p> <p><span>Northerners have the luxury of this speculation because they still believe -- somewhat subconsciously -- in the idea of Separate-But-<i>Equal.</i>  Few whites can really believe that Southern hatred could extend so far as to deny little children a good education.  A black man in the South, hearing that, would laugh.  Because Separate-But-Equal is a farce.</span></p> <p><span>You don't have to look too hard to see why.  White schools in the South are no gems -- Alabama ranks 49th among the school systems of the country, and Mississippi proudly follows at number 50.  But the eagerness of black children to get into the white schools suggests how bad the black schools must be.  And the suggestion of how bad they must be is only a pale hint of how bad they <i>are.</i></span></p> <p><span>Black schools in Alabama and Mississippi, without exception, are ramshackle, decaying, understaffed and overcrowded.  Alabama spends about $1500 per year for each white student in school.  That's not much, but it's more than twice as much as the state pays for black students.  Things are worse in Mississippi, where two years ago the state board of education coughed up a little less than $250 to pay for the education of each black student in the black schools.</span></p> <p><span>And it's not hard to see the effects of Separate-But-Unequal schools.  About one-half of all the Negro children who start school end up graduating from high school.  Actually, that's not as great a loss as it may seem; because those who make it out of the twelfth grade have only the equivalent of a sixth grade <i>Alabama</i> education.  A little less than two-thirds of black high school graduates are able to read.  Many are turned down by the military because they fail the elementary math and reading tests.</span></p> <p><span>The effect of this mass-production of uneducated black children is obvious.  Children who can't read turn into adults who can't get jobs.  Rednecks point to the black illiteracy statistics, to the numbers of blacks turned down by the military, and to the abysmal inability of black Southerners to get jobs, and use these as sociological proof of the cherished racist theories.  \"Them niggers will never be any good,\" they cheerily tell squirming visitors.  \"They's just so dumb that all they like to do is sit around an shoot pool.  Damn federal government comes down here tellin' us the niggers are as good as us.  All they gotta do is look at 'em to see they're no good.\"</span></p> <p><span>Even the more liberal Southerners sometimes fall into the \"Unqualified Nigras\" trap.  \"I wouldn't mind hirin' some of the nigras,\" a lumber-yard owner said last summer, \"but I just can't find any who know how to do the work.  They just can't read and learn the job or work steady.\"</span></p> <p><span>But in their secret moments, almost all of the Southerners seem to realize that the black schools have a fundamental relation with the continued black inferiority in the South.  The rednecks who will not admit that Negroes are \"just too dumb\" because they've been at shoddy schools seem to sense that if the Negroes invade the white schools, a change will be imminent.  And that is why school desegregation has become the last stand of the old white order.</span></p> <p><span>The history of desegregating schools is short and it is unpleasant.  For each progressive step, there seem to be two steps back.  In 1954, after 60 years of Supreme Court decisions allowing the dual school systems in the South, Earl Warren's court finally made the break.  Warren's decision had two memorable bits of language:  the first, now reverently recited by civil rights lawyers, is that \"separate schools are inherently in equal.\"  That was good.  But the other phrase almost negated the decision's value.</span></p> <p><span>The South wouldn't have to merge its two school systems all at once, Warren said.  Instead, it would have to take steps toward desegregation \"with all deliberate speed.\"  Negro parents, NAACP lawyers, and the few Northerners who were familiar with the situation soon learned to despise that phrase.</span></p> <p><span>The beginning of integration after the '54 decision was deceptively easy.  Black children, brave and resisting hostile taunts, went to white schools.  For a year, Southern school districts seemed beaten.  No one imagined that \"all deliberate speed\" could mean a very long time, and individual school boards from Arkansas to South Carolina quietly let Negroes into classes.</span></p> <p><span>Things finally erupted in Clinton, Tennessee.  After a <i>Life</i> photographer had done a story on \"Peaceful Integration In Clinton,\" Clinton's parents struck back.  Weeks of rioting and violence followed, and spread to other cities in the South.  The most important result was that Southerners learned that President Eisenhower was less than eager to jump into their affairs.  These things should be left to the states, Ike said; and the states were glad to have them.  It wasn't until the notorious Little Rock showdown of the mid fifties that federal force was used at all, and for the rest of Eisenhower's administration it was used only reluctantly.</span></p> <p><span>Things changed under Kennedy, but still there was little progress being made.  Individual blacks made it into Ole Miss and the University of Alabama, but the majority of black children still grew up and were miseducated in black schools.  It wasn't until 1962 that the next real step came:  the advent of the wholesome-sounding Freedom Of Choice plan.</span></p> <p><span>George Wallace, who had won his place in Alabamian hearts with his door-blocking stand at the University of Alabama, came out fuming when federal courts introduced the Freedom Of Choice plan.  To outsiders, it didn't sound too threatening.  It just said that any student could choose to go to any school he wanted; it seemed like basic American individual choice and everything good.  But in the South, it posed an immediate danger:  it meant that BLACK CHILDREN would be coming to the WHITE SCHOOLS.  The white South had to act fast.</span></p> <p><span>Alabama, the Cradle of the Confederacy, was the center of resistance.  George Wallace tuned up for his presidential campaign by swinging around the state, telling devotes about the perils of Freedom of Choice.  Those black children are goin' into the schools, George said, and that means that the whites ones are goin' to leave.  George said that he was shore nuff sorry, but it looked like the state of Alabama wouldn't be able to keep a public school system goin' no more, because there wouldn't be any support from the legislature and the entire white public would resist.</span></p> <p><span>The Federal judges in Alabama were not impressed.  They clamped down Freedom of Choice, and George Wallace, as he had done before in the University of Alabama doorway, backed down.  A few whites migrated to the private schools, but they came back soon.  Public schools continued.</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately, part of the reason that Wallace backed down was that he and everyone else saw quickly that Freedom of Choice wasn't much more of a threat than the old '54 order had been.  Because a black kid who was theoretically \"free\" to choose his school could be convinced in a lot of ways that he shouldn't choose the white schools.  Teachers and students could make it pretty miserable for pioneering black students.  If that did not give them the idea, employers and merchants could subtly let black parents know that their economic future would be brighter if their children \"chose\" the black schools.</span></p> <p><span>Even school boards thought up clever ploys.  In Greene County, the school board told Negro residents of Tishabee that their children could attend either the Greene County High School (white) or the Greene County Training School (black).  However, both schools were 20 miles from Tishabee, and the school board said that it was sorry, but it could only provide busses to the Training School.</span></p> <p><span>Once white Alabama learned about this soft underbelly of Freedom of Choice, the people who had resisted it so vehemently suddenly found themselves defending it as \"the best hope for quality education in our state.\"  Obviously it wasn't going to turn their schools into segregated ones; and if it did, it would do it more slowly than any other plan.  At the same time, the Justice Department and many black lawyers also realized that a new system was needed.  So they began yet another legal battle against the sturdy Southern schools.</span></p> <p><span>This summer's court session in Alabama saw two major trials, each illustrating one phase of the fight against Freedom of Choice.  The first, held in early August, was mainly valuable as a theatrical production.  The name of the suit--The United States of America vs.  The United Klans of America--hinted what kind of an affair it would be.  An inexperienced Justice Department lawyer brought a parade of 50 residents of Crenshaw County, Ala., to the stand and had them tell what the Klan had been doing to keep Freedom of Choice from working in the county's schools.</span></p> <p><span>The evidence was juicy.  Black parents told of cross-burnings, huge KKK's painted on their houses, midnight Klan rallies, and assorted other harrassments designed to keep black kids out of white schools.  A few reluctant white witnesses, appearing under Federal subpoena, grudgingly admitted that the white citizens of Crenshaw County had circulated a petition to enforce an economic boycott against all black families who integrated the schools.</span></p> <p><span>The defense's case was even more picturesque than the prosecution's.  Ira Dement, a sometimes-liberal lawyer with a hound-dawg face, cross-examined each of the black witnesses, always beginning with the question, \"Have you ever been convicted of a felony?\"  His defense case was as straightforward as it was absurd, consisting of character-witness testimony from assorted Klan members.</span></p> <p><span>That trial turned out all right.  The judge ordered an injunction prohibiting the Klan from giving the black people trouble.  But even the Justice Department realized that this was a short-term victory, and near the end of August Federal lawyers launched a massive court battle against the whole Freedom of Choice system.</span></p> <p><span>Working from statistics that showed that 97 per cent of Alabama's black children had \"chosen\" to stay in black schools, and quoting a Supreme Court ruling that invalidated Freedom of Choice when it didn't \"speedily end the dual school system,\" the Justice Department asked for more radical measures.  Specifically, it wanted the court to close many black schools and begin bussing and zoning plans to achieve racial balance in the schools.  And it wanted all of this done before the 1968 school year opened.</span></p> <p><span>The State of Alabama's case was identical to the one it had made earlier when Freedom of Choice was introduced.  If zoning and bussing start, Wallace protegee Gov. Albert Brewer said, whites will flee the shools, and the legislature will end the public school system.</span></p> <p><span>The court didn't buy Alabama's argument, but it still wouldn't end Freedom of Choice.  In a compromise decision, it gave the state one year to make Freedom of Choice work, and invited the Justice Department to file a new suit next summer if it has not.</span></p> <p><span>The decision made many Negroes pessimistic.  By next summer, it may be too late.  Even ardent Wallacites admit that Richard Nixon will probably be President by then, and many of them know that he has promised to call off the Justice Department suits.  So Freedom of Choice may go on, and the schools will continue.  And a more violent showdown may come</span></p>"}

President Johnson has refused to stop the bombing, and until it is stopped, the North Vietnamese are unwilling to discuss more fundamental issues.</span></p> <p><span>But it is irresponsibility as well as intransigeance that has marked these last months.  Our leaders, present and potential, are dealing with Vietnam on a purely partisan level, and the result has been a tragi-comedy of accusation and distortion.</span></p> <p><span>Five days ago Vice-President Hubert H.

{"title": "The Crusade Hits Indiana, Which Is Not The Promised Land | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>A</b>T THE airport, someone picked up a pamphlet titled \"How to Survive in Indianapolis\" from the Hertz girl.  We laughed.  Surely it wouldn't be all that difficult.  Our ride into headquarters had yet to show up.  The air terminal was quiet.  Two members of the Royal Laotian Army arrived and were greeted by a couple of U.S. soldiers.  An advance scouting party, we joked.  Or, perhaps, a remake of <i>The Manchurian Candidate.</i>  They were hurried off in a dung-colored government car.  So we stood, a few sat, in the middle of the lobby, 18 of us, sleeping bags, suitcases, and McCarthy buttons.  No one had told us crusading would be so much fun.</span></p> <p><span>Eventually we made it into downtown Indianapolis.  We had to go by taxi.  It wasn't that the McCarthy people couldn't supply enough cars to pick us up; their gas pool had run out of money.  The cabbie showed us the area's few points of interest.  Indianapolis is a city whose parks are littered with preserved tanks and artillery the way some people clutter their coffee tables with bronzed baby shoes.  Many of its public buildings are self-conscious copies of old Washington favorites.  Its war memorials offer some of the most embarrassing examples of social realism west of Leningrad.  And right smack in the center of the whole city is the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument -- a phallic shaft of stone topped by a 200-foot representation of a frightfully winged female, supposedly \"the happiest lady in town.\"</span></p> <p><span><b><i>Home of John Birch Society</i></b></span></p> <p><span>We were soon briefed on the city's more relevant distinctions.  Indianapolis is the site of the American Legion's National Headquarters; the home of the John Birch Society; and a few weeks earlier the Ku Klux Klan had received a permit for a full-dress parade down the main street.  Not quite the peace candidate's territory.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>T IS AN odd kind of war you must wage when you are not even allowed to dirty your hands.  But that is what we were told to do.  Keep it clean for Gene.  The staff was cynical, but serious about it.  Indiana was confused.  Its primary had never before attracted such national attention.  Suddenly crowds of students had made its capital a convention city without a convention.  The papers were already misrepresenting the Senator.  The cops would have loved to bust his kids.</span></p> <p><span>The Senator--despite the obvious confusion, we rarely used his surname when speaking among ourselves--set the tone of the campaign.  A kind of unavoidable, occasionally inopportune, honesty.  During the final week of the campaign, he suggested that Communists would probably have to be accepted in a Vietnamese coalition government.  Hardly a move motivated by the political realities of the state.  We found it difficult to be as scrupulous.  Someone mentioned that we might be asked whether the Senator was a relative of Joe McCarthy, and, well, we would have to decide for ourselves how to answer.</span></p> <p><span>Nonetheless, the operation really maintain the purity of a crusade.  Most of the staff was under 30; many had dropped out of college during the course of the spring semester to become more completely involved in the campaign.  We were assigned to Dave's storefront in Barrington.  Dave was one of the lucky ones.  He had managed to talk Northwestern into granting him a free term to examine the campaign in terms of his anthropology major.  Norm, his assistant, was more characteristic.  A few months earlier he had been a 5.0 student at the University of Illinois; he was now on pro.  Dave only knew two kids that had joined the campaign in hopes of future political gain.  The majority brought only the committed dedication that enabled them to survive on a salary of seven dollars a day.  They were punctilious in disciplining themselves.  Those who dated interracially were asked not to wear McCarthy buttons, not in Indiana.  Beer wasn't allowed at parties for the volunteers.  No one wanted the police to point out a minor drinking, however innocently.</span></p> <p><span>The staff hotel was demonstrative of their whole attitude.  The Antlers was seven blocks from headquarters and just a step away from becoming a bona fide flophouse.  The cockroaches attested to that.  Or the bathrooms that flooded with cold water whenever you tried to take a shower.  The single, cardboard elevator was operated by Maggie, a rough, surly old woman.  Single men were warned not to ride the elevator with her alone, especially if they were going all the way to the eighth floor.  The Antlers had been chosen for one reason--it was cheap.  The staff responded to the challenge.  Accordingly, Senator McCarthy announced his willingness to stay in the staff hotel when the campaign reached California.  If they were gutsy enough to take, so was he.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>Peanut Butter Sandwiches</i></b></span></p> <p><span>The student volunteers, McCarthy's weekend warriors, were even more enthusiastic.  Like World War I veterans, they loved to search out old friends and rehash the campaigns they had already seen.  Some had known the snow in New Hampshire, many more recalled the friendliness of Wisconsin.  For others, it was their first crusade.  For those of us from Harvard, reading period had made it easy to respond to latent activism.  McCarthy had become something of an intellectual's <i>cause celebre.</i>  As self-conscious, guilt-ridden liberals we joined the battle.</span></p> <p><span>No one seemed quite sure how many of us there were.  Some press accounts claimed 7,000 students had entered the state.  Mary McCarthy told reporters it was more like 9,000.  In Indianapolis alone, there were 2,500 of us.  All Friday night, reports kept reaching headquarters of groups still due to arrive:  some kids from central Massachusetts, flying half fare, had been bumped in New York, a bus had broken down in Ohio.  At midnight, they were still trying to house 300 unexpected volunteers.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HERE is a certain way people react to hurricanes and floods.  It is the same way New Yorkers approach day-to-day living.  You adopt a sort of crisis mentality.  You make your difficulties seem much larger, your stamina appear more courageous.  It is a marvelous game of competitive purported deprivation when played correctly.  The McCarthy volunteer revels in it.</span></p> <p><span>With no little degree of self-satisfaction, we slept on church floors and lived on peanut butter sandwiches.  During the last 36 hours of the campaign we hardly slept at all.  To be sure, there were exceptions.  Saturday afternoon, a rather unusual call came through:  four beds were offered to anyone from Harvard.  We quickly junked any egalitarian tendencies and accepted.  We never discovered just why we had been requested.  The house, an extremely comfortable place near the Governor's estate, was owned by a Nixon Republican and his wife, a Kennedy supporter.  Neither had any connection with Harvard.  They, like many others, had been impressed enough by the Senator's following to lend a little non-partisan support.</span></p> <p><span>At the same time, we were developing a certain contemptuousness for Kennedy's canvassers.  Many of them had been attracted by ads offering a free weekend in Indiana.  Some, we knew, received daily meal allowances; others, it was rumored, were being paid outright.  Often they were still in high school.  We derided the tactlessness of Bobby's teeny-boppers.  Of course, they tried to adopt our own air of self-sacrifice.  It was generally unsuccessful.  One giggly girl proudly announced that she and her friends would be spending the night in a church.  \"God must be on our side,\" she laughed.  Well, if He weren't, you'd buy Him, she was told.</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>E WERE assigned to Ward 14, in the southeastern corner of Indianapolis.  The ward was composed of five precincts.  Three belonged to the Negro ghetto of Barrington.  The other two were white--largely PWT (poor white trash) and Neanderthals (Appalachians) as we facetiously referred to them.  The ward had initially been written off as a loss for McCarthy.</span></p> <p><span>The McCarthy operation is based on a network of storefronts, neighborhood headquarters, from which door-to-door canvassing is organized.  Most storefronts handle up to 50 precincts.  Ours, due to the nature of the ward, was to concentrate on only five.  It was just the kind of lost cause McCarthy volunteers like best.  The Negroes were solidly Kennedy; the whites were basically conservative, leaning toward Branigin and Nixon.</span></p> <p><span>The Barrington project most closely resembles World War Two army housing.  It is not an urban ghetto like Roxbury, but neither does it have the suburban appearance of Watts.  There are few trees, but many open sewage ditches.  The air is warm and heavy like a Southern town.  Down at the Barrington Lounge, the local hotspot, you wouldn't be surprised to find Rod Steiger roughing up a few of the \"nigras.\"</span></p> <p><span>The people of Barrington, once you get them to talk, are discontented.  Their apartments are crammed in files of one or two level units.  Each contains two bedrooms and a living room which melts into a kitchen.  No room is larger than ten-by-ten.  The FHA is soon to take over the private project.  Monthly rents--already high--will be replaced by compulsory fiveyear leases.  It will be impossible to raise a growing family in any of the available units.</span></p> <p><span>But the blacks are generally passive.  The local chapters of SCLC and CORE have little practical structure.  There is no black power movement.  Most of the local Negro leaders endorsed McCarthy, with little noticeable effect on their people.  The Negroes of Barrington have been intimidated for years.  They don't want to risk what they do have.  Even McCarthy's proposed guaranteed annual income through a negative income tax was suspect.  The people of Barrington work for what they get.  They resent it--silently.</span></p> <p><span>Our storefront was located in one of the housing units.  Our permanent staff had become part of the community.  In three days, we visited every family in the ward, many of them twice.  In three weeks, the staff car had logged 1700 miles criss-crossing the area.  One by one, we hoped we were prying votes away from the other Democratic contenders.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>Kennedy-Kennedy</i></b></span></p> <p><span>\"Hey, man, here's what he looks like!\"  The kids, especially the younger teenagers, would have his picture.  A dedicated head on white cardboard emitting all the warmth of a high school graduation photo.  Whenever one of our cars was parked for a few moments, it would be plastered with his bumper stickers.  \"Man, we don't none o' that <i>McCarty.</i>  We want Kennedy--Kennedy!\"</span></p> <p><span>Who is this man, Kennedy-Kennedy?  For the Barrington Negro, he is a great white god in the guise of a handsome young man who has somehow transcended his whiteness.  He is the man, they tell you, who spent his time during the Kennedy administration pleading for the Negro through the South.  He has given tremendous amounts of money--10 percent of his worth, one lady claimed--to SCLC.  He talks nice, he cares.  He reminds some of them of his late brother.  For others, he is quite literally John Kennedy.</span></p> <p><span>You can't knock a god, though we tried.  We knew the people trusted us as much as they trusted any white man.  We took part in their activities.  One night we went to a fair in School 64--the Harriet Beecher Stowe School.  Sunday morning, we went to one of the local Baptist churches.  The neighbors would occasionally cook something for us--fried fish, perhaps, or a cake.  The smaller kids adopted us and conducted guerrilla forays in the name of McCarthy.  But they were our only converts.</span></p> <p><span><b>S</b>OMEHOW, McCarthy remained a distant, dangerous politician to the community.  He hadn't visited the McCarthy in each precinct.  By noon, we knew only a handful were registered voters.  In one precinct, the vote ran:  Branigin, 25; McCarthy, 27; area, as Kennedy had.  It probably would have made much difference.  Paul Newman had visited Barrington and received a cool reception.  The people couldn't be talked out of Kennedy.  Their reasons for voting for him had hardened.  Some left he would clean up the garbage.  One woman preferred McCarthy, but said she would vote for Bobby because he \"quivers my liver.\"  That's charisma, man.</span></p> <p><span>The election results were not surprising.  We had estimated that there were about 50 people leaning toward Kennedy, 550.  In the white areas, the vote was distributed much more equally.  But Indianapolis is 45 per cent Negro.  Kennedy captured the city.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>The Caucus Race</i></b></span></p> <p><span>Senator McCarthy denied it, but the fact remained that all the candidates had been running a caucus race.  And now they would all demand the prize.  It was another inconclusive primary.</span></p> <p><span>Since the polls had closed at seven, the volunteers had been dragging back into headquarters.  McCarthy Headquarters occupied the first two floors of the Claypool Hotel; the remaining floors had been gutted by fire a few months earlier.  Tuesday night, it was filled with exhausted, slightly depressed volunteers.  A dixieland band only aggravated the prevailing tension.</span></p> <p><span>About ten, the Senator arrived.  He was excited, but, characteristically, he tried to control a smile.  Most of the volunteers had forced their way into the press room, where he was to make his first statement.  The room was crowded, hot.  The crowd became jubilant.  We were still two points ahead of Branigin.  \"I am not here to dismiss the troops,\" the Senator began.</span></p> <p><span>The kids responded with cheers and victory signs.  Many tried to touch the Senator with all the abandon of a Kennedy crowd.  He worked his way through the room, shaking hands and quietly thanking us.</span></p> <p><span>It had not been a victory, true, but neither had it been a defeat.  McCarthy, even in an uncongenial state, still couldn't be beaten.  Some staff members were leaving that night for Nebraska.  Others would be going on to California the next day.  The staff room was jammed with volunteers asking for full-time staff applications.  Many had decided to screw school and stay with the campaign.  Others would get out to the Coast after exams.  And everyone promised to meet in Chicago.  The crusade was still snowballing; the entourage of idealistic college dropouts was growing.  Someone made a sign:  Robert Lowell for Secretary of State.  We were dreaming once again.</span></p> <p><span>The next day, a few of us were waiting at the airport trying to catch a flight back to Boston.  A flight through Cincinnati and Washington was about to leave.  We stood, un washed, bleary-eyed in the half-fare line.  Just before take-off, Larry O'Brien, ex-Postmaster General now masterminding Bobby's campaign, arrived.  We hissed.  He turned, glanced at our buttons, smiled.  We told him we would see him in California.  The Crusade had still to reach the Holy Land</span></p>"}

{"title": "Trouble in the Poor People's Campaign | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>WASHINGTON, D.C.--There is something about pluralism that leaves some people out.  The poor have been left out of American political and economic life mainly because they have never had the resources to play the game.</span></p> <p><span>It had always been the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s vision to build a strong pressure group out of the poor of the country, strong enough to compete with the interests that run the nation now.  His idea was to bring that rag-tag pressure group to Washington, to somehow \"pressure\" Congress into recognizing poverty as a problem and more important, into recognizing poor people as a political force.</span></p> <p><span>Behind the demands for 30 to 50 billion dollars in programs for the poor lies this purpose--to bring poor people into the system.  Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller called the Poor People's Campaign \"a kind of lobbying.\"</span></p> <p><span>It is lobbying for people who have never had a lobby.  It is an experiment and a discovery.  But so far, after a week and a half in West Potomac Park, it has also been a failure.  And it has failed for ancient reasons.  The campaign simply lacks the money, the leadership, and the talent to play the game, and few people in Washington are going to help it play.</span></p> <p><span>It is unfortunate that no one wants to help, because the Rev. Ralph David Abernathy (a man as dry and heavy as his name) has been saying over and over that the campaign is some sort of last chance before something bad happens.  And he is right.  It is the first and the last chance for the poor to enter the market, and if they are kept out this spring, they will probably reject that market entirely.  Right now, the campaign is in chaos.</span></p> <p><span><b>No Food</b></span></p> <p><span>Late last week, Southern Christian Leadership Conference staff members revealed that the campaign was in serious financial trouble.  It lacked food and adequate housing for the people already in Washington and the leaders were issuing holding orders for those already on the road.</span></p> <p><span>SCLC needs no less than $3 million to survive through the middle of June.  Right now, the only hope for getting this money is a massive march on Memorial Day that may bring hundreds of thousands of people (and dollars) into Washington to support the campaign.</span></p> <p><span>Leadership is a definite problem too.  Abernathy has been on the road almost constantly since the campaign reached Washington.  In charge at Resurrection City is the Rev. James Bevel, a bright man, but hardly an inspiring leader.</span></p> <p><span>While Abernathy was calming congressional sympathizers last Wednesday, Bevel, in contrast, was giving reporters a hard line at a press conference.  Abernathy himself has been vacillating.  No one knows whether he is \"hard\" or \"soft.\"  He seems to change his mind daily.</span></p> <p><span>The original tactic of keeping demands vague has caused trouble in the ranks.  The poor people at Resurrection City have very little idea what their leaders are after, and they are left with a feeling of confusion and a lack of direction.  Many came to Washington to escape poverty at home.  \"I came here because things are better,\" a woman from Lebanon, Miss., told me.  Many expect to stay permanently.  But so far, life in the plywood A-frame shelters has hardly been uplifting--materially or spiritually.  It is uncomfortable and boring.  People are going home.  The Washington <i>Star</i> said that 50 had left by the fourth day.</span></p> <p><span><b>Dropping By</b></span></p> <p><span>If there is inspiration, it comes in small doses.  The predominant theme is \"dropping by to see how things are going.\"  So far the players have included:  Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey, Stokely Carmichael, Sen. Charles Percy (R-Ill.), and New York Mayor John Lindsay.  The personality types tour the camp, shake hands, smile broadly, and leave.  That's all.</span></p> <p><span>The reaction of Congress to the campaign has been pretty much as expected.  Congress does not like \"blackmail,\" and that phrase is loaded with racial overtones.</span></p> <p><span>I.F. Stone wrote last week, \"To see the Poor People's March on Washington in perspective, remember that the rich have been marching on Washington ever since the beginning of the Republic. . . . They don't have to put up in shanties.  The object is the same but few respectable people are untactful enough to call it handouts.\"</span></p> <p><span>What the campaign is trying to do is exert the same kind of pressure on Congress as special interests have been exerting for nearly 200 years.  If that is blackmail, then the Congress ought to be used to it.</span></p> <p><span>The difference, of course, is that there is latent in the Poor People's demands, a threat of violence.  But to associate the violence and the campaign is absurd.  There will be violence this summer anyway; there will surely be blood and looting.  The campaign was conceived as a way to provide a possible alternative to that violence, if only by making efficient political use of the threat of violence.</span></p> <p><span><b>Hardly Radical</b></span></p> <p><span>The campaign is hardly revolutionary.  In fact, it is so un-revolutionary as to be almost farcical.  At a time when it can be clearly seen that the American system has failed 20 per cent of the people of this country, the poor people still want to get into that system.</span></p> <p><span>V.O. Key writes in <i>Politics, Parties, and Pressure Groups,</i> \"To carve out a place for itself in the politico-social order, a new group may have to fight for reorientation of many of the values of the order.\"  To a surprising degree, the Poor People's Campaign is <i>not</i> fighting for this reorientation.</span></p> <p><span>The programs that SCLC describes as \"goals\" are hardly radical.  Its idea of guaranteed income is only for \"those either too young, too old, or too handicapped to work.\"  They merely want welfare spruced up, more efficient.  Their demands for jobs have already been proposed by the Johnson Administration.  The Poor People's Campaign, then, is a struggle to get <i>in,</i> a struggle to educate, not a struggle to force America to accept a radically new kind of society.</span></p> <p><span>That Congress misunderstands the campaign is not at all surprising.  Congress has always had a Neanderthal brain in matters of social change.  But the campaign is lacking in popular support also.  The liberal money that normally backs adventures like this one is going to Kennedy and McCarthy; an election year is a bad time for a Poor People's Campaign.</span></p> <p><span>More than that, people with contacts in Washington can sense the mood of that city well--it is vicious.  Washington in May--in any other year a beautiful place for a campaign--is in 1968 angry and gloomy and brutal.</span></p> <p><span>Washington is not only a nation's capital, it is coincidentally a city--a city that had a riot last month, and since that riot a crime wave.  A few recent examples of Washington's mood include:</span></p> <p><span>* A bus driver was murdered in a holdup Friday, touching off a short strike.  Drivers first demanded a policeman on every bus, now may settle for curtailment of all service after 10 p.m. Bus robberies are double last year's pace.</span></p> <p><span>* A group of businessmen, burned out in the April riot, have hired nationally prominent attorney Edward Bennett Williams, to look into the possibility of suing the city for damages.  Police did not, fire at looters, and troops were not brought in soon enough--the same old stuff.</span></p> <p><span>* Park and Shop, Inc., representing the most powerful of the District's business interests, took out a full-page advertisement in the newspapers demanding more protection from the city and asking that \"troops be placed on duty to supplement the policy forces prior to and during\" the campaign.</span></p> <p><span>* The House District Committee last week called Washington Public Safety Director Patrick V. Murphy on the carpet and demanded to know why police would not shoot rioters.</span></p> <p><span>* Since the riot, Washington restaurants have lost $40 million in business.  Tourism, the District's staple, has taken a plunge.  After dark the downtown streets are nearly empty.</span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile, a progressive-minded but basically impotent city government has issued a 44-page report on the April riot, calling for many of the programs suggested in the Kerner Report and emphasizing more local control of businesses in the ghetto.  But the city government appears to be in a less powerful position than the interests that have always run Washington (Park and Shop and friends) through the Congressional committees.</span></p> <p><span>Beyond that, the city is not ready for reconciliation, much less progress.  It is above all scared and vicious.  That is not a good environment for any kind of campaign.  It is a horrible environment for a disorganized campaign that is not sure where it is going.</span></p> <p><span>It is sad that no one recognizes that this campaign is a last chance, that soon poor people will no longer want to get in.  They will be fed up with that.  It is sad that they are not getting help and it is sad that Congress misunderstands them and the city of Washington hates and fears them.</span></p> <p><span>But listen to who they are if you wonder what will happen next.  A black man testifying at the City Council hearings after the April riot said it:  \"This is my feeling.  I am frustrated, I am angry, and I am mad.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Students from New England to Berkeley Discover Their Own Universities, and Find | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>HIS WAS the year that students brought the war back home to the campus.  In a swirling mass of identities, we became Vietcong and then blacks and then students again.  And it happened all over--not just at Berkeley and Harvard, but at Ohio University and the University of Hawaii.  Suddenly, students became activists.  They <i>did</i> things.  They took over buildings and held deans captive; they shut down universities and they bled.</span></p> <p><span>The issue exploded from the war (which you could criticize from the sidelines) to the whole society (which you couldn't).  Suddenly, the target became your home, the place that coddled and sheltered you and encouraged you.  Suddenly, the target became the university.</span></p> <p><span>The reasons that the university became the target are not too hard to see.  There was a rational progression to it all.  The Dow sit-ins of the fall protested first the corporation's manufacture of napalm, and then the university's sanction of it by allowing Dow to use university facilities to recruit future napalm-makers.</span></p> <p><span>From there it was only a short hop to university \"complicity\" in the war:  the university was contributing to the war effort by investing in armaments and by doing war research for the government.</span></p> <p><span>Finally, the university was seen as a mirocosm of society, and there was Columbia.  As SDS founder and Columbia Outside Agitator Tom Hayden wrote:</span></p> <p><span><b>Columbia's problem is the American problem in miniature--the inability to provide answers to widespread social needs and the use of the military to' protect the authorities against the people.</b></span></p> <p><span><b>I.</b></span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>T WAS a long road to travel in a year.  But the thing called the Establishment has always had a death wish, and it helped out nicely.  The big ugly war pervaded all American institutions, including the university.  The \"institutionalized hypocrisy\" that Kenneth Keniston says American youth hates is right here, right in front of us.</span></p> <p><span>Academic freedom, we found, is so much bunk, just as \"outside\" freedom is so much bunk.  The university, with its enormous government and business connections, is part of the whole rotten mess.</span></p> <p><span>The year after American students discovered America, they discovered their own universities.  They looked at the university power structure and found out that it was undemocratic.  They looked at the policy-making boards of the university and found them loaded with businessmen and corporation lawyers.  They looked at their professors and found them doing research for the government.  The war caused it, and the recognition was quite a shock.</span></p> <p><span>Now, all of a sudden, right away, students want all this changed.  What they are demanding is a new university.  Hayden writes:</span></p> <p><span><b>[Students at Columbia] did not even want to be included in the decision-making circles of the military-industrial complex that runs Columbia:  they want to be included only if their inclusion is a step toward transforming the university.  They want a new and independent university standing against the mainstream of society, or they want no university at all.</b></span></p> <p><span>Richard T. Gill, Master of Leverett House, talked about Columbia last month on a WGBH-TV panel.  His position is much the same as other academics.  He argued that the university should not be the target of student attacks because the university is the American institution <i>most</i> capable of promoting social change.</span></p> <p><span>To the activist, that is the very reason that it should be attacked.  If in a time of crisis the university cannot forcefully demand social change, then who can?  To the student activist, the university is a wishy-washy, impotent liberal--a despicable character.</span></p> <p><span>Keniston talks in his new book, <i>Young Radicals,</i> about how most radicals have an image of their father that is split into two parts:</span></p> <p><span><b>On the one hand, the father was portrayed as highly ethical, intellectually strong, principled, honest, politically involved, and idealistic.  But on the other hand, this same father in other contexts was seen as unsuccessful, acquiescent, weak, or inadequate.</b></span></p> <p><span>The university is seen in this split image also.  In an interview I had early this spring with a top Harvard administration official, he talked about how healthy and constructive activism is.  Yet, at the same time, he argued that students should not resist the draft because it is not worth it.  \"It will ruin the rest of their lives,\" he said.  \"This will pass.  Harvard students have always been able to cope with outside pressures well.  They can find ways out.\"  (And they have too.  They see their friendly local doctor or shrink.)</span></p> <p><span>It is this kind of hypocrisy that disgusts students.  The university tells them to be honest and moral, but, like the radical's father, it is too weak and inadequate to put its beliefs into action--it encourages students to do the same.</span></p> <p><span>The university has also become the target of activist students because it is where the student lives.  In part, the reaction is one of guilt, like the black student who finds it hard to justify being in college while his people are in bondage.</span></p> <p><span>The white activist has a similar problem.  There is the world, and you are here.  What can you do?  The first way out is to discover that the world is here too, right here in the university.</span></p> <p><span><b>II.</b></span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE DISCOVERY of the university opens up new worlds.  There is a vast wealth of conspiracy to be uncovered, large numbers of liberal professors to humiliate, and it is not lonely at all.  It is fun.  It is great fun to manipulate the Establishment, to push it around, to outsmart it.  It is what David Riesman calls \"mischief\" with a consciousness of the absurd always there.</span></p> <p><span>Before, at a university, the pressures to conform meant a lack of commitment.  What was cool was to be critical of things from the sidelines.  Joining political organizations was not cool.  It was better to talk and sneer.  But now, in a new milieu, it is exciting to act.  It is romantic and it is fun.</span></p> <p><span>Commitment does not have to mean ideological rigidity.  All commitment is <i>doing.</i>  It is existential, as Simon James (a pseudonym for a Columbia demonstrator) shows in a feature that appeared last month in the CRIMSON and NEW YORK magazine.  He writes down his thoughts as he sits-in at President Grayson Kirk's office:</span></p> <p><span><b>I am not having good times here.  I do not know many people who are here, and I have doubts about why they are here.  Worse, I have doubts about why I am here.  (Note the frequency of the word 'here.'  The place I am is the salient characteristic of my situation.)  It's possible that I'm here to be cool or to meet people or to meet girls (as distinct from people) or to get out of crew or to be arrested.</b></span></p> <p><span><b>Of course the possibility exists that I am here to precipitate some change at the university.  I am willing to accept the latter as true, or rather, I am willing, even anxious, not to think about it any more.  If you think too much on the second tier (think about why you are thinking what you think) you can be paralyzed. . . .</b></span></p> <p><span><b>Certainly it isn't conscionable, to hold [Dean Henry] Coleman captive.  But attention is being gotten.  Steps will be taken in one direction or another.  The polls will fluctuate and the market will quiver.  Or being here is the cause of an effect.  We're trying to make it Good; I don't know what else to say or do.  That is, I have no further statement to make at this time, gentlemen.</b></span></p> <p><span>There is something that makes us want the market to quiver and the polls to fluctuate.  That is why we <i>do</i> things.  All Simon James knows is that he wants to make it Good.  That is a good thing to know.  Don't ask him how he would remake the university.  He is honest and he is doing and he wants it Good and he recognizes that things are rotten and that is enough.</span></p> <p><span>Simon James is not really so new.  The report of the Muscatine Committee at Berkeley two years ago describes him fairly well, even though the committee's understanding of the depth of his feeling is hopelessly inadequate:</span></p> <p><span><b>There is much youthful impatience in the search for instantaneous remedies to public and private ills.  The unconventional student is inordinately sure that his own picture of the world is the correct one.  He lacks the perspective necessary for self-criticism and for an appreciation of his opponent's position.  Of course, there are also some who enjoy the notoriety and power offered by leadership of protest movements.</b></span></p> <p><span>Here we are with all this youthful impatience.  The faculty and administration, says the Muscatine Report, \"are more willing to tolerate the evils of the world, believing they can be reduced but never entirely eliminated.\"  And so we do not understand each other, and there is conflict.</span></p> <p><span>The difference between Berkeley and Columbia is quantity not quality.  The feelings are the same, but this year more people have them, and they are deeper.  The reason for this is the self-destructive bent of Establishment liberalism.  Throughout the year, the government and the universities have managed to \"radicalize\" large numbers of students, to turn cool liberals into hot radicals.</span></p> <p><span><b>III.</b></span></p> <p><span><b>R</b>ADICALIZING people has been one of the major tasks of SDS and other activist organizations for a long time.  But SDS has never been able to radicalize people by what <i>it</i> does.  Instead, its task has been to produce confrontations, then let the authorities do the work.</span></p> <p><span>A radicalizing experience is often something like getting your head bashed in by cops, or watching your friends get their heads bashed in by cops.  Or else it can be watching something fail, as Harvard's Student-Faculty Advisory Council has failed.</span></p> <p><span>Keniston explained radicalization in terms of coming face-to-face with the evils of society:</span></p> <p><span><b>Even more than most young middle-class Americans, these young men and women [radicals], while they had \"done the reading,\" were not psychologically prepared for a personal and concrete confrontation with injustice, social repression and discrimination.</b></span></p> <p><span>Coupled with the \"shock of confrontation\"--disproportionately strong for these students from privileged families--is the vision of failure these students see in the political system.  The social injustice, the reaction in rioting that they see around them makes them reject the customary liberal belief that institutions already exist that can relieve the inequities.  They have been around too long.  Keniston writes:</span></p> <p><span><b>What is most impressive is not their secret motivation to have the System fail, but naive hope that it would succeed, and the extent of their depression and disillusion when their early reformist hopes were frustrated.</b></span></p> <p><span>As more students are radicalized by these confrontations, the polarization gets greater.  The liberals, who say that things are bad but can be corrected, become lumped together with the racists and militarists who are actively making things bad.  This year, more than anything else, we have seen a crisis for the liberals--the dispassionate sideliners who have been sneering and talking but not doing.  I wrote in a Crimson article last October:</span></p> <p><span><b>For those who were listening, listening to the war get worse and to the repression of demonstrations get more brutal, the time for the choice was zooming in very fast.  Sitting on the sidelines, being cool-liberal and dispassionate was becoming irrelevant.  The theme that the Washington demonstrators harped on was:  if you're not with us, you're against us.</b></span></p> <p><span><b>And how frustrating it is to try to convince them that you are with them!  Words, apparently, are not good enough any more.</b></span></p> <p><span>That was October.  Since then, the pressures of the war have gotten worse (drafting graduate students), and the repression of demonstrations has gotten more brutal (the bloody raid on Columbia).  More people have gotten radicalized.</span></p> <p><span><b>IV.</b></span></p> <p><span>The best way to look at this phenomenon of radicalization is to look at the history of student activism on university campuses this year.  The focus will be on the events of October, 1967, and April, 1968, when outside events--the work of the self-destructive Establishment--managed to turn hordes of cool liberals into hot radicals and managed to build a movement.</span></p> <p><span>The war dominated everything.  And the October action began with massive protests against the war--draft-card turn-ins that were supposed to symbolize a new direction for the anti-war movement, \"from dissent to resistence.\"</span></p> <p><span>On October 16, turn-ins were organized across the country to begin an anti-war, anti-draft week that would culminate in a march on the Pentagon \"to confront the warmakers.\"  In Boston, 237 men, including 23 Harvard students, burned or turned in their cards.  In New York, Baton Rogue, and San Francisco the scene was the same.  In Oakland, California, all through the week, anti-war demonstrators trying to march on the induction center there battled police, and the New York Times showed you the blood on the front page.</span></p> <p><span>These Octobrists were the conscience of the movement that would develop during the year.  On Friday, October 20, they presented their 984 cards to the Justice Department.  Since then, a Selective Service memorandum has called for them to be treated as delinquents, and many are facing five-year jail terms.</span></p> <p><span>If there was one day, a single day that can be described as a turning point in the move toward resistence, it was Saturday.  The place (Simon James's \"salient characteristic\") was the Pentagon.</span></p> <p><span>\"For the first time in my life, I was standing on one side and my government was standing on the other,\" said one participant.  \"We finally found out what it was like to be Vietcong,\" said another.  Soldiers were coming at you with gas masks on and sheathed bayonets drawn.  Tear gas canisters exploded, and people were being dragged off for \"transgressing a police line,\" like Norman Mailer did.</span></p> <p><span>At the Pentagon, hundreds of U.S. Marshals and thousands of troops faced 40,000 demonstrators.  That was all it was--a raw, bitter confrontation.  Two lines facing each other, looking at each other.  There were sudden rushes into the line of troops drawn around the building--almost a giant game of capture the flag.  In the end 600 were arrested.</span></p> <p><span>And there was blood, too.  The repression came, and for the first time in their lives, middle-class college students were clubbed and gassed by police and soldiers.  It was Keniston's \"confrontation with evil,\" the thing that radicalizes you.  That night, a few thousand sat on the steps of the Pentagon with troops smashing them with rifle butts, but no one reported it.</span></p> <p><span>In the morning, they came home to school to tell their friends about it.  At a rally in the Yard, once one-time cool-liberals were talking in hot-radical tones about what had happened, and the word brought a reaction.</span></p> <p><span>The first place it happened was Princeton, an unlikely place.  Amory Blaine would have been shocked to see 31 students arrested for blocking the entrance to a government-sponsored military research center on the university's campus--the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA).  IDA would later become a major university complicity issue at the University of Chicago and at Columbia.</span></p> <p><span>The people who go to Princeton today are quite different from those who went there five years ago.  And this situation is the same at other \"pace-setting\" schools.  A few years ago, a new dean of admissions at Princeton changed the school's public-to-private school graduate ratio from 40-60 to 60-40.  The new radicals there call themselves \"Dunham's Children\" after the admissions dean.  Upperclassmen were calling them \"lunchmeat\"--a favorite Princeton expression.  But the \"lunchies\" dominate Princeton now.  And a tiny but active SDS chapter has been organizing sit-ins all year.</span></p> <p><span>Princeton's effect on other campuses was strong.  Just as Midwestern types had once adopted the button-down shirt and the rep tie from the Ivy League, they now began to adopt the sit-in as life style.</span></p> <p><span>At Harvard the reaction to the Pentagon was the Dow sit-in.  Three hundred students held a Dow recruiter named Frederick Leavitt inside Malinckrodt M-102 for seven hours, then let him go.  As a result, 74 students were placed on probation and the Student-Faculty Advisory Council, a committee of the Faculty, was set up to look into recruiting and other things.</span></p> <p><span>The October demonstrations opened things up.  Students began to look into what their universities were doing.  They began to complain and criticize.  Something was building.</span></p> <p><span>In Cambridge, a \"failure of the system\" sort of radicalizing event happened when a referendum on the war was soundly defeated.  To quite a few hard-working students, including many that Keniston had interviewed months before, it was a stunning blow.  The \"channels\" that liberals had talked about were turning out to be ineffective channels.</span></p> <p><span><b>V.</b></span></p> <p><span>Then, on February 16, lightning struck.  In perhaps the single most important event of the year to the movement, the Selective Service decided to draft seniors and first-year graduate students in June.  The symbolic confrontation at the Pentagon was now a real one.  It was a shock that everyone knew was coming.</span></p> <p><span>Someone had thrown up a wall against the future, and suddenly 1968 was snatched away.  Suddenly it became June, and there you were with the war that you told everyone you hated.  And a government you never knew had decided your future for you.  That was lousy and undemocratic, and back in your mind you remembered that the same thing had happened to people in Vietnam and in America and all over the world.  And maybe it was an irrational reaction, but you hated your country for what it did and you didn't want to be a part of it.</span></p> <p><span>There were plans then for a summer in Chicago and all over.  Tom Wicker was saying that hundreds of thousands would resist.  Then General Hershey would not be able to get enough men, and maybe the war would end in that kind of glory.  The thousands of college seniors and grad students would be the raw material for a massive movement for social change in this country.</span></p> <p><span>Then came a hiatus, an interruption--Eugene McCarthy.  When we were all sure that it would be Johnson and Nixon in November with no one really caring, McCarthy showed up.  In March he nearly won New Hampshire.  And then, on the night before April Fool's Day, Johnson told us that he wouldn't run, that he would try for peace.  And suddenly, things fell to pieces.</span></p> <p><span>Peace, even a phony peace that will mean war for two more years and no real change in the policies that lead to war, peace is a beautiful thing.  And this country embraces it as a beautiful thing.  Students, like everyone else in America see war and peace as separate times and separate places.  There is nothing in between.  For a long time, it looked like this country was at peace.</span></p> <p><span>Then April came, and the next shock hit.  Martin Luther King was assassinated, and nothing was different after all.  Black students brought America back to the university, just as white radicals had brought the war to the university.</span></p> <p><span>There was a connection there, we all realized at once.  The war is America, and America is the university.  And suddenly the university became the battleground, in a comfortable, fun university-way.  From being students we had gone to become Vietcong at the Pentagon, then to become blacks<jtp>15<c><r>Ronald H.

{"title": "RFK Meant Electoral Hope to Dispossessed | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Mr. Kennedy came over to Brooklyn a lot.  I must have spoken to him four, maybe five times.  He just would come to the park and walk around and talk to us--about school, our jobs, anything.  I last saw him in late April.  He seemed tired but we talked a bit.  Mr. Kennedy was the only politician I knew.  Those other guys--Nixon, McCarthy, Rockefeller, Humphrey--I don't know them from nothing. --a black youth from Bedford-Stuyvesant outside St. Patrick's Cathedral last week</span></p> <p><span>Kennedy was damn smart.  Most American leaders aren't.  When he came to South America he knew what was going on.  Hell, he knew more about student problems than some of the students did. \u00a0\u00a0--a Brazilian student at Harvard outside Lowell House this week</span></p> <p><span>The weeping hasn't stopped.  It probably won't for a number of years.  Robert F. Kennedy's most fervent supporters seem convinced that the events of the next four years--under a Nixon or a Humphrey--will only intensify the frustration and violence which have come to typify American political and social life in the last few years.  One Harvard professor said Monday night, \"It's time for another Long March to Yenan.\"</span></p> <p><span>Why this despair, this sense of resignation?  Part of the answer undoubtedly lies in Robert Kennedy's ineffable ability to make his cohorts--professors, lawyers, entertainers, sportsmen, and kids--feel he was not merely their boss or leader or public advocate, but their true friend.  Most of his professional associates soon became pals of one sort of another.  Tragedy, moralism, and fatalism seemed to give Kennedy a warmth and compassion his detractors denied him to the end.</span></p> <p><span>But the much-maligned James Michael Curley had this same ability to forge personal, emotional bonds with his aides and cohorts.  Shy, anxious Bobby Kennedy had something else:  his backers were certain that he alone could move to heal the racial, generational, and international crisis hobbling America.  As one Boston female lawyer back from the funeral said Sunday.  \"He had more imagination, guts, and heart than the rest.\"  According to his long-time adviser Adam Yarmolinsky, his constant refrain was \"What can I do about it?\"</span></p> <p><span>Robert Kennedy, then, made America's problems personal causes.  He baited white, suburban audiences throughout the country this spring with tales of life in the ghetto and on the Indian reservations.  He told Oregon's hunters that easy access to guns was immoral.  His personality, his bristling hope, and his eclecticism were his politics.</span></p> <p><span>So far as his advisers were concerned, this was Robert Kennedy's long suit.  Despite the obvious difficulties posed by his bluntness and verbal outrage, Kennedy's message had a purpose:  to console and reassure America's \"outs\"--bitter blacks, exploited farm workers, and war-weary students.  These were the groups which were falling out and had to be pulled back in.  This is why Kennedy saw himself as the candidate of reconciliation.  Given the circumstances, it didn't seem as important if the groups which fought him--generally the wealthier elements, hidebound Republicans, and segregationists--were a little miffed.  Besides, it was quite possible that a Kennedy Administration could take care of opponents by giving them economic stability and fewer riots and student take-overs.  A dream, but why not?</span></p> <p><span>Bob Kennedy had a good deal of trouble getting his dreams across.  Most of the nation's newspapers seemed more anxious to catch his occasional slips, to dwell on his so-called \"ruthlessness,\" than to explain--or even just to analyze--the thrust of his campaign.  In their zeal to discuss Joe McCarthy and wiretapping, editorial writers somehow forgot that Bob Kennedy defended the right of Americans to send material aid to North Vietnam and fought bills to cut back the Supreme Court's landmark criminal procedure decisions.  They refused to admit that the Bob Kennedy who relentlessly exposed the costs of labor racketeering was the same man who assaulted apartheid on it's home territory.  They seemed to forget that the drive for a nuclear non-proliferation treaty began only after Kennedy publicly raised the issue in a 1965 Senate speech.  They didn't see that Kennedy meant as much to the frenzied crowds as they did to him.  They refused to take his humor for its own sake, but insisted it was his sly reaction to the \"ruthlessness\" tag.</span></p> <p><span>Though Kennedy's supporters felt he was getting a raw deal, they felt less badly about it by the end of the California primary.  It finally appeared that John Kennedy's slight, shy brother had carved out a winning campaign style and more important, one that was his own.  Few rhetorical flourishes, high-minded slogans; more caustic straight talk and grueling face-to-face contact.  Kennedy gave the nation, as his press secretary Frank Mankiewicz, said, the rare belief that he was a politician who would do what he said, that his \"campaign promises\" were promises.</span></p> <p><span>There is no way of telling, of course, whether Bob Kennedy would have made the White House on this run.  A summer of riots, the impasse in Paris, and rising Vietnam casualty rates could well have eroded Vice President Humphrey's delegate lead.  And much of Senator McCarthy's liberal, affluent support might have resigned itself to the former Attorney General.  Yet the importance of the Kennedy campaign--or, indeed, the post-1963 Kennedy career--doesn't lie merely in what it might have been.  Grief-stricken Kennedy backers should take some solace in a contribution Kennedy has made to the American political culture which in time may overshadow the importance of the Cuban missile crisis or even Vietnam.</span></p> <p><span>Robert Kennedy's curious ability--and desire--to stir the enthusiasm of black people, young whites, and other traditionally dispossessed groups may very well accelerate radical changes</span></p> <p><span><b>Photos</b></span></p> <p><span>The photographs of Robert F. Kennedy in California were taken by Didi Pei '68, who in his junior year was photo chairman of the Harvard Year-book, and who recently was working as a Kennedy campaign staff photographer in California.  Some of the pictures were taken on the day Kennedy was shot. in America's procrustean political mechanisms.  While Kennedy assured such blocs he would represent them, he also tried to give them a sense that their own participation, wholly apart from his own future, would in time yield results.  The upshot of his pitch was a multiple victory:  alienated blacks and poor whites voted en masse in Indiana and California, clinched Kennedy wins, and got a brief feeling that their votes actually meant something.</span></p> <p><span>In short, poor white laborers, Mexican-Americans, and blacks were given a sense of possibility about Ameri-politics political bosses heretofore denied them.  It remains to be seen whether the dispossessed will form their own local political organizations, but Kennedy has finally given them electoral, and maybe social, hope.</span></p> <p><span>Richard E. Neustadt has called this \"urban populism.\"  To the extent that it appeared this spring, this movement is probably one of the main reasons Kennedy met such modest success snaring delegates in northern industrial, non-primary states.  Oldstyle political leaders not only feared the possibility of a President dealing actively with upstart urban alignments; they were also chary of Kennedy's rather pronounced enthusiasm for community action projects and increased private investment in ghetto self-development.  Much of what Kennedy said was also directly threatening to rural political leaders who frequently rely on minimal voter participation.</span></p> <p><span>But Kennedy's impact does not stop at the power shifts his campaign style encouraged.  He brought to the electorate the feeling that political life could be meaningful as well as exciting.  Campaigning against the \"politics of joy,\" he was the first American politician since his brother to bring a sense of gleeful buoyancy back to the hustings.  Kennedy's name and good looks aside, much of this happy frenzy was due to his audience's knowledge that only Kennedy gave sure promise of ending -- or at least transforming -- the dull pain emanating from the nation's capital these days.</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps this helps to explain the curious coalition Kennedy forged in Indiana--poor blacks and lower-income, frustrated whites who otherwise might have leaned to Governor Wallace.  Herein lies the sad paradox of Kennedy's truncated campaign:  the most bitterly opposed Presidential aspirant was somehow able to unite briefly America's two most mutually explosive groups.</span></p> <p><span>Kennedy's call was unfamiliar to most Americans.  The New York Senator asked for rapid political and economic change, law and order, a halt to war.  By the fatal end of his run he was keeping his appeal relatively free of recrimination.  His strongest words were reserved not for segregationists, economic malefactors, or regressive political bosses; he harpooned the national leaders of his own party.  Richard Nixon was no more than the butt of a few jokes.  More than \"poor-mouthing,\" Kennedy evoked a new sense of self-awareness and self-realization--more like Teddy Roosevelt than any 20th century Democratic President.  The promise of dignity and security he held out to his \"special constituency\" was matched by his attempt to teach the well-off the perils of smug self-isolation.</span></p> <p><span>Unlike his brother, who campaigned primarily for a refreshed national leadership, Bob Kennedy sought publicly to invigorate American political and social thought.  Like many Republicans, he questioned the efficacy of a burgeoning federal bureacracy.  In the same breath, though, he infuriated the G.O.P., insisting that renovated, upgraded state and local government would have to take up any slack.  His seemingly conservative outlook on federalism was shaped by a liberal goal--government-backed social and economic justice.</span></p> <p><span>It is too early to tell whether Kennedy's career, his campaign, and the impulses he stimulated will have an immediate effect on American political life.  On the national level, where his urgent voice and prod will be most sorely missed, the prognosis is tragically dim.  Almost as depressing, the nation has been cut off from perhaps its most educational sport--watching and listening to the noisest, most enterprising U.S. Senator since George Norris.</span></p> <p><span>Yet Robert Kennedy was really a good deal more than a healthy spectator sport, more than a major reformist influence in American society, more than a sympathetic, concerned friend, even more than what Jack Paar called \"the most beautiful man I ever knew.\"  In a tragic historical sense, Robert Kennedy was one of the few, and surely the most effective of America's political leaders who liberated themselves from the strangling moralisms of the 1950s.  Bob Kennedy got over Communist watching, shucked the blinders of Cold War interventionism, and found ghetto residents more enlightening Congressional witnesses than labor racketeers.  Sometime in the decade before his death, Bob Kennedy put the Red threat and the New York <i>Daily News</i> headlines in the back of his mind, took a long look at the American people and decided the needed help.  He may not have lived long enough to transmit to his countrymen the compassion and concern he discovered in himself.  Maybe that's why Yenan looks attractive.<c><r>C. C. Pei</r></c></span></p>"}

{"title": "Experts Score Report's Assumptions | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The Riot Report's severest critics argue that sloppy research leads the Commission to base its Report on many questionable assumptions.  Lending such assumptions the prestigious stamp of a Presidential Committee may in fact make violence more probable, they say.</span></p> <p><span>Thus, Edward C. Banfield, Henry Lee Shattuck Professor of Government, points out that the Report does not do an adequate job of proving that Negroes riot because they feel they are being mistreated rather than for other reasons.  (In a forthcoming book Banfield seeks to show that Negroes riot \"mainly for Fun and Profit\"--the title of the chapter dealing with urban disorders).  Treating the first theory as self-evident truth can become a rationale for more violence by inferring that Negroes have a perfect right, indeed an obligation to riot, Banfield says.</span></p> <p><span><b>Reinforce Feelings</b></span></p> <p><span>Another adverse consequence of the Report is that \"such incessant protestations of guilt are going to reinforce feelings among Negroes that they are helpless against the overwhelming prejudice that exists among whites,\" Banfield said.  He stresses that it is impossible to address whites without the Negro listening in and convincing him of the importance of racial factors.</span></p> <p><span>James Q. Wilson, associate professor of Government, adds other reasons for criticising the Report.  Stressing white guilt may lead many to shrug off the Report as did presidential candidate Richard M. Nixon.  By failing to make it clear that the government does not condone violence, Wilson believes the Report will encourage whites to take the law in their own hands in order to protect themselves.  In proof, he points to the many white suburbanites now stockpiling weapons and learning to shoot.</span></p> <p><span>Secondly, the Report should have gone on to make very clear recommendtions for action, Wilson says.  To be effective it should have listed a very limited number of programs.  As it is, the Report makes several suggestions but does not set up any system of priorities.  Such tactics, Wilson added, can only dilute whatever effect it could otherwiise have hoped for.</span></p> <p><span>There is sharp disagreement among Harvard's urbanologists on this last point.  The final report had a strong impact, because the composition of the Commission made it look \"safe\" \"Establishment people, businessmen, a police chief, Republicans,\" one Harvard commentator described the Commissioners.</span></p> <p><span>Supporters point to the extended publicity with which the report was received.  Several papers have run ths summary, now being serialized on the editorial pages of the <b>Boston Globe</b> and more than one million paperback copies have been sold commercially.  They point to the Senate, which after two unsuccessful attempts passed the Open Housing bill 71 to 20, immediately after the Commission released the Report.</span></p> <p><span>More action it is agreed, is to be expected on the local than on the national level, mostly notably in New York where Lindsay has vowed to champion the Report.  Whether or not the Report is a step towards curing the \"white man's sickness' 'and whether it will help prevent more violence are open questions, and nowhere more so than at Harvard</span></p>"}

You were on vacation -- in Bermuda or Florida or New York or Ohio.  And you were watching television that night, never really expecting anything.  Or you heard about it when the sun brought you a newspaper the next morning.</i></span></p> <p><span><b>R</b>EMEMBER the war?  The war is over.  And for all of us, at Harvard and in Baltimore and all over the world, these are the worst of times.</span></p> <p><span>Let me remind you.  It was a tough war, but we won.  On the last day of last month, the night before April Fool's Day, the President of the United States said that he had just about had enough.  He said that he would not run for President again and he said that he would try to make peace in Vietnam.  Whatever pushed him to that decision--the Vietcong or the anti-war people or a bad heart--it was over.  And in Cambridge they snake-danced in the streets.</span></p> <p><span>But even though everyone is talking peace and the stock market loves it and Averell Harriman is whispering and they are trying to find somewhere to talk and Irving Howe is happy, the war is not over--it is not anywhere near over.  It is over in the hearts of our countrymen but not over in Vietnam.  It will surely go on for at least two more years, and the situation at home will be much the same as it is over there:  no one will want to take a chance on getting wounded or killed on the day before the armistice.</span></p> <p><span>Since April Fool's Day, the anti-war movement has been running out of gas.  Something called the \"Academic Day of Conscience\" April 15 was an utter flop--only 70 students showed up at Memorial Church for the ceremonies.  Only six per cent of the Harvard Faculty could be persuaded to sign a moderately-worded statement backing draft resisters in an o so legal way.  And at the latest Boston draft card turn-in, only 20 people turned-in.</span></p> <p><span>That great wave of massive anti-war feeling that was washing over the country only two months ago has gone back to sea now.  And it has left behind calm little peaceful puddles on the beach.  People stand over the puddles, look at their reflections in the water and love it.  Peace is so wonderful.  It makes you forget about war.</span></p> <p><span>But this year's senior class cannot forget about war--and neither can the junior class, for the war certainly will not be over by then either.  They will all be gobbled up.  Draft quotas are soaring.  The seniors will not have a strong draft union behind them, backing them up, because (I must remind you) the war is over.  So agonize, everyone, and go join OCS and ROTC and VISTA and PC and all those other capital letters.  And those of you who still won't go, you will be hustled off to jail.  Only no one will listen to you now.  You are alone now.  Everyone is listening to the false poets of peace and looking at themselves in the puddles.  Everyone is listening to Eugene McCarthy.</span></p> <p><span><b>L</b>ONG ago there were dreams of a summer in Chicago and all over.  Tom Wicker was saying that hundreds of thousands would resist.  General Hershey would not be able to get enough men, and maybe the war would end in that kind of glory.  All of those thousands of college seniors and graduate students would build a strong movement for social change in this country.</span></p> <p><span>But that will never happen now, because Gene McCarthy gave us hope, and because the war is over.  After New Hampshire (and before too) McCarthy was drawing off the strength of the anti-war movement.  He was taking the money that would have gone to support resisters, taking the works and days of hands that would have built a movement.</span></p> <p><span>That is all too bad, you say.  Gene McCarthy, you say, is a hero and he will end the war.  But there are two problems:  first, the war is over now, as over as Gene McCarthy could ever have hoped it would be, and second, Gene McCarthy is a United States Senator.  He lives by the Senate's rules.  He has his own chosen interests--drugs and oil, they say.  And he has not introduced one major piece of legislation for social change in this country since he has been in office.  But, you say, he was there at the right time, when his country needed him.  Really, he was a few years late.  He remembered Tonkin a few years late.  There is New Hampshire, Gene McCarthy said, and I am here before anyone else, except maybe the anti-war movement.</span></p> <p><span>And he told you to shave and to cut your hair and to ring doorbells and to listen to him.  And you listened to him, and he was all gray hair and a gray suit and you loved him.  The <i>Times</i> said it--When things looked worst, he brought you back into the system.  Wonderful.</span></p> <p><span>The anti-war movement is dying now because of its successes.  John Lindsay will speak tomorrow at a big peace parade in New York, and for some that is a bit too much.  Even Hubert Humphrey is sounding puddle-peaceful.  We are being lulled to sleep by all of this.</span></p> <p><span><i>Long ago we marched to Washington and the Pentagon with Norman Mailer and Dr. Spock.  And there was blood on our heads.  And we sat.  up all night on the steps.  And we were alone.  And long ago we sat down in Mallinckrodt Hall and held a little old man prisoner for hours and they put us on probation to please the Boston</i> Globe.  <i>That was so long ago.</i></span></p> <p><span><b>M</b>EANWHILE, in the world, the next thing is black revolution.  And the next revolutionaries want nothing to do with the mostly-white anti-war movement.  On the Monday after Martin Luther King was shot, about a hundred students, nearly all of them white, listened on the steps of Memorial Church as the men of the Resistance tried so hard to link up the black uprising and the anti-war movement.  Hillary Putnam said that the philosophies of the two were really the same.  And Howard Zinn said that the Resistance had long fought racism in America.  But everyone was straining and straining.</span></p> <p><span>Then, the next day, on those same steps, the blacks held their own service to King.  And it was clear that the blacks did not want the Resistance, or any other whites.  That unsuccessful draft card turn-in was supposed to be in honor of King, and it was pathetic.  The same day on the Boston Common--with Kevin White and Cardinal Cushing getting into the act like Eugene McCarthy and Robert Kennedy and Hubert Humphrey--everyone was passing out leaf-lets.  End the War.  End Racism.  End Racism and the War.  No one recognizes it, but the blacks do not want the whites.  It is too late now for that.  And the movement is dying.</span></p> <p><span>Where are we now?  For one thing, we are all over and nowhere.  We are with McCarthy and we are alone.  We are about to be drafted and we are alone.  We are with everyone now, with John Lindsay and the thing called Establishment, and we are alone.</span></p> <p><span>It is only when more than a few thousand activists realize that they are alone that this thing will work again.  Since February and the days when Hershey told us we all had to go, only one thing has changed--we have been successful.  Everyone wants to be on our side, really to put us on their side.  We are being sucked up into the womb again, back to where we came from, safe and sound.  But don't let them fool us:  we are alone.  And until we realize it, these will remain the worst of times, even though the war is over.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Humphrey's Quest for the Presidency Suggests New Democratic Alignments | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Vice President Humphrey's formal entrance Saturday into the Presidential campaign suggested that the old ethnic and regional differences which once plagued the Democratic Party have been replaced by an avant garde form of divisiveness.</span></p> <p><span>Humphrey's announcement seems to have accomplished the once-impossible--it united the wildly disparate interests of John Connally of Texas, George Meany of the AFL-CIO, and Clarence Mitchell of the NAACP.  In other words, leaders of Democratic interest groups have reached something of a consensus.</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately, Humphrey has no guarantee that the followers will tag along with the leaders.  In fact, conservative Southerners, union members, and black Americans of all classes--to take three blocs--are likely to split their vote this year without regard to the positions staked out by their leaders.  More important, perhaps, it is unclear that the so-called leaders Humphrey has rallied to his banner can be considered political powers any more.</span></p> <p><span>Johnson Administration backers--who have, in large part neatly transferred their allegiance to a logical heir apparent--do not seem to realize that in the last three years, events have caused new cracks in the Democratic Party which Humphrey's pleas for \"tolerance, understanding, and mutual trust\" cannot paper over.</span></p> <p><span>At this date, the Vietnam war, the rise in urban violence, and Lyndon Johnson's idiosyncratic conduct as President appear to have split the party into three new wings.</span></p> <p><span>One faction is led by Senator Robert F. Kennedy.  Its leadership believes in an innovating activist national executive.  Although many of its members back the former Attorney General for emotional or ethnic reasons, the Kennedy faction seems committed to unconventional solu- tions to poverty, crime, prejudice, and leftist revolutions abroad.  Kennedy's most articulate supporters believe that time has come to move beyond the social palliatives of the past 35 years to insure decent living standards, education, and employment for all citizens.  The mood of many Kennedy supporters is characterized by disgust at the sterility of most liberals' response to national crisis and conviction that material and political resources are available to avoid Vietnams at home or abroad.</span></p> <p><span>If most Kennedy people are anxious to get on with their good works, supporters of Senator Eugene McCarthy want to take stock of the individual meaning of political action.  What distinguishes many McCarthy backers from those supporting Kennedy is a deep concern over the personal qualities of a President.  In fact, the surprising turnout for McCarthy is a reflection of the deep anxiety about the morality of politics that Lyndon Johnson--and apparently Robert Kennedy--have stirred.</span></p> <p><span>McCarthy's attempt to fudge on the specifies of his proposals, and his ability to inspire confidence with soft-spoken wit and snide commentary on other candidates illuminate his psychological strategy.  This tack, of course, has the drawback of alienating many black voters.  It also confirms the suspicion that McCarthy has too much arrogant cynicism to be an active, imaginative President.</span></p> <p><span>The emergence of the Kennedy iconoclasts and the McCarthy moralists, of course, was probably not possible with-race riots, or a TV in every home.  Still, the iconoclasts and moralists easily outnumber the Humphrey wing of the party.  This faction seems to be composed, in large part, of older people who have grown comfortable and powerful with the FDR-HST-JFK-LBJ brand of liberalism:  give a little to everybody at home and keep the Communists at bay abroad.</span></p> <p><span>What Humphrey and his backers, however, may not realize at this date is that the Democratic Party may pay little heed to its historical successes, fully aware at last that new techniques of political activity and new programs are required.

If enough Republicans vote in the Democratic primary--either from a dislike of Nixon or boredom with the GOP's non-contest--they can swing the Democratic race.</span></p> <p><span>Virtually all of this Republican cross-over will go to McCarthy, observers agree, since he offers the only clear alternative to Nixon.

{"title": "Lucky Lyndon | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>L</b>YNDON JOHNSON'S curious remark that, \"the New Hampshire primary is one that anyone can enter and everyone can win,\" may yet prove one of the most astute comments on that event.  Like the Tet offensive in Vietnam, the magical 42 per cent of the vote Senator McCarthy commandeered turned the 1968 campaign into \"an entirely new ball game\" in a number of ways.  The primary, regarded as a sharp rebuke to the President himself and/or his Vietnam policy, may actually be an ironic stroke of fortune in an otherwise steadily growing list of political nightmares for the man from Johnson City.</span></p> <p><span>First, the much heralded McCarthy \"win\" in New Hampshire cost Johnson only twenty delegate votes.  A recent New York <i>Times</i> survey showed Johnson still in control of, or likely to control almost two-thirds of the convention's delegates.  The media, however, in focusing so closely on New Hampshire, make Johnson's fall appear imminent, if not inevitable, and the President, in recent speeches, has even tried to project an image of himself as the underdog.  Particularly since the New Hampshire, primary immediately preceeds the Wisconsin race, in which McCarthy has always been expected to do well, Johnson himself is now in a position to score a \"moral victory\" should the Minnesota Senator fail to sweep the state convincingly.</span></p> <p><span>Secondly, the New Hampshire victory supplies a convenient smoke screen under which the Johnson forces can pour heavy financial and organizational reserves into Wisconsin and the later primaries.  The President was unwilling to appear overly concerned about the McCarthy challenge in New Hampshire.  Now his campaign can be couched as a justifiable effort in self-defense rather than an exercise in overkill.</span></p> <p><span>In Wisconsin, the Johnson campaign, featuring Hubert Humphrey, Agriculture Secretary Orville Freeman, Postmaster General Lawrence O'Brien, and HUD Secretary Robert Weaver, has been pressed with a new vigor, and an ample fund of national Democratic Party money.  Before New Hampshire, such tactics would have looked like unfair bludgeoning of an unarmed opponent.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>NSTEAD of seeming to muffle dissent, Johnson now argues that he is defending his own right to articulate American policy in the face of forces which would deny <i>him</i> a hearing.  \"I'm not going to sit by and let [my programs of social justice] be torn down in a partisan political year,\" he told a Building and Construction Workers Union conference on Monday.</span></p> <p><span>Thirdly, McCarthy no longer has the advantage of being able to speak almost exclusively to the issue of the war.  With his \"victory\" in New Hampshire, and his insistence that he now has his eyes on the White House, the Senator must comment more extensively on domestic problems, and indeed, outline more specific proposals for getting the United States out of Vietnam.  The recent departure of his two chief press aides, complaining that McCarthy was not addressing all the issues, along with the impending defection of advisor-speechwriter Richard Goodwin hint at the beginning of the breakdown of that rare but genial coalition of fairly radical anti-war students, ADA liberals, and Texophobes who had joined to support McCarthy in New Hampshire.</span></p> <p><span>The New Hampshire primary drew Robert Kennedy into the race in what some observers have called an impulsive reaction to the remarkable McCarthy showing.  Though Kennedy's candidacy will doubtless cut deeply into Johnson support in some of the larger states such as New York and California, McCarthy might well have gained significant support in these states anyway.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>S IT IS, the prospects of a disastrous Kennedy-McCarthy showdown in Oregon, Nebraska or Indiana now seem high.  Even if Johnson does not win outright victories in these primary states, the anti-war financial support as well as staff will be badly split.  The dream of the anti-war forces, a joint Kennedy-McCarthy attack on the President's policy, is melting in the heat of success.  McCarthy seems more than a little annoyed at Kennedy's haste, and remarks half-whimsically that, \"the track is getting a little crowded,\" while Kennedy supporters quietly insist that the Minnesota Senator will be forced to defer after the two clash in their first primary encounter.</span></p> <p><span>The President's campaign rhetoric is already beginning to emerge.  \"I am not saying you never had it so good, but it is a fact, isn't it?\"  Johnson said Monday in a quote which will no doubt be echoed countless times throughout the campaign.  Johnson clearly isn't going to get any votes from those who don't agree that they \"never had it so good.\"  He evidently plans to convince the majority who do that he is personally barring the door against terrific pressures from the murky outside.  Following New Hampshire, Johnson's \"lonely crusader\" pose has become much more credible and may even work to counteract the image of image of willful petulance which has been at the base of much of the anti-Johnson sentiment in the country.  As George Meany told the Building and Construction Workers, \"I don't think we are going to turn a back on a friend just because he has a difficult task to perform at a time when he needs his friends more than ever.\"</span></p>"}

This was the first time the <i>Globe</i> had supported a political candidate since it backed William Jennings Bryan in 1896.  Needless to say, the <i>Globe's</i>abandonment of its 72-year policy of neutrality created some consternation in the Hicks camp.  \"I'm told Louise Hicks blames the <i>Globe</i>for her defeat,\" comments Charlie Whipple, head of the <i>Globe's</i>editorial staff.  He adds gravely, \"I find that comforting.\"</span></p> <p><span>Not until quite recently has the <i>Globe</i>had the luxury of taking pleasure in the enemies it makes.  Ten years ago, the <i>Globe</i>was a second-rate home-town paper engaged in a survival struggle with local competitors.  \"The <i>Globe's</i>only aim was to survive,\" recalls Whipple.  Neutrality was maintained partly by choice but predominantly by necessity.  Since then, a relaxation of competition has allowed the <i>Globe</i>to emerge as a responsible political force and as one of the major papers in the country.</span></p> <p><span>The <i>Globe's</i>change has not, of course, occurred spontaneously.  The principal engineer has been editor Tom Winship.  Whipple, without a trace of simulated loyalty, calls him \"the spark--the dynamo--that has really accomplished the change.\"</span></p> <p><span>Since Winship came to the <i>Globe</i>as managing editor in 1957, he has  gradually revamped the staff by appointing a crop of younger editors and by hiring specialists to cover fields like medicine and education.  He has brought the <i>Globe</i>to near-saturation in syndicated copy:  The <i>Globe</i>now has rights to 7 or 8 wire services and about 22 syndicated columnists.</span></p> <p><span><b>Truman in Shirt-Sleeves</b></span></p> <p><span>More than that, Winship has not hesitated to model the <i>Globe</i>after his own personality.  In style, he is the archetypical American rogue, some-what of a Harry Truman in shirtsleeves.  He wants to put out a paper with flair, with a slightly flippant attitude.  He has what can only be described as a profound appreciation for reckless headlines:  he still likes the one run in 1959 when Rockefeller stepped out of the 1960 Republican race--\"Rocky Won't Roll.\"  Looking at the old headline a few weeks ago when Rockefeller again withdrew, Winship smacked the desk appreciatively and declared, \"Isn't that good?\"</span></p> <p><span>Beneath the front-page Winship wearing baby-blue suspenders, however, is the editorial Winship -- the staunch old American idealist.  He believes in honesty, simplicity, loyal opposition when necessary.  He is not a subtle thinker, but an earnest one.  \"There is nothing that would improve the image of America more than if we passed a 'Ghetto Tax,'\" he suggests.  On second thought, he sees the impracticality of his proposal--\"but what a wonderful commitment of national purpose.\"  If you bring up America or the <i>Globe</i> in conversation, you are touching his soft spot.  He waxes maudlin and concludes, \"I know that sounds corny,\" more to emphasize that he takes his words seriously than to excuse himself.</span></p> <p><span>Winship would like, perhaps most of all, to have a hand in political and social reform.  The<i>Globe</i>is the instrument for political action he has been given to manage, and he has instnictively worked to make the old home-town paper an effective political organ.  \"Winship will promote anything aimed at the development of the core city,\" observes Alexander Haviland, the <i>Globe's</i>executive editor.</span></p> <p><span><b>\"Much Much More Money\"</b></span></p> <p><span>It was Winship the reformist that initiated a 36-page supplement on poverty programs last month (March 19)&gt;  The report included the first comprehensive listings of agencies and programs--public and private--involved in the Boston area's War on Poverty.

He represents the sound citizen with a stubborn faith in the system and in American ideals.  \"I'm not shouting from rooftops to tell people to throw bricks,\" he says. \"I'm old-fashioned enough to think that's not the best way of getting political action.\"  Characteristically, he proposes as solutions to the problem of urban unrest \"much much more money\" from the federal government and greater sacrifice from the business community.</span></p> <p><span>A glance at an issue from the early '50's reveals how politically phlegmatic the <i>Globe</i>used to be.  As late as 1956, the front page of the <i>Globe</i>carried almost nothing but local murders, fires, accidents, strikes and suicides, with an emphasis on the bizarre.  A typical lead articles tells of a sideshow performer who walked into a Pittsburgh police staion and \"told a weird and tearful story of having shot to death her roustabout lover on a lonely Kentucky road.\"</span></p> <p><span>Now it is rare that non-political news gets lead headlines.  Says Ian Menzies, managing editor of the Morning <i>Globe,</i>\"Tom (Winship) would fill the whole front page with politics if he could.\"  There remain, to be sure, vestiges of the old home-town paper.  Pictures of by-standers comforting the victims of car accidents still get put on page two.  Violent headlines are the rule, even for routine items.  But the grosser forms of parochialism have been removed.</span></p> <p><span><b>Ex-Communist Editor</b></span></p> <p><span>The editorial pages have unedrgone a similar metamorphosis.  A decade ago, editorials were still being written in nineteenth-century Bostonian prose.  In 1953, the Globe ran a lead editorial on Fitzgerald's translation of the <i>Rubaiyat:</i></span></p> <p><span><b>How useless has it proved to be, trying to give Omar a black eye?  He is an educated man of the world, somewhat like Quintus Horatius Flaccus, good company, urbane, witty, tolerant...  If the noble vintage of his petry ever made adipsomaniac or his indulgent smile ever broke up a marriage, that news has yet to come in over the teletype.</b></span></p> <p><span>Editorial style now is terse and unpretentious.  More to the point, charming irrelevance has given way to sober reformist mood.</span></p> <p><span>Winship has chosen a political man like himself -- a mellow dex-radical named Charlie Whipple--to head the editorial staff.  As an undergraduate at Harvard in the '30's, Whipple was a card-carrying Communist and was arrested picketing Sears, Roebuck.  After working his way from office boy to reporter on the <i>Globe,</i>he spent two years as a guild organizer before returning to the paper.  (He no longer agrees with the guild and is not a member, but he remembers that he \"gave it may all in those days.\")</span></p> <p><span>Under Whipple's editorship, lead editorials have become as earnestly political as he himself is.  Tea-table prose has been relegated to the \"relief\" editorial, an intentionally frivovlous piece at the bottom of the page.</span></p> <p><span>Whipple's tampering with the editorial page has occasionally met with opposition.  Since 1880, the lead editorials in the <i>Globe</i>have always been signed \"Uncle Dudley.\"  When Whipple decided to remove the embarrassing signature three years ago, he came up against stubborn staff resistance.  Members of the staff argued that \"people always talked about 'what Uncle Dudley said.'\"  Whipple went ahead and removed it.  He adds parenthetically that he received only one letter after it was removed:  \"I'm glad you killed off Uncle Dudley--he was a nigger lover.\"</span></p> <p><span>Readers had become less provincial themselves by the early '50's.  According to Menzies, the influx of technically oriented people to Massachusetts when electronics plants began to go up around the new Route 128 provided new readership.  The <i>Globe</i>staff responded to a group of more cosmopolitan readers--and began hiring non-native reporters.</span></p> <p><span><b>Breathing Room</b></span></p> <p><span>Ironically, it was also at this time that the Globe began to become less concerned about reader response.  For the first time in its history, the <i>Globe</i>did not have the feeling of being \"sat on\" by competitors.</span></p> <p><span>When the <i>Globe</i>was established in 1872 it was a home-town paper in what Menzies calls \"the most competitive news town since the word go.\"  Boston, until recently, has had more papers per capita than any city in the United States.  In the 1880's and '90's, six papers competed with the <i>Globe;</i>advertisers, by threatening to switch to other papers, wieled crippling power.  If rain was predicted for Easter, advertisers forbade the <i>Globe</i>to print the weather on Good Fritay for fear that sales would slip.  The <i>Globe</i>tad no choice but to comply.</span></p> <p><span>In 1941 the <i>Transcript</i> folded.  However, the <i>Globe</i>was still one in six, and as the only fence-sitter was in serious trouble.  Between them, the other papers captured most of the Democratic and Republican readers and threatened to squeeze out the <i>Globe.</i></span></p> <p><span>Even as late as the McCarthy period, the <i>Globe</i>felt forced to cling to its policy of vigorously dodging controversy.  James Morgan, then editor of the editorial page, feared the <i>Globe</i> would lose a huge block of readers if it came out against McCarthy.  He adopted a policy of silence.  Says Whipple, who as an ex-Communist was no McCarthy sympathizer, \"We tried to express ourselves between the lines rather than in.\"</span></p> <p><span>Dubious as it sounds, the <i>Globe</i> did just that.  If you search closely through. editorials of 1953, you find several cautiously couched barbs at the manner in which the McCarthy hearings were conducted.  The strongest editorial asks, \"Is it just, or indeed possible, to make our diplomatists the laughing stock of the world by forays among them which resemble a chapter in Dick Tracy?\" On the whole, though, editorial writer Don Willard accurately sums up the <i>Globe's</i> McCarthy record as \"cowardly.\"</span></p> <p><span><b><i>Hopelessly Middle-Brow</i></b></span></p> <p><span>Since the fifties, a series of foldings and mergers has reduced competition dramatically.  The <i>Post</i> folded in 1956, the <i>Record American</i>merged with the<i>Advertsier</i> in 1961, and the<i>Herald Traveler</i>merged last July.  The staff no longer worries about the <i>Globe's</i> circulation figures.  When asked last week what circulation was, executive editor Haviland had to call the promotion department to find out.</span></p> <p><span>The concentrated coverage that the<i>Globe</i>gave to the New Hampshire and Wisconsin primaries is a dramatic indication of their new political disposition.  Says Menzies of the <i>Globe's</i>campaign coverage, \"We try for balance\"; but what they try for often seems closer to exhaustiveness than balance.  On a day when Kennedy and McCarthy both make news.  Menzies tries to get an LBJ story and a Nixon story even if Johnson and Nixon have done nothing outside the routine.  \"What do we do on LBJ?\" he asked the other day during a page-planning session, and staff members searched through news releases to find out how Johnson had spent the day.</span></p> <p><span>Winship denies categorically that the<i>Globe</i>is pushing peace candidates.  He simply wants to get the issues and the candidates into the paper.  \"We're going to be damned scrupulously fair to all candidates,\" he insisted recently, and to substantiate it he pulled out a back issue with side-by-side pictures of Kennedy, McCarthy and Johnson.  Nevertheless, he admits, \"We gave McCarthy a break.\"</span></p> <p><span><b><i>Silent on McCarthyism</i></b></span></p> <p><span>If the<i>Globe</i>has at least temporarily resumed an editorial policy of neutrality regarding candidates, they are prepared to take flak from readers on issues.  The same paper that remained silent on McCarthyism for fear of losing readers was one of the first papers to come out against the war.</span></p> <p><span>Primary resposibility for policy formulation lies with Winship and publisher William Davis Taylor.  Winship glibly hands the credit for the<i>Globe's</i>strength to the \"wonderfully civilized Taylors\" (William Davis--now running for the Harvard Board of Overseers--is only one of a number of Taylors who have owned and published the<i>Globe's</i>for three generations).  But although Taylor was responsible for the <i>Globe's</i> backing of Kevin White and consults with Winship on important questions, his contribution has largely been one of non-interference.  The active policy-makers are Winship and Whipple.</span></p> <p><span>Charlie Whipple set the<i>Globe's</i>firm but moderate dovish position last May with a series of six page-long editorials criticizing American involvement step-by-step.  (A reprint of the series has gone through three printings and has sold 20,000 copies.) Silnce then the<i>Globe</i>staff has become increasingly dovish.  Whipple is still wary of immediate withdrawal, but adds that \"conceivably it might come to that under some conditions.\"</span></p> <p><span><b><i>Scolding Eisenhower</i></b></span></p> <p><span>The<i>Globe's</i> opposition to the war is based on a sons-of-Lincoln idealism.  U.S. involvement is not so much immoral in terms of universal humanitarian values as it is violation of traditional American values.  Editorials are geared toward building a broad<jtp>\n</jtp></span></p>"}

Humphrey was the most conservative candidate to seek the nomination of the Democratic party,\" a Texas congressman said last week.  \"But he sure is.\"</span></p> <p><span>Old Triple-H fondly tells college students that he has always been \"a rebel without a cause,\" but they only remember that four years ago he joined the party establishment:  (the civil rights crusader who fought the Dixiecrats at the 1948 convention and who managed the 1964 Civil Rights Bill past a Southern filibuster has become the vice-president who said the Riot Commission's conclusion \"is open to some challenge.\"  And the visionary statesman who first proposed the Peace Corps and who pushed the test-ban treaty has been the Vice-president who was a leading spokesman for his Administration's war.</span></p> <p><span>In 1960 presidential contender Humphrey spent his grocery money to appeal for popular support in two rugged primaries.  This year Humphrey's candidacy will be bolstered by wealthy Democrats who fear Bobby Kennedy--but now his strength lies with the power brokers in non-primary states.</span></p> <p><span>Humphrey's largest power base is the South, which has been quick to recognize the surest way to stop Kennedy, Texas, Virginia, North Carolina, Louisiana, Florida, South Carolina, and Tennessee all plan to line up behind favorite sons to hold their delegations for the Vice-President.</span></p> <p><span>Beyond being a potential Kennedy-stopper, Humphrey has won Southern support with his firm stand on the war and with his frequent trips to Southern capitals in the last year.  Last May, when Southern anger over the school desegregation guidelines was at its height.  Humphrey visited the Southern governors to soothe their feelings.  The highlight of this effort came in Georgia, where he put his arm around Lester Maddox and called him \"a good Democrat.\"</span></p> <p><span>Democratic governors will meet this afternoon in St. Louis, and the Southerners will present their strategy for supporting Humphrey.  Their biggest problem will be to fashion a civil rights stand which they can support but which their candidate will accept.  The conference might show that the South is not solidly behind Humphrey.  If the governors feel that Kennedy is too far ahead, they might decide to forget HHH and push Texas Governor John Connally for Vice-President.</span></p> <p><span><b>O</b>RGANIZED labor, which dislikes Kennedy almost as much as the South does, has provided Humphrey's most enthusiastic backing in the last two weeks.  Labor support will be most significant in Pennsylvania, where it controls most of the party organization.  Philadelphia has an independent party, but Mayor James Tate remembers Humphrey's crucial assistance in his re-election campaign last fall.  The city chairman, 29-year-old Rep. William J. Green, will be able to gather only a few Pennsylvania delegates for Kennedy.  In Michigan, UAW President Walter Reuther also has close ties to Humphrey, but most of Michigan's liberals are privately for Kennedy, and the New York Senator is expected to win at least half of the delegation.</span></p> <p><span>Mayors of large cities are generally for Humphrey, but most of them will have little voice in their delegations.  The mayor of St. Louis has strongly endorsed HHH, but the undecided Missouri state committee has officially asked Gov. Warren E. Hearnes to tell its delegation what to do in Chicago.  A party official in Ohio says that Humphrey's mayors will have \"a negative influence in the caucuses\" at the convention.  Another top Democrat predicted that 90 per cent of Ohio's votes would go to Kennedy if he pledged to \"cooperate\" with party leaders on federal patronage.</span></p> <p><span>Humphrey's most important aid could come from his \"constituency of one,\" Lyondon B. Johnson.  But the President has told Democratic leaders that he will not try to influence their choice--a large-scale effort by the White House to secure Humphrey's nomination could destroy Johnson's statesmanlike pose, and it would humiliate the President if it failed.  Some of LBJ's closest friends have predicted that he might not even endorse his Vice-President.</span></p> <p><span>Even if he tried, there would be no way for Johnson to transfer his solid support from black voters to Humphrey.  Humphrey has an imposing civil rights record, but Kennedy's emotional appeal to blacks appears too much for anyone to overcome.</span></p> <p><span>The major result of the President's aloofness will be to free the party leaders in major states who had been holding their delegations for Johnson.  Gov. Richard J. Hughes, formerly a staunch LBJ man, has decided to hold his delegation uncommitted as a favorite son.  But the state's top leaders--John V. Kenny, leader of the Hudson County stronghold, Rep. Frank Thompson, and state chairman Robert J. Burkhardt--haev announced for Kennedy, and privately Hughes concedes that RFK will win the nomination.</span></p> <p><span>In Connecticut, Mayor Richard Lee of New Haven and Sen. Abraham Ribicoff have close relations with the Kennedys.  So does John Bailey, state and national party chairman, who had been holding his state for the President.  While Bailey might be forced to include a few McCarthy supporters in his delegation, most of the state's votes will probably go to Kennedy.</span></p> <p><span><b>G</b>OVERNOR Robert Docking of Kansas, who had supported Johnson, has declared his neutrality, but most observers give his delegation to Kennedy.  Iowa which had been solid for the President under Gov. Harold Hughes, is rated an even split among Kennedy, McCarthy, and Humphrey.</span></p> <p><span>Richard Daley, mayor of Chicago and boss of the Illinois party, had pledged his 118 votes to the President.  After Johnson withdrew, the two men talked about the race, and Daley reported that neither of them even mentioned Humphrey.  The mayor has been extremely close to the Kennedys, and he is expected to throw his support to RFK just before the convention.</span></p> <p><span>Only a major slip by Kennedy would convince the leaders who control these states to switch to Humphrey.  But even RFK admits that he might stumble badly.</span></p> <p><span>His first primary is May 7, in Indiana, a conservative state whose rural lower half is as southern as Mississippi.  Roger D. Branigin, the most popular governor in the state's history, controls the amazingly powerful party organization.  The leading paper in the state, the Indianapolis Star, buries news of Kennedy and McCarthy deep in stories headlining Branigin's latest support from county leaders.  Branigin entered the primary as a stand-in for Johnson, and polls showed him leading Kennedy and McCarthy.  After Johnson's withdrawal, he decided to stay in the contest, probably to hold his state for Humphrey, and his strength increased.  But with Larry O'Brien directing Kennedy's campaign, and with a $600,000 budget, RFK has been given a new chance by political analysts in Indiana.</span></p> <p><span><b>M</b>cCARTHY has been concentrating on the primary in Nebraska, a cautions farm state which could be expected to reject an eastern millionaire.  McCarthy seems to be trailing however.  Most of the state's 120,000 Democrats live in Omaha and Lincoln, and 15,000 of them turned out to greet Kennedy in Lincoln last week.</span></p> <p><span>If Kennedy sweeps the primaries, Humphrey will have to form a coalition with McCarthy, his long-time junior ally from Minnesota.  But that might come too late to stop Kennedy, and McCarthy might not be able to control his delegates.</span></p> <p><span>James H. Rowe Jr., a Washington attorney who planned Humphrey's primary campaigns in 1960 and who has been organizing his effort in the last two weeks, admits that his candidate is \"starting pretty far behind.\"  Other Humphrey supporters glumly recall that the Vice-President doesn't have a winning record.  In 1952 he helped Stevenson win the nomination but then watched the Vice-presidential nod turn away from him.  In 1956 his open candidacy for the second spot was smothered by Kennedy and Kefauver.  Four years later, he lost miserably in West Virginia.  The next year he was by-passed for the Senate majority leadership.  In 1964 he agonized while Lyndon B. Johnson dangled the Vice-Presidency before McCarthy and Thomas Dodd.  In the new administration he hoped for the poverty program but was assigned the war effort.</span></p> <p><span>\"If anyone deserves a break,\" Robert Kennedy said last week, \"Hubert does.\"  But Humphrey needs a lot of breaks to be lucky this time.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Feeding Problems | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>W</b>HILE the big guns of Senator McCarthy's Wisconsin campaign were firing away at Administration policies, a smaller, but at times almost as nasty skirmish flourished between the Senator's staff and national reporters covering the campaign.</span></p> <p><span>Newsmen griped--constantly in private, sometimes in print--about the ineptness of McCarthy's organization.  McCarthy staffers retorted in private that the reporters didn't understand that McCarthy was trying to create \"a new 1968 politics\" by building much of his organization from political amateurs.  And, one day, McCarthy himself said that some of the press were \"frustrated campaign managers.\"</span></p> <p><span>It was more than the usual crossfire between politicians and press.  In this case, the newsmen were concerned not with the ultimate aims or tactics of the McCarthy machine, but rather with its efficiency.  One newsman, who admitted that he didn't care for Nixon's personality or his policies, nevertheless said that the former Vice-President's well-oiled campaign \"almost makes a man prefer Nixon.\"</span></p> <p><span>From their point of view, the reporters had reason to complain.  The McCarthy organization could muster thousands of volunteers from throughout the nation to canvass Wisconsin voters for the Senator, but it often broke down when confronted with the more sophisticated parts of running a campaign, particularly the delicate job of managing the media.</span></p> <p><span>McCarthy himself often irritated the newsmen by junking speeches prepared by Richard Goodwin in favor of his own at the last minute.  Reporters who had early deadlines and thus field their stories from the advance text boiled at this habit.</span></p> <p><span><b>C</b>ONSTANT confusion--most due to simple staff errors--in the scheduling of the campaign was another sore spot.  \"Somebody thought it took two hours (instead of half an hour) to drive to Fond du Lac,\" was the explanation for one such mistake.  \"Must be the same person who thought it took two hours to fly there,\" a reporter commented.</span></p> <p><span>A Los Angeles <i>Times</i> reporter waiting through another delay took a light view of the matter and produced a \"revised schedule\":</span></p> <p><span><b>1:10 p.m.  Leave for Ripon</b></span></p> <p><span><b>1:15 Wrong turn at Woodhill</b></span></p> <p><span><b>2:40 Error discovered at Ladoga</b></span></p> <p><span><b>4:00 Directions asked at Pickett</b></span></p> <p><span><b>6:00 Arrive at Ripon</b></span></p> <p><span><b>Pick up rest of schedule advancing times by four hours.</b></span></p> <p><span>Thirty-year-old Seymour Hersh, McCarthy's press secretary at the time, picked up a copy of the fake schedule.  Though described by <i>Time</i> Magazine as \"an unexcelled master of profanity,\" he just laughed a little nervously.  But, a few hours later, Hersh justified <i>Time's</i> description when he found that someone in McCarthy's headquarters had handed out an important news release in Milwaukee while most of the newmsen were jogging along Wisconsin back roads in the press bus.</span></p> <p><span>Hersh, of course, was caught in the middle of the crossfire between press and McCarthy staff.  A former Associated Press reporter, he often reddened at the errors of local McCarthy workers.  \"NTTL\"--Never Trust The Locals--Hersh sometimes muttered during the campaign.  Such organizational problems may have eased Hersh's decision to resign a week before the primary, when he felt that McCarthy was not campaigning hard enough in the Milwaukee ghetto.</span></p> <p><span>After Hersh's resignation a high McCarthy spokesman promised assembled reporters that \"one of the top public relations outfits\" would join the campaign to improve the press facilities.  But, newsmen grmubled again on the night of President Johnson's withdrawal, when the Senator kept TV crews waiting for over an hour before he appeared for a scheduled press conference.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>FTER a particularly hard dav with the press, one McCarthy aide said that he liked some of the reporters covering the campaign, but then went on to generalize about the breed--\"A bunch of cry-babies.\"</span></p> <p><span>He was half right.  The press undoubtedly magnified the problems of the McCarthy campaign by emphasizing those closest to them--the errors of the press staff--while ignoring the sometimes inefficient, but extensive student canvassing which brought the Senator's campaign to most Wisconsin voters.</span></p> <p><span>Yet, if the reporters were \"crybabies\" it was principally because the McCarthy organization did a poor job of feeding them the Pablum which is the constant diet of most newsmen covering campaigns.  Most reporters--particularly those from the wire services and the second-rate dailies--remain encased in the womb of the press bus or plane and file a stream of speech stories, color stories, and isolated voter reaction stories fed to them in press releases or by word of mouth by the candidate's press staff.  In between deadlines, they gossip about politician, view the scenery, or ask around for the name of a good restaurant at the night's stop.</span></p> <p><span>And this is what the candidate's press staff wants.  The press is surrounded by the people who have nice things to say about the campaign.  Those with complaints -- black leaders in the Milwaukee ghetto, in the case of Wisconsin--have a harder time reaching the reporters.  When a crisis such as the Hersh resignation breaks, the campaign staff can fall back on the time-honored tradition of the \"backgrounder\"--a session in which a campaign aide gives newsmen a story which cannot be attributed except to \"a high spokesman\" or \"sources close to...\"  \"I don't want to make a public defense of the campaign,\" one such speaker began.  \"No, vou want to make an anonvmous public defense,\" one reporter familiar with the technique interjected.</span></p> <p><span>Despite their talk about \"something, new in American politics,\" the McCarthy organization did nothing to change this aspect of American politics.  They just didn't use the old methods with the efficiency to which reporters had become accustomed.  And so the occupants of the press bus sometimes bit the hand that usually feeds is so smoothly.</span></p>"}

Chayes '43, professor of Law, who is largely responsible for the Report's chapter on the mass media. \"It poses the issue in a way which can never be ignored again. The importance of this report is that it is directed not toward the President but to the public conscience,\" Chayes added.</span></p> <p><span>The Report's harshest critics, on the other hand, argue that the Committee should not have been appointed in the first place. \"I hope this does not turn out to be a historic event. It can only mark a turn for the worse,\" Edward C. Banfield, Henry Lee Shattuck Professor of Urban Government said.</span></p> <p><span>If the Report was indeed a political necessity, said James Q. Wilson, professor of Government and co-author of <i>City Politics,</i> it should have taken a very different approach.</span></p> <p><span>Debating the value of almost every aspect of the Report-its content, the formulation, the conclusions, as well as the impact these may have-Harvard academicians do agree on one point. It will not make it into any sociological anthologies. \"The data gathering process was very slow,\" Gary T. Marx, assistant professor of Sociology, who helped draft the first preliminary report, said.</span></p> <p><span>This is one of the major reasons academicians here do not feel quite comfortable with the Report. They deal with this in different ways. \"These are gut issues, I don't know why scholarship should be involved. It wouldn't be worth reading if it had been written by historians,\" said Maurice D. Kilbridge, professor of Business Administration, who teaches a course on urban problems.</span></p> <p><span>Oscar Handlin, Charles Warren Professor of American History, who has also criticized the report because it lacked \"historical perspective,\" admitted that one can not expect history to be written in the eight months it took the Commission to produce the report.</span></p> <p><span>Many, like Handlin, disagree strongly with the Report on a number of points and feel it skips over important arguments. Still they believe with Handlin that, \"the things it recommends should be done even if these are not the right reasons.\"</span></p> <p><span>The urbanologists are unwilling to criticize the Report and thus unwittingly provide ammunition to those who would ignore the issues it raises.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard scholars have therefore kept their criticisms of the Report very quiet. Daniel Patrick Moynihan ,director of the Joint Center for Urban Studies and author of the controversial Moynihan Report on the Negro family, at first refused to comment on the findings of the Riot Commission Report. Later he called the Report \"a landmark in race relations\" and commented that there were no Negroes in the Commission's research division. \"I'm not sure this analysis would have been done by Negro social scientists,\" he said. But Moynihan prefers to emphasize the \"scandalous\" reaction of the President whose most extensive comment on the Report has been to recommend it to a luncheon audience of businessmen. \"The administration consists of nothing but a bunch of patio liberals,\" Moynihan charged, including Vice-President Humphrey who has hinted that the administration was displeased to find no mention of its own legislative achievements in the Report</span></p>"}

Five of the others will be decided by the end of the week.  The rest will be determined at a Democratic State Convention in July.</span></p> <p><span>In Massachusetts, Johnson backers conceded the state's 72 convention votes to McCarthy yesterday as talk of a write-in for Johnson died down.  McCarthy supporters held an early victory party in Boston last night \"to show the press that we really think we won,\" as one worker put it.</span></p> <p><span>Hundreds of St. Paul, Minn., nuns along with thousands of other Democratic voters, turned out in unprecedented numbers to 3700 precinct caucuses Tuesday night to vote for McCarthy.</span></p> <p><span>The results, subject to ratification later by county and congressional district conventions, showed McCarthy with three of the state's eight districts and the possibility of taking a fourth.  Each of the eight districts has five delegate votes, the other 12 votes are controlled by the State convention where McCarthy supporters may have a majority.</span></p> <p><span>The Minnesota senior Senator took the three Minneapolis-St. Paul district with 60 to 70 per cent of the vote.  Vice-President Hubert H. Humphrey has always been strong in his home area, and Tuesday's results are regarded by many observers as a strong rebuff.  Four members of his own family, including his own son and daughter, were defeated in the voting for district delegates in the McCarthy landslide.</span></p> <p><span>The stunning upset (McCarthy backers only predicted taking two congressional districts) was attributed Wednesday to armies of thousands of college students \"who put together one most effective organizations this area has ever seen,\" according to one state political reporter.</span></p> <p><span>University of Minnesota students took over several wards of Minneapolis and gave McCarthy a 9-1 victory in the precincts surrounding their area.</span></p> <p><span>In Massachusetts, the full impact of Johnson's refusal to run or substitute a stand-in began to be felt yesterday.  Many of the Bay State's most prominent political figures withdrew their names from the statewide delegation list yester- \"NA,\" ten \"moved,\" and the remaining five leaning toward Johnson or undecided.  One canvasser said that he had been given 25 cards all at the same address, and when he got there he found that the address was a trailer camp with over 75 vehicles in it.  After going from trailer to trailer and being told that \"Mr. Jones had that space next door four years ago,\" he gave up, and marked all 25 cards \"NA.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>S</b>TILL, the spirit of the volunteers and of the campaign continues to get stronger.  The students feel that their work is having an impact, and that, just possbily, it may lead to a strong McCarthy showing in New Hampshire.</span></p> <p><span>The Senator himself is pleased with the canvassers' enthusiasm and support.  For the past two weekends, those working throughout the state have gathered together on Saturday night for a massive mixer-type party.  And at both occasions Senator McCarthy was there to offer them encouragement, congratulations, and gratitude.  He signed autographs, shook hands, smiled a lot, and made it all seem worthwhile.  He says his army of students is something \"America has never seen before\" and that his campaign could never have progressed so quickly without their help.</span></p> <p><span>The response in New Hampshire has been encouraging.  The vigor and enthusiasm that the student canvassers have brought to the Granite State has not been ignored by the voters.  They have been surprised and usually fairly receptive to the volunteers.  And this, of course, helps the Senator.  As the McCarthy coordinator in Nashua told the canvassers this past Saturday night, \"The people in Nashua like you, and if the people in Nashua like you, they like Senator McCarthy.\"</span></p> <p><span>Whether or not McCarthy does well in Tuseday's primary, he has succeeded in bringing a large number of young people back into politics.

We are determining the future of that area not just for the next few years, but for the balance of this century.</span></p> <p><span>If North Vietnam succeeds in this aggression, either through a negotiated settlement or a military victory, they will try the same tactic again.</span></p> <p><span>We must end it [the North Vietnamese aggression] without producing a bigger war; I reject the arguments of some to use nuclear weapons.  But we must also end it without producing another war.  Many of the peace proposals could end the war, but they would produce another war--possibly in Asia or in other areas; this would strengthen the hawks in Red China and the Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span>We have made four major mistakes in the War in Vietnam:  1.) we have grossly failed to use our military power--the policy of gradualism has been a mistake. 2.)  We haven't used the diplomatic and economic levers we have with the Soviet Union to try to get a settlement. 3.)  Our policy of training South Vietnamese is still failing to bring about the desired results; we aren't operating the pacification program very well. 4.)  Our leadership has failed to explain the war to the American people.</span></p> <p><span>This war will end when three things happen:  1.)  North Vietnam is convinced that it can't win militarily. 2.)  North Vietnam is convinced that it can't win politically in South Vietnam. 3.)  North Vietnam is convinced that it can't win politically in the United States.</span></p> <p><span>I see three great dangers in Vietnam.</span></p> <p><span>The first is that we pull out.  This would be a disaster.</span></p> <p><span>The second is that through gradual escalation the administration's policy gets us into World War III.  If in 1970 China achieves nuclear parity, plus a delivery capacity, then there is a real risk of World War III.</span></p> <p><span>Therefore we need a policy to shorten the war.  It is time to fish or cut bait.</span></p> <p><span>We must have a policy of bringing the war to a conclusion before the time of ultimate danger is here--only two years from now.  We need a policy which both militarily and diplomatically, is directed toward this end.</span></p> <p><span>But we must look beyond Vietnam.  The United States needs some preventive diplomacy to avoid getting into this kind of situation again.  Let the United States now adopt the kind of actions and diplomacy that would achieve this objective.</span></p> <p><span>In guerrilla wars of the past, we have furnished much of the material and most of the men and most of the lives.  We are rich and strong and populous.  There are nearly 200-million of us.  But there are 2-billion people in the free world.  And it makes little sense for a nation with one-tenth the world's population to be fighting wars all over the world.</span></p> <p><span>In the event that another nation is threatened, we should help them with arms--and with men--but our goal should be to help them fight the war and not fight the war for them.</span></p>"}

And still there is no comment from the White House.  \"It's a very large report,\" as the Commission's vice-chairman.  Mayor Lindsay, noted, \"and needs lots of review.  The President had little time to read it before it was published.\" But apparently he had read enough.  The commission asserted that \"our nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white--separate and unequal.\" In what may be the Administration's opening salvo at the report, Vice-President Humphrey said Tuesday that this conclusion \"is open to challenge.\" The Administration is peeved that the Commission in its effort to determine the causes and cures for riots, did not see fit to praise past achievements of the Great Society.</span></p> <p><span>Apart from some impressive detective work on the riots, there is little new or exciting in the report.  The ideas are hardly original.  But what is remarkable is the tone taken by the commission, whose membership includes a Southern police chief, two representatives, two senators, an industrialist, a labor leader, a Republican mayor, and, as chairman, a Midwest governor.</span></p> <p><span>The eleven-man Commission amazed even black militants with its unflinching condemnation of \"white racism.\" The message was very clear:  \"To continue our present course will . . . ultimately involve the destruction of basic democratic values.\"</span></p> <p><span>There is no denying that what is needed will be immensely costly, though the commission did not attempt to set a price tag on its suggestions.  It is hard to see where the money will come from.  The powerful chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Wilbur Mills, who has until now resisted Presidential pressure for a surcharge to finance the Vietnam war, warned recently that \"substantial acceleration [of the war] could force Congress to raise taxes\" but only if the government cuts spending elsewhere.  And that will of course rule out major new programs for the country's domestic ills.</span></p> <p><span>The report is proving dramatically to the nation what President Johnson has sought to play down.  The country cannot afford both the war in Vietnam and a war on poverty.  When the President appointed the commission (and called for a day of prayer) in the heat of the Newark riots it looked like a cheap way out.  The Commission has shown that there is no cheap way out.  Should the President shelve this report, having aroused and once more frustrated hopes, the country may well have to pay far more.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Kennedy's Bleak Future | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>E</b>UGENE McCARTHY'S approach to Presidential politics was startling in conception, magical in impact, darkly unpredictable in outcome.  In person and on television, McCarthy's square features, rugged voice and slightly receding hairline spelled nothing so well as \"President.\"  And while the country hasn't actually had this image in the White House since Franklin Roosevelt, Americans still know it when they see it.  It gives them pause, which in McCarthy's case was half the battle:  once listened to, his message came across with unmistakable intelligence, groping caution and unimpeachable patriotism.</span></p> <p><span>Over the weekend, Americans were treated to a radically different political style in the person of Robert Kennedy.  Whether by design or not, Kennedy suggests youth as opposed to wisdom, bashfulness as opposed to frankness.  He worries a lot about his hair and counts his teeth as a clear asset.  Like his older brother, he is attracted to a vague kind of fancy rhetoric, consisting chiefly of parallelisms (often redundant) and alliteration (often meaningless).  This means he is attracted to a speechwriter named Ted Sorensen, who apparently drafted Kennedy's kick-off speech Saturday and who cab boast some of the decade's most quoted catch-phrases, including the sinister but obviously popular \"Ask not what your country can do for you\" line.  Kennedy's delivery is fast and clumsy, and his voice squeaks along sometimes unaffected by dropped sentences, grammatical non-sequiturs and patent evasions.</span></p> <p><span><b>K</b>ENNEDY is said to be consummate behind-the-scenes man, a reputation deriving largely from his masterful work for brother John in 1960.  Public opinion polls of the last year and a half suggest he is also a <i>popular</i> as any politician has a right to be.  So it shouldn't be any great leap of the imagination to view him as virtually the ideal candidate, a one-man combine of the goods and the ability to sell them.</span></p> <p><span>McCarthy probably never had even a fighting chance for his party's nomination.  What he did have was a chance to be an agent--alongside catastrophe in Vietnam, or chaos in the United States, or both--of an open Democratic convention in August.  A Dien Bien Phu, even in miniature, coupled with race riots on a scale approaching open revolt, could make Johnson so clearly unelectable as to be unnominatable.  It was this picture, or one quite like it, which drew Kennedy into the race.</span></p> <p><span>But Kennedy's candidacy offers little more prospect than McCarthy's of dumping President Johnson--for two reasons.  First, like McCarthy, Kennedy is at the mercy of a world and national scene over which he has no influence.  Catastrophe of a grandeur sufficient to demolish LBJ, should it occur, might demolish him under any circumstances, with or without previous opposition in the primaries.  Second, Kennedy by virtue of his name and reputation must rack up overwhelming margins to equal the impact of McCarthy's 42 per cent in New Hampshire:  if the Kennedy charisma proves less dynamic in the event than in the propaganda, Kennedy will be committing premature political suicide.</span></p> <p><span>For all the risks, Kennedy's decision makes sense in purely personal terms.  His chances in '68 may be dim, but what with the strong possibility of a Republican President next year, '72 looks even dimmer.  The man who beats Johnson--call him President Nixon--would likely remain in office for eight years, sustained by a period of post-war reaction and by the dictates of political fashion.  By '76 Kennedy could be nearly as anachronistic as Harold Stassen in the current campaign.</span></p> <p><span><b>F</b>OR Kennedy, then, '68 is the lesser of at least two evils.  It is also a confession of deep political unwellbeing.  Even as he announced his candidacy, the junior Senator from New York looked less like a future President than ever before.  He has set a nearly impossible goal for himself in trying to unseat  an incumbent President, but the realization of that goal will not assure Kennedy of the nomination.  As long as President Johnson remains a major influence, he will be in a good position to veto a least one candidate, and he will surely use his veto on his old friend Robert Kennedy, even if the alternative should be a member of the same family.</span></p> <p><span>The test of RFK's electoral strength will be California.  If he ekes out the necessary plurality over Johnson and McCarthy, he will at least still be in the running, which is to say able to reap the reward if the President falters.  If, on the other hand, Kennedy achieves no better than 35 per cent, as against, say, 40 per cent for LBJ and 25 per cent for McCarthy, he will have died a quiet death and be remembered, if at all, as \"that other Kennedy.\"</span></p> <p><span>One hesitates to label such an unpromising campaign \"opportunistic.\"  Kennedy is, after all, risking everything in a year when he might risk next to nothing.  He has thrown in with the Democratic Party's bastard wing, not even sure they will  accept him.  If he has miscalculated, it is not so much out of opportunism as out of conviction:  the conviction that Robert Kennedy has what it takes in this banner year of American political history.  Given the alternatives, Kennedy's conviction is a tempting one.</span></p>"}
{"title": "The African Queen | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>C</b>ALLING himself S. P. Eagle and operating some-what nefariously out of a yacht anchored several miles off the French Riviera, producer Sam Spiegel decided to film <i>The African Queen</i> with a script by James Agee and direction by John Huston.  Legend has it that Spiegel signed the two by assuring each that the other was committed to the project, then obtaining bank financing by claiming that both were signed.  Everyone fell for the bait and Spiegel made the deal.  Regardless of the percentage of actual fact in this story, Hollywood attributes to Spiegel a pretty fair job of wheeler-dealing in launching <i>The African Queen</i> toward production.</span></p> <p><span>Small and intriguing tales like these surround the geneses of most of America's great films:  think of all those people who told Selznick that <i>Gone With The Wind</i> would never sell.  Unfortunately, <i>The African Queen</i> falls far short of greatness, selling short its colorful background, despite the efforts of its talented creators (add to the list a fine short story writer, John Collier, whose contribution to the script equalled that of Huston and Agee, and photographer Jack Cardiff, then Carol Reed's right-hand man and cameraman on Hitchcock's magnificent <i>Under Capricorn</i>).</span></p> <p><span>The odyssey of cockney mechanic Allnut (Humphrey Bogart) and missionary Rose (Katharine Hepburn) down uncharted African waters suggests tense comedy-melodrama:  they must, after all, evade rifle fire, skirt rapids, fix boilers, swat flies, brave swamps, remove leeches, blow up German cruisers, and fall in love.  Regardless, Huston injects the action with mechanical uncaring:  Allnut and Rose talk genially in <i>medium close shot,</i> one of them looks off-screen, says \"Look!\", and Huston cuts to what they see; he resorts to this lethargic montage in introducing enemy troops, the fort, all rapids, and the boat <i>Louisa</i>.  The repetition of dramatic technique promotes an episodic quality that defeats a build-up of suspense or tension; there is no attempt to vary action and the middle third of <i>The African Queen</i> concentrates solely on rapids:  a small rapid, a big rapid, and--out of the blue--a great big surprise rapid, spaced neatly at five minute intervals.</span></p> <p><span>With all sense of obstacle removed, <i>The African Queen</i> evokes all the tension of a journey from Harvard Square to Park Street; only once does Huston create a moving conflict, when Allnut, effectively de-leeched, realizes he must go back into the leech-infested swamp in order to extricate the boat from the muddy canal.</span></p> <p><span><b>F</b>ACING the question of what Huston <i>was</i> trying to do, rejecting melodrama, <i>The African Queen</i> can be seen as a weird-sort-of-pastoral.  Allnut and Rose fall in love early in the film and spend most of it being sentimental and affectionate.  Allnut shaves, his coarseness quite obliterated by romance, and Rose's up-tightness vanishes after the first clinch; the boat becomes a house in suburbia and Allnut views the tropical wilderness as a New England landscape, saying, \"I'd like to come back 'ere some day.\"  Increasingly, they address each other in blissful euphemisms:  'Dear, what's your first name?\"  asks Allnut, later calling her Rosie and \"sweet-heart\" with a devotion approaching mania.</span></p> <p><span>The establishment of middle-class British values on a boat in the jungle must have interested both Agee and Collier as script-writers; the published screenplay in <i>Agee On Film</i> lavishes detail on Cockney inflection and deliberately tortured syntax.  Here, Huston's casting defeats the intent:  however much Bogart accentuates his buck teeth, he is largely out of place as a Cockney mechanic; his best moments are asides and wisecracks reminiscent of the two Hawks films, <i>The Big Sleep</i> and <i>To Have And Have Not,</i> and he must rely heavily on a stylized comedy technique borrowed wholesale from vintage Cary Grant.  Overpraised for his character acting in this and Huston's earlier <i>Treasure Of The Sierra Madre,</i> Bogart was greatest in the romantic Hawks-Hammett-Hemingway world of the individual pitting personal morality against an inherently corrupt society, the ultimate success being the maintenance of personal self-respect.</span></p> <p><span>But Huston simply fails to give either Bogart or Hepburn enough to do in <i>The African Queen</i>.  The romance pastoral is established, but only at the expense of character development:  Huston piles close-ups of Bogart and Hepburn on top of one another, all impeccably framed by Cardiff, all suggesting nothing more than bovine contentment.  Ultimately, the comic timing of Huston and his actors save <i>The African Queen</i> from tedium:  Hepburn's superb reactions to Bogart's gin-swilling equal Bogart's own anguish at watching her dispose of it, bottle by bottle.  Lines in the printed script easily passed-by become audience-stoppers:  Bogart's apology for his growling stomach (\"There ain't a thing I can do about it.\") or his shivering disgust of leeches (\"Anythin' I hate in this world it's <i>leeches</i>!  Filthy devils!\").</span></p> <p><span>Huston's problem as a director has always been indecision.  His laconic humor and bent for undisciplined improvisation invariably takes precedence over careful development of theme through characterization and narrative.  In <i>The African Queen</i>, the pretentions of melodrama cancel-out the element of romance, providing only an irritating absence of clarity of purpose.  Considering its creators, <i>The African Queen</i> represents a sad, if entertaining, meeting of people whose careers were moving downhill.  Bogart and Hepburn had made by far their best films, she for Cukor and Bogart for Hawks; Huston's reputation as a director grew deservedly tarnished, and the best of his later films (<i>Moby Dick, The Misfits</i>) were critical failures; only Agee, in writing <i>The Night of the Hunter,</i> managed to put on screen the American romance gothic that fascinated him.  He died less than two years later.</span></p>"}

Long before the first robin will blow in from the South, farmers have begun to notice flocks of students moving in from Eastern colleges.  They are part of Sen. Eugene McCarthy's \"kiddie corps\" canvassing voters for the April 2 Presidential primary.</span></p> <p><span>The students offer Wisconsinites a refreshing relief from the hardened politicos who pass through the state every four years, their heads swimming with thoughts of 72 counties, ten Congressional districts, X number of delegates to the national convention.  Most students descend on Wisconsin with only Rand McNally memories of the state as a cheese-colored mitten, its thumb thrust into a pale blueness labeled \"Lake Michigan.\"</span></p> <p><span>This idyllic if incomplete image is soon shattered by the realities of Wisconsin politics.  \"Of all fifty states of the Union,\" writes Theodore White in <i>Making of the President 1960,</i> \"Wisconsin is probably that state in which professional politicians most hate to tempt a primary.\"  It is a vast and rugged land, and in political terms, unorganized and totally unpredictable.</span></p> <p><span>In 1960, pollsters predicted that John Kennedy would win nine of the state's ten Congressional districts from Hubert Humphrey.  The Massachusetts Senator carried only six districts, however, with a scant 56 per cent of the popular vote.</span></p> <p><span>Specters of past Presidential aspirants haunt the history of Wisconsin primaries--Sen. Arthur Vandenburg in 1940, Wendell L. Wilkie in 1944, Gen. Douglas MacArthur in 1948.</span></p> <p><span>McCarthy must also realize that candidates who do manage to survive Wisconsin often die at the national conventions.  This \"Wisconsin whammy\" has twice befallen Estes Kefauver, the choice of state Democrats in 1952 and '56, who lost the nomination both years to Adlai Stevenson.</span></p> <p><span>As a political weather vane for the national election, the Wisconsin primary--pioneered by Gov. Robert La-Follette in 1903 as the first in the nation--has failed to bend even to popular hurricanes.  In 1932, Wisconsin Democrats went for Al Smith, the rest of the nation for Franklin D. Roosevelt.  In 1952, state Republicans chose Robert A. Taft, while everyone else liked Gen. Dwight Eisenhower.</span></p> <p><span>Throughout its 120-year history as a state, Wisconsin has held an improbable rendezvous with the bizarre.  It has given the world Thorsten Veblen and the Ringling brothers, Jack Lemmon and Joe McCarthy, Billy Mitchell and Frank Lloyd Wright, Edna Ferber and Harry Houdini.  The state's contributions to American education include the first kindergarten and the first panty raid.  It is the birthplace of the Gideon Society and the Republican Party.</span></p> <p><span>The land itself is bizarre.  Five times glaciers have moved down into Wisconsin, grinding and scraping and reshaping the countryside.  In the north, the glaciers left behind jagged red granite cliffs and tickly-wooded hills.  In the south, these hills break down into gentle kettles and morraines, the pock-mark measures of the glaciers' farthest reach.</span></p> <p><span>The north is the land of Paul Bunyan, the giant lumberjack whose footprints remain as tiny wooded lakes.  Wisconsinites brag that they have more lakes than Minnesota, which supposedly has ten thousand.  The north is hunting and fishing country that has attracted such outdoorsmen as Pres. Eisenhower and Al Capone, and which each year draws thousands of tourists from the Chicago suburbs.</span></p> <p><span>The south is dairy country--the most productive in the world.  Wisconsin supplies one-seventh of America's milk, more than any other state.  It also leads in the production of cheese and milk cow and heifer herds.  The rich dark prairie land of the southwest corner--the \"driftless area\" missed by the glaciers--yields wheat, corn and hogs.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>O get an idea of the political geography of the state, it is helpful to draw a line from Chicago northward 200 miles to Green Bay, home of football's world champion Packers.  Bring the line southwest 125 miles to Madison, the clean capital and university center, and then back southeast 125 miles to Chicago again.</span></p> <p><span>Within this rough isosceles triangle, 80-miles in maximum width between Milwaukee and Madison, the two largest cities, 55 per cent of the state's population lives on 15 per cent of the land.</span></p> <p><span>The Milwaukee-West Allis greater metropolitan area, with one-and-a-quarter million people, produces farm machinery and tractors, automobile parts and, of course, the beer that has made it famous.  South of Milwaukee, in a 50-mile megopolis reaching into Illinois, are the heavy manufacturing centers of Racine and Kenosha--Wisconsin's third and fourth largest cities with close to 100,000 people each.</span></p> <p><span>The triangle contains not only most of Wisconsin's urban and industrial development, but also the finest farmland.  In addition to its proximity to metropolitan markets, the triangle offers better soil--plus the longer growing seasons afforded by Lake Michigan.</span></p> <p><span>One-third of Wisconsin voters live in the Chicago-Milwaukee megopolis, in which the Democrats' traditional big-city machines still reign.  This fact dictates state-wide strategy.  \"When I plan a campaign for Wisconsin,\" says Pat Lucey, long-time state Democratic leader, \"I plan two campaigns--one for Milwaukee and one for the rest of the state.\"</span></p> <p><span>Only one-sixth of \"the rest of the state\" lives on farms, contrary to Wisconsin's reputation as \"America's Dairyland.\"  The remainder -- just about half of the total population--lives in small cities and towns scattered throughout the state.</span></p> <p><span>Although urbanization has become the marked feature of Wisconsin's population, as of growing areas everywhere, the state remains 36 per cent rural compared to 30 per cent for the United States.  This rural population is not synonymous with farm population, since over half of it is found in towns with under 2,500 people.</span></p> <p><span>Here is the distinctive feature of Wisconsin's urbanization:  much less of the population concentrates in a few large urban centers than is true of the rest of America.  In other words, Wisconsin is urban but not highly metropolitan.  Wisconsin-born Thornton Wilder captured the flavor of the state in <i>Our Town,</i> although he indelicately set the play in New Hampshire.</span></p> <p><span><b>M</b>ANY small towns are made up of recent emigrants who still identify with their former farms and rural homesteads.  Most Wisconsinites, in fact, consider their state a \"farm state,\" though the ranks of actual farmers have been diminishing, particularly in marginal agricultural areas in the north and west.  In 1967, the state lost about 2,000 farms.  One- fifth of the remaining 116,000 fall into poverty levels as defined by OEO.  About 5,000 farmers in the lowest ranges hold part-time jobs to supplement their incomes.  With this changing trend of recent years, Democrats have made inroads into the traditionally Republican farm vote.</span></p> <p><span>Historically, the political dialogue in Wisconsin has been between LaFollette Progressives and conservative Republicans.  As Theodore White put it, \"Progressives were the first party, Republicans the second and the Democrats a poor third.\"</span></p> <p><span>With the collapse of the Progressives after World War II, this pattern was destroyed.  Sen. Robert LaFollette Jr. rejoined the GOP, which his father had dominated a generation earlier, only to lose to Joseph McCarthy in the 1946 Republican primary.  Since then, the Republicans have captured ever increasing control from the Progressives, who have shifted--along with the state as a whole--toward the Democratic Party.</span></p> <p><span><b>U</b>NTIL recent years, Democrats did not win state office in Wisconsin.  As late as 1938, they could claim only eight per cent of the general vote.  In 1957, William Proxmire became Wisconsin's second Democratic Senator in the century by capturing the seat left vacant by the death of Joseph McCarthy.  The next year, Gaylord Nelson--now also a U.S. Senator--became the second Democratic Governor in the century.</span></p> <p><span>This gradual shift of Wisconsin voters to the Democratic ranks may be seen in the composition of the two state bodies, the Senate and the Assembly.  The 100-man lower house had one to six Democrats during the '20's.  FDR swept in an all-time high of 50 in 1932, and there were 11 to 26 in the '40's and 24 to 55 in the '50's.  Today Democrats hold 47 Assembly seats.</span></p> <p><span>In the 33-man Senate, there were zero to two Democrats in the '20's, a high of 14 in 1935, three to six in the '40's, and seven to 15 in the '50's.  Twelve Democrats currently hold Senate seats.  In addition, both of Wisconsin's U.S. Senators and three of its ten Congressmen are Democrats.</span></p> <p><span>In political terms, the most significant fact about Wisconsin is its ethnic structure and background.  Unlike most other Western states, Wisconsin was settled by immigrants who came directly from continental Europe.  Despite some emigration from New England in the Jacksonian era, most of the first settlers were refugees of the political upheavals of Europe in 1948 and thereafter.  Wisconsin's population grew from 30,000 in 1840 to 305,000 in 1850 to 776,000 in 1860.</span></p> <p><span>European immigration has left Wisconsin with a distinct state culture rather than a microcosm of the national culture.  Early settlers brought native European culture with them--their food, dress, dances and community customs.</span></p> <p><span>In Wisconsin, these Old World cultures never submerged in the great American melting pot as they have elsewhere.  The state's culture is a pot of mulligan stew, with each ingredient clearly distinguishable:  the Norwegians near Mount Horeb, the Swiss in New Glarus, the Icelanders on Washington Island.  German can be heard on the streets of most cities and towns.</span></p> <p><span>The University of Wisconsin's Department of Rural Sociology has isolated 23 different ethnic stocks as dominating various sections of the state.  German, Polish and Norwegian are the leading foreign stocks, with German dominating 51 counties, Norwegian 11 and Polish two.</span></p> <p><span>The predominant German population holds authority in high regard, particularly on the family level, and this could mean support for the authority of President Johnson.  On the other hand, Germans also have great respect for Wisconsin universities and colleges, which are among the best in the nation.  Even Joe McCarthy, who searched Harvard and other Eastern universities for Reds, carefully refrained from implicating the University of Wisconsin--despite its long liberal and socialist traditions.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE fact the Eugene McCarthy has mobilized Wisconsin colleges -- both students and faculties -- will mean additional votes for him.  Harvard students may be of more marginal value, since voters are often uneasy about what they consider \"super-sophisticated\" Easterners.  Harvard volunteers must be prepared to talk politics over beer and bratwurst in cross-roads taverns.</span></p> <p><span>A more imponderable factor in Sen. McCarthy's campaign is the traditional isolationism of German and Scandinavian groups, which has somewhat dissipated since the late '30's.  As a result of Catholic and Protestant missionary work in China and Japan, many Wisconsin congregations identify with Asia.  The state's stand on the war, however, has never been put to the test.</span></p> <p><span>Probably the biggest plus that McCarthy carries into Wisconsin is his religion.  The state is one-third Catholic, and more than 40 per cent of the primary vote will be cast in Catholic Democratic cities in the east.  In the 1960 Kennedy-Humphrey contest, it was estimated that up to three-fourths of Wisconsin Catholics voted Catholic.</span></p> <p><span>The Protestant majority consists of several large Lutheran denominations (about one-fourth of the state), as to be expected of a heavily German and Scandinavian ethnic population.  The Jewish population is about two per cent and concentrated largely in Milwaukee County.</span></p> <p><span>White \"backlash\" is an important new force in Wisconsin politics.  The 1960 census listed 2.4 per cent of the state's population as \"non-white.\"  Over 80 per cent of this group is Negro, with 15 per cent Menomonie Indian.  Non-whites make up 3.2 per cent of urban areas and 6.7 per cent of central cities.  Since 70,000 of the state's Negroes live in such cities, and only 5,000 in the rest of the state, the race issue has not yet confronted many Wisconsinites.  One-tenth of the counties have no significant Negro population.</span></p> <p><span>Racial prejudice nevertheless runs high in rural Wisconsin.  Despite liberal state legislation, many small<jtp>\n</jtp></span></p>"}
{"title": "Vietnam:  An Outside Perspective | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>My first glimpse of the war came before I had even set foot in Vietnam.  As our Pan Am jet passed over the province east of Saigon an army officer next to me pointed out some Air Force jets in an airstrike.  All I could see were the wings swooping down beneath some hills to reappear seconds later.  Any explosions were hidden from sight by the hills.  I saw plenty of old bomb craters filled with rain water.  You could practically follow the craters right into the approaches to Saigon's Ton San Nhut airport.  So there really is a war going, I thought.  Such are first impressions.</span></p> <p><span>When the plan had taxied, everybody simply got up and walked into the 90-degree heat and headed for the military or civilian arrival areas.  Waiting for baggage and immigration clearance took an hour in a plain little room bearing a welcome sign posted by Rotary International (luncheon meetings every third Tuesday, 12:30, at the Saigon Hotel, coat and tie.)</span></p> <p><span>I spent a week in Saigon getting USAID identification cards, a px ration card, a Vietnamese driver's license, seeing Saigon and getting used to the look and feel of siege.  At night I sampled the restaurants, favoring the old French Colonist haunts.  The best of a good lot was a purely Vietnamese place, the My Canh, a floating restaurant tied up on the Saigon riverfront.  It made news last year when a VC satchel charge ripped it and several patrons apart.  As much as I enjoyed eating there, there was an indecent feeling about consuming sweet and sour pork, Carling's Black Label and fruit and nuts while listening to artillery across the river and watching the illumination flares slowly parachute down onto the countryside.  It was like watching Twelfth Street riot fires from the roof of the Detroit <i>Free Press</i> last summer.</span></p> <p><span><i>Lawrence A. Walsh is a former reporter for the Detroit Free Press who is in Vietnam with the International Voluntary Services.</i></span></p> <p><span>Several afternoons I talked my way into the briefings at the Joint U.S. Public Affairs Office in downtown Saigon.  Here the press corps is given a daily rundown on U.S. air, ground, and sea action by an information officer from the appropriate service.  All these men really do is call attention to 'typos' in the mimeographed dope sheets given to the reporters at the door.  If there are no questions from the floor (they are raised only after important battles or rumors) the briefings (called the 4:45 follies since the credibility gap days) last only 15 or 20 minutes.</span></p> <p><span>I was let down by the newsmen I met--cigars, paunches--a surly bunch.  They sneered, guffawed, and went back to crank out their stories with information they didn't take seriously anyway.  One of the accredited freelancers I met was from the Dartmouth student paper.  Complete with work shift, a bit of a beard and steel-rimmed glasses, he seemed decidedly unmilitary and way out of his element.  But he had considerable success in selling enough material to support himself in Saigon.  He first broke even with the sale of a story and pictures to Parade Magazine about the mortaring incident at the Thieu-Ky inauguration.  He and his camera were close to the spot where Vice President Humphrey, Ambassador Bunker and General Westmoreland were to be, had not rain forced the ceremonies inside.  VC mortar landed square on the spot and the Dartmouth man was in luck.</span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile I was getting used to sleeping under mosquito nets while educating my ears to the booms produced by different kinds of American ordnance used on the outskirts of Saigon at night.  The noise of shelling competed with the constant drone of helicopters and jets taking off and landing at Ton San Nhut, only a ten-minute walk from the International Voluntary Services house.  During the day I tried to get to know Saigon and imagine what it might look like without its oppressive cocoon of sandbags, barricades, rolls of concertina wire and black exhaust soot (military traffic has created so much air pollution that I wonder why the VC don't wrap their weapons in oil cloth and sit tight for two or three years while emphysema kills off all the city people in Vietnam--a new aspect of the war of attrition theory).  Concertina wire surrounds every building or monument of size.  The children here are as familiar with it as To mSawyer was with white picket fences.</span></p> <p><span>Despite the necessary ugliness, there is a great deal worth seeing in Saigon.  The markets (black and legitimate) are never dull.  Of course there are the perpetually delicate, self-possessed Vietnamese women floating by in their silken ao dais.  And for sagging American spirits there are always the px's which can meet almost any need.</span></p> <p><span>The most foolish thing I did that week in Saigon was venturing out on a bicycle.  If I meet a more harrowing experience in Vietnam between now and the day I leave I'll be very surprised.  I found myself competing with American, Korean and ARVN army trucks; with motorscooters and motorcycles, jeeps, cabs, pedicabs, horsecarts, pedestrians, and other cyclists.  The trip I took to the market was one long test of nerves and pedal-power as I continually coughed, wheezed and tried to keep fumes and soot out of my eyes.</span></p> <p><span>I did get a chance to get out into the countryside visiting Long Ai, about 40 kilometers south of Saigon.  This trip would be out of the question at night because Long Ai is the heartland of Vietcong insurgency.  The VC must drink lots of coffee with their schedule of killing by day, killing by night.</span></p> <p><span>We were in the country, all right, but traffic hadn't improved.  The roads out of Saigon are long extended sheets of olive-drab and camouflaged steel armaments--tanks, truck convoys, rifles, soldiers, fortified bridges, occasional burnt-out vehicles.  Everything and everybody had an edgy dug-in look.  In any direction you looked you could find a column of smoke or a helicopter hovering over a fixed spot.</span></p> <p><span>The first thing of consequence I did before leaving Saigon for Da Lat, the central highlands, and language training was stop at the USO.  GI's coming straight in from an 'operation' could check weapons and get showers, hamburgers, real milk and listen to rock'n'roll there.  Huge galvanized buckets of anonymously addressed letters in geographical arrangement stand around for anyone to go through (nobody does).  The letters come from school children and little old ladies usually and aren't the type soldiers are eager for.  There are stacks of old magazines, junky concession stands, and a \"boutique' selling ao-dais 'for your girl back home.'  Though the place was full, there was a depressing silence once the jukebox and pingpong noise was eliminated.  People stared blankly, watched old football games on Armed Forces TV or browsed through Life Magazines.</span></p> <p><span>I was about to quit the place when I met a soldier from Seattle, a helicopter gunner from the 162nd Assault Copter Co. in Phu Binh.  He had been in Vietnam for 17 months but had never seen Saigon--and he was only in town this time to take a flight physical for helicopter pilot school in Alabama.  He thought he had passed the physical and so became quite expansive, telling me about himself and his work \"up north.\"  He was a high school drop-out before enlisting and had failed at a few endeavors before the army.  He had won a bronze star and had seen many of the headline battles fought with the North Vietnamese along the Cambodian border.  Describing the helicopter he'd be trained to fly, the Cobra, as a \"pile of guns attached to a couple of rotary blades,\" he said with very honest pride that his helicopter experience had been the only successful part of his life and except for his mother, there was nobody and nothing at home to care about so a long war was fine with him.  He was making a lot of money, having a lot of excitement and was taken good care of.</span></p> <p><span>When I told him I was with an organization known as International Voluntary Services he noticeably winced, said I was crazy and that I should go home right away.  But he warmed up to a description of the kind of work I'd probably be doing with refugees and came out to the IVS house with me for dinner that night.  Later I drove him to the field hospital at Ton San Nhut, said good-bye and good luck, never expecting to see Mike again.</span></p> <p><span>The next morning, a few hours before taking a C-47 cargo plane to Da Lat, I found Mike waiting outside the IVS compound with a green duffle bag of things for me--insect repellent, army-issue boots, socks, shorts, and--hold on--an M-3 45 cal. machine gun and 2 clips of ammunition, something that looks like an auto mechanic's grease gun and, in fact, is called a grease gun.  I declined everything except the repellent but I was genuinely touched by his concern for my safety.  We exchanged APO addresses and agreed to take an R&amp;R together sometime.</span></p> <p><span>Da Lat, the resort spot built by the French and still appreciated by the</span></p> <p><span><b>There is a well-known and true story of Robert McNamara's difficulty with the Vietnamese language.  He likes to make a small pleasantry to his audience--usually \"Vietnam for 1000 years.\"  Unfortunately, to the Vietnamese it came out sounding quite different--\"The duck wants to lie down.\"  The Viets would always howl at this and Mac thought he had really scored.</b> Vietnamese, is their answer to Sun Valley, Palm Beach and White Sulphur Springs.  Both sides regard it as one of the trophies in this war and consequently it sees little of the fighting.  Saigon politicos and generals use it for their R &amp; R and there are serious reports that VC higher-ups vacation here too.  The unnatural quiet of this place almost becomes repugnant--all you have to do is read the Saigon <i>Post</i> or listen to the radio to know that Da Lat is leading a charmed life.  IVS hired an excellent old gentleman to tutor us for six and a half hours a day, a Mr. Thanh, Paris-educated and clothed in a French suit, beret and scarf.</span></p> <p><span>Learning Vietnamese is appropriately perplexing.  With its six distinct tonal levels, it is as hard to master as the country's current politics and history.  To sift through the grammar is easy enough but the tonal business is frustrating.  One word may have two, three, or even four completely different meanings depending upon the pitch and stress you use.  There is a well-known and true story of Robert McNamara's difficulty with the language on his frequent visits to Saigon.  He likes to make a small pleasantry to his Vietnamese audience--usually \"Vietnam for 1000 years.\"  Unfortunately his aides never told him that the printed words for the phrase have to be pronounced quite precisely to convey the message.  And every time Mac would wave his arms and give his little greeting, the audience would always hear something quite different:  \"the duck wants to lie down.\"  The Viets would always howl at this time and Mac thought he had really scored.  Maybe his French will get him by at the World Bank conferences.</span></p> <p><span>My day usually starts with a couple of roosters ruining my sleep.  Our cook brings in a nourishing, if unexciting, breakfast of hot Bulgar wheat with concentrated milk and sugar, coffee and/or Keen (Nestle's), a lemon-lime powder we use to give the filtered water some taste.  The Bulgar is like Wheatina or pablum and comes out of a big sack with an American crest on it with the USAID handshake symbol over that, followed by the words, \"given by the people of the United States of America\"--this is as close to welfare living as I hope to get.  USAID gives great quantities of the stuff to refugees but hasn't had much success in selling its tastiness.  A lot of it ends up in hog troughs.  So USAID people have printed little 'cookbooks' on 'good eating' with bulgar wheat.  The refugees still don't like it and want their rice ration back.</span></p> <p><span>My spirits really rise with the news from the Voice of America, which begins the day's transmissions with a two-minute beeping of \"Columbia, Gem of the Ocean.\"  A few bars of this serves as my daily patriotic pap and it elicits remarkable 'American' feelings and responses.  At night we get a few laughs by listening to the English-language news reports from Peking--the announcers have a vocabulary range of about 35 words chief among them being 'lackey, stooge, reactionary, aggressor, imperialist, fascist, nazi, and Glorious Chairman.\"</span></p> <p><span>In three weeks here I've gotten to know some worthwhile people.  One is an ARVN officers who saw some of the early Dak To fighting.  His family owns some hillside vegetable gardens and he took me through them.  Pointing to an ancestor shrine (which looks like bird stations on post) standing in the middle of a field he told me how much he hoped he'd be somebody's ancestor.</span></p> <p><span>I met several university (Dalat) students.  Their own histories and views of life as lived in 25 years of war were an education for me.  I think that the lack of commitment to a democratic Vietnam in these young people is understandable if still disappointing to me.  They fail to see why they should make plans for their country or themselves as the people and things will indefinitely continue to be chewed up by war.  I committed a major faux pas when I requested a forum/interview arrangement with some of the students, thinking the transcription might be of interest to an American newspaper.  My suggestion was coldly ignored.  Later I discovered that my interest in their views tagged me as a CIA man, not a popular American role in Vietnam.</span></p> <p><span>A pretty young biology teacher from the French lycee (where I'm studying Vietnamese) took two of us to a Buddhist novitiates' encampment in a pine grove to meet some young monks at work on a new pagoda.  The head man invited us in to his 'prayer house' for what turned into a proselytizing session.  He gave me an autographed copy of an anthology of Buddhist wisdom which he had edited.  I promised to read it once I knew enough Vietnamese.</span></p> <p><span>His prayer house, about as big as one of those very large doll houses in an F.A.O. Schwartz catalogue was as bare as could be except for a mat, a teapot, a tooth brush, and, disconcertingly, a stack of American comic books.  I haven't any idea what they were doing there nor did I ask.</span></p> <p><span>Maybe I shouldn't let the pat statement \"Dalat sees little of the war\" stand without some qualifications.  Every night there are 80 or 90 rounds-of 'H &amp; I' (harassment and interdiction) artillery fired into a free strike zone outside of town.  Our house is between the artillery mounting on a hill three miles from here and the free strike zones.  It's not at all uncommon to hear shells whizzing high over the neighborhood.  But if it weren't for the sake of a newsletter, I'd be completely oblivious to the noise (as, indeed, is everyone).  H &amp; I is fired mostly for psychological purposes.  Free strike zones are areas the army is allowed to pummel day and night.  Anything that moves in one of these zones--they are multiplying--is subject to all kinds of fire.</span></p> <p><span>The war did come a little closer to Dalat last week when a dam and power station outside of town were sabotaged by the VC.  The resulting flood wiped out a quarter mile of the Phan Rang/Nha Trang road (the coastal road).  Gasoline and rice used to be brought into Dalat by this road.  Speculation is that both commodities will be rationed until the road is repaired--and that could take months.  That's too bad--just getting used to 'com' (rice) and the lack of buoyancy of landrovers, Vespas, and jeeps on the pot-holed and dirt roads</span></p>"}

Lowenstein for a long time.</span></p> <p><span>\"New York lawyer?  Well, he was born there and lives there now, but he's about as well-known at Stanford or in Mississippi as in the City.  Professor?  He only teaches one course a week now, though he taught a few more courses when he was at North Carolina State a few years ago.  You can't really call him a politician completely either.  He is unique.\"</span></p> <p><span>No one who knows Allard K. Lowenstein is indifferent to him, at least not for very long.</span></p> <p><span>\"I've seen him operate . . . I'm suspicious of him, though I can't prove anything about the CIA connections you keep hearing about him,\" said Martin Peretz, the left-liberal Harvard instructor who has known Lowenstein for many years.</span></p> <p><span>One Harvard student put it differently.  \"Lowenstein is a politician; he's just too smooth.  I don't like it.\"  There are many who do.</span></p> <p><span>The Reverend William Sloan Coffin, the Yale chaplain, said, \"he's incredibly articulate.  He sees what a guy is interested in, lets him talk, and then takes what the guy just said and artfully turns it around to tie in with what he [Lowenstein] is trying to prove . . . it could be a terrible talent in the hands of a demagogue.\"</span></p> <p><span>Floyd B. McKissick, the CORE leader and an old college friend of Lowenstein's, calls it \"relevancy.\"  Barney Frank '62, Mayor Kevin White's administrative assistant, calls Lowenstein's style \"political practicality.\"  <i>Newsweek</i> recently dubbed him \"John the Baptist,\" the Saint who prepared the way for Senator Eugene J. McCarthy's presidential candidacy.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>Dump Johnson</i></b></span></p> <p><span>However his style of political persuasion is described, Lowenstein is now credited with being the prime mover in the Dump-Johnson-and-replace-him-with-McCarthy movement.  He started it early last August while most of his liberal Democratic cohorts were either promoting General James M. Gavin or talking of starting a third party led by King, Galbraith or Gavin.  The early September debacle at the National Conference for a New Politics in Chicago killed the third party movement.  With declining hopes in the Republican Party and the total failure of the Draft Bobby Kennedy movement, Lowenstein's idea of defeating President Johnson within the Democratic Party gained more credibility while he was away on a September trip to Vietnam to observe the elections as a private citizen.</span></p> <p><span>Gavin, Kennedy, and Senator George McGovern (D-S.D.), and McCarthy were all visited by Lowenstein after his mid-September return from Southeast Asia.  He was reportedly rebuffed by Gavin and Kennedy; he realized that McGovern, who is facing a hard fight for re-election to the Senate in 1968, could not possibly do it.  Adamant in his search for an anti-war candidate, Lowenstein focused on persuading McCarthy, who was already deeply disturbed about LBJ and the War, to run.  By mid-October, when Lowenstein visited Harvard in one of his frequent ten-state barnstorming tours, he was promising audiences that he had a candidate \"of great prominence\" who would announce his candidacy before Christmas.  Many thought his optimism groundless.  \"Be patient,\" he cautioned them with a confident smile.</span></p> <p><span>Since McCarthy began campaigning, Lowenstein has been plugging even harder to mold together \"dissident\" and \"concerned\" Democrats into a national McCarthy for President organization.  Jetting cross country several times weekly, handling four phone calls simultaneously, and making an appearance on \"Meet the Press\" keep Lowenstein busy.</span></p> <p><span>This isn't the first time Lowenstein has played the role of the man \"ahead of his times.\"  On civil rights, South Africa, and student power he was one of the pioneers in bringing his practical political style to bear.  The Kennedys and the McCarthys later followed his trail markers leading to new liberal outposts.  New York writer Jack Newfield likes to think of his fellow Manhattan Reform Democrat as \"the last and best liberal, one who always goes into revolutionary situations, but yet always stays a liberal.\"</span></p> <p><span><b><i>Jewish Lawyer</i></b></span></p> <p><span>Lowenstein at 38 looks more like a Jewish New York lawyer than John the Baptist.  Of average height with thick black glasses and short black hair, Lowenstein now usually dresses in a slightly rumpled business suit.  Before his marriage a little more than a year ago, it wasn't unusual to see him conducting meetings with college students in a white T-shirt and an old pair of chinos.</span></p> <p><span>Brought up on Manhttan's West Side, the son of a successful New York restaurateur, he never had to worry about money.  He was one of those teen-age prodigies who always seem to pop up at Harvard or Yale.</span></p> <p><span>He graduated from New York's rigorous Horace Mann School at 16 with varsity letters in wrestling and football while also editing the school newspaper.  The Chapel Hill campus of the University of North Carolina became the next stop.  University President Frank Graham remembers Lowenstein's reorganization of the student government which allowed Negroes like Flody McKissick, for the first time, to be elected to the student council; it made the young New York boy's name one of the best known on campus.</span></p> <p><span>The campus politician was asked by Graham, who had just been appointed to fill a vacancy as U.S. Senator from North Carolina, to be his legislative assistant after his graduation in 1949 at the age of 20.  Lowenstein remembers coming into contact with another freshman Democratic Senator during the fall of 1949, Lyndon Baines Johnson.</span></p> <p><span>The Senate office behind, Lowenstein was elected president of the National Student Association (NSA) during the summer of 1951.  Ivanhoe Donelson, a former SNCC leader, and others in the New Lelt relate his NSA presidency with his involvement as an observer of the Dominican Republic elections of 1965.  The unexpected election of conservative Balaguer aroused Leftist cries of a fixed election.  The observers, led by Norman Thomas, reported that the elections were reasonably fair.  As a consequence Lowenstein is still accused of being a CIA agent.  As far as can be determined Lowenstein wasn't offered money from the CIA, nor was any offered the NSA while he was preisdent.  Former NSA officials as well as CIA officials insist that the CIA financing of the NSA began after Lowenstein's one year term.  Lowenstein denies any connection with the CIA.</span></p> <p><span>Lowenstein next went to the Ivy League.  He spent three years as a middle-of-the-class student at Yale Law School while wrestling throughout Connecticut and politicking across the country for the first time.</span></p> <p><span>One afternoon during Lowenstein's first year at Law School, Adlai Stevenson telephoned him and asked him to come to a campaign pow-wow in Springfield, Illinois.  There he was named chairman of the National Students for Stevenson.</span></p> <p><span>After he plugged through Yale Law and a two year stint in the Army \"digging latrines,\" Mrs. Roosevelt asked Lowenstein to run a national education campaign for the United Nations Association.  He campaigned for the UN group for a year and then left to become Senator Hubert Humphrey's foreign policy advisor.  He met Senator Eugene J. McCarthy, Humphrey's newly elected junior colleague, during the spring of 1959.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>To the Bush</i></b></span></p> <p><span>At the time Lowenstein was helping Humphrey in Washington, the Rev. Michael Stewart, a British missionary, was attempting to gather evidence of the South African government's brutality in governing its UN trust territory, Southwest Africa.  When Stewart was barred from the South African mandate, he asked Lowenstein to continue his work.</span></p> <p><span>With two friends Lowenstein entered the Southwest African bush country for a \"biological expedition,\" as they described it to suspicious officials.  After weeks of watching and waiting, the three reached several chiefs who were willing to talk about government atrocities.  They were chased through the back country and just managed to leave the country before the police caught up with them.</span></p> <p><span>The evidence Lowenstein gathered he later presented before a committee of the UN General Assembly.  One top UN official called the 3 a.m. address before the committee the finest he had ever heard in his long stay at the UN.  The testimony he presented became the basis for the World Court case against South Africa for its violation of the Southwest African mandate.</span></p> <p><span>At the time of his return a \"Lowenstein for Congress\" movement blossomed, but he soon withdrew from the race and went to work for one of his opponents.  He spent the rest of the presidential year, 1960, working for the Democratic National Committee.</span></p> <p><span>In 1961 Lowenstein was asked to go to Stanford as an assistant dean of men and as an instructor in political science.  In one year he succeeded in shaking up the previously non-activist campus to such an extent that Lowenstein and the dean of students left, rather than force a confrontation between students and the Administration.  Had they remained, the office of the dean of students would have sided with the student activists.</span></p> <p><span>One Stanford student recalled Lowenstein's apartment perpetually filled with students.  \"Many met each other,\" he said, \"who would quite likely have never come into contact over the obstacles of Stanford's social life.  Stanford is still facing the effects of those meetings.\"</span></p> <p><span>After Stanford, Lowenstein went to North Carolina State in Raleigh where his activism and involvement with students in the racially tense years between 1962 and 1964 brought calls from the President of the State Senate, among others, for Lowenstein's ouster.</span></p> <p><span>Lowenstein, while a professor in 1963 at North Carolina State, was one of the prime movers behind a black Mississippi \"mock election\" which gave birth to the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP).  The election also served as a pilot project for a student movement which was later called the Mississippi Freedom Summer.  The publicity which a group of about 50 college volunteers mainly from Yale and Stanford received in their hometown newspapers for their participation in the \"mock election\" prompted Lowenstein and one or two others to organize the \"Freedom Summer\" project which sent 600 campus volunteers to Mississippi.  Lowenstein and his friends set up the project and raised most of the money.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>Happy Warrior</i></b></span></p> <p><span>The summer of 1964, when he was not campaigning in Humphrey's \"Happy Warrior\" plane, he spent working in the struggle to seat the MFDP at the Democratic Convention in Atlantic City.  The extremely bitter fight alienated him from most of the black activists whom he had been friendly with in SNCC and CORE.</span></p> <p><span>Since 1964 Lowenstein has worked as legal counsel to his family's restaurant business in New York.  He also has run for Congress once from the upper West Side (coming very close to winning); started one of the first groups to protest the war during the late summer of 1965 (Americans for a Reappraisal of Far Eastern Policy); and has been elected to the national board of SANE, the vice chairmanship of the Americans for Democratic Action (ADA), the board of the Rev. Martin Luther King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and now the co-chairmanship of the Conference of Concerned Democrats.  He is considered a prime candidate, according to national columnist James Weschler of the New York <i>Post,</i> for a seat in Congress or the Democratic nomination to oppose Senator Jacob K. Javits (R-N.Y.).</span></p> <p><span>One Massachusetts politician who has known him for nearly a decade said while watching him on television last month, \"he always appears to be making a speech, even in an informal conversation with only one or two other people.  It makes him seem insincere.\"</span></p> <p><span>No one doubts that he can give great speeches, but even his close friends like the Rev. Coffin say that, Lowenstein can never really sit down and talk with him about life in general.  Whether modesty or pseudo-modesty one can't be sure, but Lowenstein finds it very hard to talk about himself.  There is always some project which is more important than any \"irrevelant\" conversation.  He <i>never</i> slackens his pace; there is never a letup in his barnstorming pace.</span></p> <p><span>Some new liberal cause will occupy Lowenstein's time once the McCarthy campaign is over:  South Africa, the Franco regime, or most probably a sacrificial senatorial campaign.  \"I think he will always fight cursades because injustice fills him with a sense of rebellion.  He wants to be of help in some way . . . ,\" wrote Eleanor Roosevelt about Lowenstein.  Norman Thomas has nothing but the highest admiration for his young friend Lowenstein.</span></p> <p><span>At a time when liberals are under heavy attack for their views on the war and on civil rights from both the radicals and conservatives, Allard K. Lowenstein stands out as a liberal <i>par excellence.</i></span></p>"}
