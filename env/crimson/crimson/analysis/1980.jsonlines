{"title": "Calm and Rational | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b>N VIEWING President Carter's statements on the war between Iran and Iraq as a scary outgrowth of the \"Carter doctrine\", the majority opinion ignores the fact that Carter has actually responded calmly to the fighting.  The opinion also undervalues the economic interests of the United States in the Persian Gulf, and overstates the belligerence of Carter's position.</span></p> <p><span>Carter's statements have been twofold.  First, he has made extensive efforts to assure all parties, including the Soviet Union, that the United States wishes to remain neutral.  Second, he has said the United States \"cannot rule out\" the use of force to keep the Strait of Hormuz open.</span></p> <p><span>The declaration of neutrality is a realistic acknowledgement that the fighting has not yet endangered vital American interests, and that the United States has little or nothing to gain by favoring either of two unstable, anti-American regimes.</span></p> <p><span>The warning about the Strait of Hormuz is an attempt to prevent the fighting from escalating to the point where it would affect a vital international interest.  Sixty percent of the world's oil flows through the strait, and its cutoff would leave homes without heating oil and factories without fuel throughout the western world.  Oil supplies are not a mere \"phantom\" of national security.  The United States has only a six-week emergency supply of oil, and it would certainly take much longer for alternative energy sources and conservation to eliminate the shortage that blockage of the Strait would entail.</span></p> <p><span>Moreover, Carter's pledge to defend the strait is credible and does not mean, as the majority editorial asserts, that \"Carter will send in the Navy, the Air Force, and--if necessary--the Army.\"  According to a military analysis by the New York Times, keeping the gulf open would probably involve a naval mine-sweeping operation, and the United States naval force in the Indian Ocean has a \"clear margin of superiority\" over the Soviet, Iranian and Iraqi forces.</span></p> <p><span>Carter's statements bring the United States no closer to military intervention in the Persian Gulf.  They are not scary, but calm and rational.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Defending A Phantom | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>W</b>HEN BORDER DISPUTES between Iraq and Iran flared into full-scale war last week, with each side bombing the other's oilfields, the rest of the world stood to one side.  Spurned equally by the Arab socialists in Iraq and the Islamic revolutionaries in Iran, the United States could do little besides urge an end to hostilities, and for the moment, the Soviet Union appears to desire the same.</span></p> <p><span>Iraq's invasion of Iran's oil-rich Khuzistan province looks like a clear case of aggression on the part of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, seeking to establish himself as the unquestioned leader of the hard-line Arab nations.  However reprehensible Americans may find that aggression, the United States clearly cannot--and should not--take sides in this conflict.  President Carter's restraint in taking any action on the war is commendable.</span></p> <p><span>Some of his words, however, are not.  This latest Middle East war has tested Carter's doctrine of military protection for Persian Gulf oil much sooner than expected.  Pressed by reporters to clarify American intentions last week, administration spokesmen said they could not rule out the use of military force to keep open the Strait of Hormuz through which Persian Gulf passes on its way to consumer nations.</span></p> <p><span>In all likelihood, events will not force Carter to make good on that pledge in the near future.  That should not lull Americans into ignoring the meaning of this latest application of the \"Carter doctrine.\"  It means that, should this week's war or future tumults threaten the oil pipeline from the Persian Gulf, Carter will send in the Navy, the Air Force and--if necessary--the Army.  It means that, even though world oil supplies will become inadequate within two or three decades with the best possible supply situation, Carter believes it is worth fighting today to preserve this phantom of national security, our oil imports.  It means, most of all, that the United States is committed to sending its soldiers to die for the defense of an oil supply which could be supplanted with a vigorous national campaign of conservation, gasoline rationing, and alternative sources of energy.</span></p> <p><span>America's petroleum-based lifestyle must change, one way or another.  If war in the Middle East does not force that change today, depletion of oil sources will force it before the end of this century.  At best, the \"Carter doctrine\" fails to provide for our nation's energy needs beyond the next few years; should it be tested more seriously than it has been this week, it will become a policy of blood for oil.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Art Buchwald:  Portrait of a Sometimes Unfunny Man | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Art Buchwald isn't funny all the time.  In fact, when he isn't in front of a large audience, he can be remarkably unfunny.  Boring, even.</span></p> <p><span>Of course, it's asking a lot of anybody--even one of America's leading humor columnists--to be amusing every minute of the day.  And, to be fair, Buchwald can be uproariously funny when he wants to be.  It's almost as though he can turn his comic talents on and off the way he does his omnipresent tape recorder--which he uses to capture everything he says so that later he can incorporate a humorous off-the-cuff remark into a future column.</span></p> <p><span>Buchwald and tape recorder were \"on\" a week ago, when he kept a Kennedy School Forum audience chuckling for an hour by casting caustic, comedic comments at some of his favorite targets--the presidential candidates.</span></p> <p><span>\"Carter has found Washington not as easy to control as he did when he first became president,\" Buchwald told the crowd.  \"He is faced with scandal in the White House:  he hasn't solved the problems of Iran, Afghanistan, welfare reform and energy.  But I don't feel sorry for him.  As I told him the other day--after Bible class--we never promised you a rose garden.\"</span></p> <p><span>Not since the Kennedy presidency has Buchwald seen the country so interested in every aspect of the president's family life.  \"You know, if you went to a T.V. producer and said you had this idea for a T.V. series--you have this crazy family from Georgia which moves into the White House.  And the president of the United States used to sell peanuts, and before that he was captain of a nuclear submarine.  And he has a redneck brother who owns a gas station and drinks ten sixpacks of beer a day.  And he has an 80-year-old mother who used to be a member of the Peace Corps.  And his 11-year-old daughter lives in a tree house.  And one sister rides a motorcycle and the other-sister is a faith healer.  Do you know what that T.V. producer would say?\"  Pause.  \"Get rid of the faith healer.\"</span></p> <p><span>Buchwald expressed a similar passion for Ronald Reagan, calling him \"a very honorable person,\" who because of his age \"said he would be willing to be examined by a White House doctor, and if he found Reagan was senile or mentally incompetant he would resign from office.  Now the problem with this is how would they know?--Anyone who wants to be president of the United States has to be crazy to start with.\"</span></p> <p><span>But away from the podium, during an early morning chat with reporters, Buchwald spoke more thoughtfully--and seriously--about the candidates.  He thinks people are just plain bored with them all:  'It's gotten to the point now where I just get the feeling people aren't that interested,\" Buchwald lamented.  \"To write humor you've got to have people interested in the subject to start with, and you find in this campaign that whatever humor there is is in the fact that nobody likes either candidate or gives any emotional investment to any of the candidates.  That's what you deal with--the fact that nobody wants to even go vote on November 4 unless they're dragged there in chains.\"</span></p> <p><span>Buchwald said he tries to avoid writing too many of his columns on the campaign not only because people aren't that interested, but also because the candidates simply don't have much potential for humor.  The ideal candidate--and president--for comic exploitation was Richard Nixon, Buchwald recalled wistfully.  \"He was my favorite, my Camelot,\" he sighed, eyes misting over.  Reminiscing about the days of Watergate, Buchwald said, \"Everbody was lying.  It was a running story.  It ran for over a year.  It was just beautiful--you didn't have to make anything up.\"</span></p> <p><span>The Wahington-based humorist thinks the comic value of his work rises and falls to some extent with the material he's satirizing.  \"If the people are up on something and they're interested in it, then the humor of it works.  If they're not interested, then the humor doesn't work,\" Buchwald explained.  \"It's like Johnny Carson--he'll tell a joke, and if the people don't know what he's talking about, it just lies there flat.  And then he'll mention something about Billy Carter or something and he'll get applause.  So when you're in the satirical business, you're as good as the story that you're making fun of,\" he philosophized.</span></p> <p><span>But Buchwald hasn't always concerned himself with making people laugh.  He was a student once.  After a brief stint in the marines, young Art decided he should go to college.  But because he hadn't graduated from high school, he wanted to find out from a university what kind of high school courses he should take to prepare himself for the heady world of higher academics.</span></p> <p><span>So he went to the University of Southern California and stood in line with thousands of other registering students.  When he got to the front a woman handed him a card to fill out.  \"She said, 'What do you want to take?'  and I said, 'I don't care,'\" Buchwald recalled during his K-School speech.  \"She said English, and I said that was good.  Math?  I said, 'Why not.'  She said French, and I said O.K.  So I went to the next desk and the man stamped it and I was in college.\"</span></p> <p><span>After a year, though, the authorities caught up with him and reminded Buchwald that he did not possess a high school diploma.  But instead of kicking him out of school, they made him a \"special student,\" forbidding him to work for a degree.  That was just fine for the young scholar, who told his superiors, \"I don't have a high school diploma; there's no sense having a college degree.\"</span></p> <p><span>Three years went by, and Buchwald still did not have either a high school or college degree.  But he left USC and went to Paris on the G.I. bill, ostensibly to write the Great American Novel.  Now he admits forthrightly, however, \"That was just something to tell everybody.\"  Unlike the generation before his, Buchwald said his contemporaries in Paris \"never considered ourselves a lost generation because we were getting $75 a month from Uncle Sam.  If things ever got rough you could always get a job with the Marshall Plan, \"which started up so quickly and needed so many workers that you could get a job as an office boy or a mailroom clerk and two weeks later be in charge of the coal and steel industries for the Benelux countries.\"</span></p> <p><span>Buchwald failed to become one of the fast-rising young stars in the Marshall Plan, though, and in 1949 he went to the managing editor ot the International Herald Tribune in Paris and told him he wanted to do a nightclub and film column.  \"He said if they wanted someone to do it, they'd find someone and it wouldn't be me, and he threw me out of the office,\" Buchwald recalled.  Two weeks later, the intrepid would-be columnist heard the managing editor had left town for a while, and he went back to the Tribune to see the editor.  After Buchwald explained that \"the managing editor and I have been talking about me doing a film and nightlife column,\" the editor decided it was a good idea and hired him.  \"In French, it's called chutzpah,\" Buchwald said of his job-hunting method.</span></p> <p><span>It paid off.  The cigar-chomping humorist is now syndicated in 550 newpapers.  Occasionally the USSR's Pravda or Izvestia prints one of Buchwald's columns--they especially like ones critical of the administration.  \"Every once in a while I get an angry call from the State Department, and they'll say, 'Do you know the Soviets used your column this morning?'\"  To which Buchwald said he always replies, \"Stop them.\"</span></p> <p><span>Even after more than 25 years of writing a syndicated column three times a week--and tussling occasionally with the State Department--Buchwald said he doesn't think he's become stale.  \"The most dangerous thing about anything you do for awhile is predictability, and the worst thing you want to happen to you is for the reader to know what you're going to say before they read the column; and that's why I try to mix up my columns so much and I won't necessarily stick with political stuff because people can get tired of that,\" Buchwald explained during one of his serious moments.</span></p> <p><span>In the years since his Paris days some outrageous and inflamatory--and sometimes dull--680-word satires have rolled off his typewriter.  But Buchwald thinks the news that appears in the papers every day is much stranger than anything he creates.  Some examples:</span></p> <p><span>\"Take Jimmy Carter's interview in Playboy in which he said he had lusted after women in his heart, but God had always forgiven him--I could not make that up.  We now have a bumper sticker in Washington that says, 'In his heart, he knows your wife.'\"</span></p> <p><span>Or:  \"Take the FBI's recent sting operation when they caught Congressman Kelly of Florida with a bagload of money in the trunk of his car, and his explanation for this was that he was hoping to catch the person who gave it to him--I could not make that up.\"</span></p> <p><span>And finally:  \"Consider what happened a couple of years ago when Senator William Scott of Virginia was listed in the magazine <i>New Times</i> as the dumbest senator in Washington.  Now, <i>New Times</i> has a circulation of about 40.  But Senator Scott called a press conferenced to deny it--which made him the dumbest senator.\"</span></p> <p><span>If truth is wilder than Buchwald's fiction, then some of his ideas approach the ludicrousness of reality.  He predicted, for example, that by next year \"the Post Office will deliver mail only one day a year.  It'll be called mail day and it'll be a holiday like Christmas.  And you'll decorate your post boxes with holly wreathes and mistletoe, and we'll all come down in the morning and open our bills together.\"</span></p> <p><span>After so may years of coming up with ideas like that--5000 columns, a novel and a play--Buchwald has no desire to write something serious:  \"I find that whatever you can do seriously, you can do humorusly and make the same point.  The thing that has saved me I think, is that I've refrained from getting on the soapbox, though may times I'd like to.\"</span></p> <p><span>And so, he still enjoys his job, which he called the best in the newspaper business.  \"I don't live in fear of somebody taking a dislike to me and saying, 'Get rid of him.'  I have a better job than Fred Silverman--and safer...You've got to add about $150,000 a year onto that--being your own boss--it's great.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "From Usable to Entropic | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b>N 260 PAGES OF TEXT, Washington lawyer Jeremy Rifkin wants to crush conventional wisdom, rip away the illusions veiling our perceptions of the world, and revolutionize our daily lives.  He feels he has hit upon one of those great ideas that change our very existence, powerful in its simplicity and attractive in its incisiveness.  In fact, he is so confident that the second law of thermodynamics--the law of entropy--governs our being that his attempt to put forth a new world view assumes the form of a preachy polemic.  Whether or not <i>we</i> want to believe in an \"entropic\" perspective is irrelevant; Rifkin makes us think he's doing us a favor by letting us in on the secret that unlocks the mysteries of the universe.  <i>Entropy</i> adopts an \"I told you so\" tone before the fact.</span></p> <p><span>Maybe Rifkin, the author of several thought-provoking books like <i>The North Will Rise Again,</i> is right.  Maybe the entropy law does determine our fate contrary to our \"Newtonian,\" or progress-oriented inclinations.  In essence, the entropy law states that all energy flows inexorably from the orderly to the disorderly and from the usable to the unusable.  Thus, when we expend energy under the guise of progress, we are in fact accelerating destructiveness.  Presumably, Rifkin awoke early one morning and saw that this second law of thermodynamics could be applied to absolutely everything, and proceeded--with the assistance of disciple Ted Howard--to enshrine his thoughts in a reasonably priced hardcover.  Descartes watched a fly crawl across his ceiling, and invented mathematics; Newton got bruised by a wayward apple and theorized gravity; only history will tell us how it all came to Rifkin.</span></p> <p><span><b>N</b>O ONE CAN QUIBBLE with the value of having people think up revolutionary world views and test them on the public.  But in <i>Entropy,</i> no matter how alluring the thesis, Rifkin does not persuade.  Rifkin employs puerile rhetorical techniques like the word \"just\" (\"That just doesn't true,\" \"This just isn't the case,\" \"That just doesn't hold up,\" \"This just isn't so,\" to name a few).  He capitalizes phrases like \"Big Questions.\"  He uses italics.  He will do anything to help you <i>believe.</i></span></p> <p><span>Perhaps more impressive is the diverse roster of physicists and philosophers both contemporary and ancient figures whom Rifkin draws upon to prove his point.  Still, his argument flows from the sublime to the ridiculous in an annoying cycle.  His style is entropic; how else can you describe someone who in one breath quotes Einstein and in the next produces a remarkably declarative and pithy sentence like \"Wrong!\"  to refute Newton?</span></p> <p><span>Rifkin's treatment of history best illustrates the deficiencies of a book to which any reader alienated by modern society would gravitate to as an answer to his problems.  In one tidy half-page paragraph, Rifkin summarizes the historical theories of Toynbee, Spengler, Ortega y Gasset and Marx, allocating each scholar one sentence in this day of scarce resources.  His next paragraphy begins:</span></p> <p><span>No need to quibble.  Let's just say that all of these gentlemen have identified part of the historical jigsaw puzzle.</span></p> <p><span>In one gereralization, then, Rifkin explains away any theory of history different from his own--Marx never incorporated entropy into historical materialism.</span></p> <p><span>Much of what Rifkin puts forward in <i>Entropy</i> has a chillingly familiar ring.  In his effort to make a grand, holistic leap to an integrated world view--\"Here is the point where science joins metaphysics and ethics\"--Rifkin has sacrificed a good measure of substance.  But when he stops taking on great thinkers in three-page chapters and starts focusing on specifics, <i>Entropy</i> begins to suck you in, and the simple appeal of the entropy world view penetrates the rhetoric.  Essentially, the moral equivalent of war in an entropic world view is peace.  Warfare, and its preparation, are the most highly entropic (read:  destructive) form of human activity; and our aggressive drive to extract all possible unrenewable resources to feed the mechanical (read: growth-oriented) society.  Until society comes to grip with the energy crisis and moves into a new phase (\"The solar age\") we will not progress, but will instead hasten graver crises and our descent into hell, which Rifkin calls \"high-entropy.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>CCORDING TO RIFKIN, we should throw off the burdensome pre-occupatino of growth and cast aside notions of economic and technical progress.  This strikes a responsive chord with anyone following the present election campaign.  But the author is guilty of a personal bias himself.  <i>Entropy</i> is clearly pitched at the industrialized Northeast and Trilateral Commission types.  Rifkin says frugality no longer exists in our \"high-entropy society\"; he contends that leisure has o verrun the work ethic; and in our mechanical, materialist value system, we have forsaken the pursuit of spiritual consciousness:</span></p> <p><span>Only the entropy paradigm provides a scythe that is both sharp enough to cut through the tangled debris of this death-bound culture and broad enough to clear a path for the dawn of a new age.</span></p> <p><span>The author's fervor recalls Ronald Reagan's recent pronouncements, and Rifkin completely ignores the reaction to this decadence, this high-entropy--the resurgence of a moral majority and the advent of a strong right in American politics.  Reagan's followers seem to prescribe the \"low-entropy society Rifkin craves.</span></p> <p><span>Much of the problem with <i>Entropy</i> is trying to discern anything new in the theory.  Certainly the idea that progress in history does not exist has been around for a while--Henry Kissinger '50, for example, wrote an undergraduate thesis on the subject.  As a genuine social democrat and a favorite of the left, Rifkin backs himself into a corner with his entropic world view.  Why should we accept his <i>weltanschaung</i> instead of Plato's?  What do we have to gain by accepting Rifkin's view when, as he says, progress is impossible?  The author's blend of cold reality and passionate rhetoric does not sway us.  Instead, he leaves us hanging, frustrated by unfulfilled expectations.  Although <i>Entropy</i> tries to respond to our daily malaise with a forceful theory, it leaves us even more despondent.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Responsible Intelligence | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b>F THE Carter Administration has its way, America's intelligence community will seize the recent resurgence of military fervor to wriggle out of unwelcome Congressional and public restraints.  Carter paints the effort to clothe intelligence agencies in responsibility as a straitjacket that will hamper our intrepid intelligence-gatherers from carrying out their duties in an era of deepening danger to American security.  The president is now pushing not just to limit Congressional oversight of intelligence activities but to legalize and codify a whole range of \"acceptable\" practices that threaten both domestic civil rights and foreign sovereignty.</span></p> <p><span>After Congressional reports of the mid-'70s showed exhaustively how an unrestrained intelligence community not only repeatedly violated American and foreign freedoms but also failed to deliver good information to American leaders, no one could doubt the need to charter the various intelligence agencies.  But in today's over-charged atmosphere, Carter has decided that \"flexibility\" must come first, accountability second.  He is pressing senators to pass charters that would allow intelligence agencies to use journalists, academics, and clergymen as agents, and reduce the number of types of covert operations agencies that must report to oversight committees.</span></p> <p><span>Several senators, including Daniel P. Moynihan (D-N.Y.), have proposed making it a crime for officials to disclose the names of intelligence agents or for private persons, including journalists, to do so with intent to harm intelligence activities.  Senate sources say there is even support for explicitly permitting agents to burglarize Americans' homes or to open their mail if they are suspected to have \"positive intelligence\" about foreign governments.</span></p> <p><span>Particularly disturbing is Carter's call to exempt the Central Intelligence Agency from some provisions of the (1974) Freedom of Information Act, to allow citizens to request information only about themselves.  Revelations of CIA misconduct have come not from such personal inquiries but from the general requests the act permits, and without them the public will be even less able to find out whether its intelligence agencies are obeying the law.</span></p> <p><span>If the Senate thinks before it acts it will reject Carter's requests and continue to seek effective, responsible restraints on intelligence activities.  Intelligence agencies have a legitimate need to gather information, but all covert operations should be subjected to rigorous oversight by Congress, and the public should have the legal right to receive information about intelligence activities.</span></p> <p><span>What politicians in Congress and the White House do today to exploit the current mood of public frustration will otherwise return to haunt American foreign policy for decades to come, the way the mistakes of the past decades have created our current predicament.

{"title": "The Folks on the Hill | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>N</b>OT EVERYONE is marveling at George Bush's transformation into a legitimate contender for the Republican nomination.  Many respected political analysts view the Texan's highly publicized success in the infant campaign as the confirmation of a trend threatening to change the way candidates sell themselves to the public.</span></p> <p><span>At a recent conference on the primary system and the press held at the Kennedy School of Government, James Wooten of ABC described one presidential hopeful in the 1976 campaign who \"seemed willing to discuss the issues, when in reality, he discussed no issues at all.\"  Jimmy Carter was elected anyway.</span></p> <p><span>Rep. David A. Stockman (R-Mich.), another participant at the conference, spoke of a \"new phenomenon\" in presidential politics:  the candidate who combines an obscure record with a chummy, non-committal image designed to offend no one.  Stockman calls his prototype the \"Bush/- Carter-type candidate.\"</span></p> <p><span>What these and other experts see is the emergence of a new breed of populist candidate, who despite the complicated and potentially dangerous foreign and domestic issues facing the United States, wins because he fits in so well on Main Street.</span></p> <p><span>The Carter we knew in 1976 worked tirelessly to create this image, and with surprising speed, Bush has shed his upper-class prep school heritage and established the same bland, folksy reputation.  <i>Time</i> described him recently as \"likeable, decent, a fine man.\"</span></p> <p><span>But the packaging of the modern populist goes beyond the early morning family jogs memorialized on the cover of <i>Newsweek.</i>  What Carter had in 1976 and Bush has in 1980 is a young, enthusiastic organization that started early in Iowa and capitalized on that state's affection for down-to-earth, visible politicians.  After Iowa, the press blessed Carter with its bewitching potion, momentum.  Bush now tastes the same nectar.  In fact, he chortles that he has cornered the market on the stuff.</span></p> <p><span>Although he has retained an effective crew of strategists, Carter has long since adjusted his image to include such twists as his current favorite, the hard-headed protecter of American dignity.  As president, he has also sacrificed two populist advantages that he capitalized on in 1976:  no clear record on national issues and no association with the incumbent administration.</span></p> <p><span>Because of his clean slate, Carter was able to run a campaign based on abused half-issues such as the ills of the Washington establishment and the need for efficiency and integrity in the executive branch.</span></p> <p><span>Bush has a similar opportunity.  He has served as director of the Central Intelligence Agency, chairman of the Republican National Committee and official liason to China, but his elected experience includes only an unspectacular four years in Congress.  Bush can and does shift from moderate to conservative rhetoric, depending on who is listening, because he has no voting record or recent link to official policy.</span></p> <p><span>Widely considered a flexible man who stands somewhere in the middle of the road, Bush actually follows a standard Republican line which leans heavily to the right.  He favors measures such as a large-scale tax cut, which helps business as much as the consumer, and strict cutbacks in federal spending.</span></p> <p><span>The media played a large role in establishing both Carter and Bush as competitors after they won the first round in Iowa.  The two men benefited from the upset factor:  the press loves to champion an underdog who comes out on top.  A Carter or a Bush attracts the media because his pitch is geared toward images, which are easily captured on film, not specific issues that often bore and confuse voters who are not directly affected.</span></p> <p><span>When the candidate does venture a stand, he often does so primarily to adjust his media image.  For example, when Bush denounces the registration of firearms, he not only gains the support of the boys down at the rifle club, but also adds an important conservative brush stroke to his self-portrait.  Journalists can further muddle the hazy relationship between issues and images by failing themselves to differentiate between the two.</span></p> <p><span>Bush exploits this confusion for all it's worth.  Cultivating a moderate stand on foreign policy, he scoffs at the idea of sending American troops to the Middle East to protect our interests there.  Yet he defended the concept of \"winning\" a nuclear war against the Soviets in an interview with Robert Scheer of the Los Angeles Times.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE PRESS has generally neither questioned this mixture of stances nor forced Bush to distinguish himself from his fellow Republicans on domestic issues.  The media can thus take credit for helping Bush maintain his reputation as a man with whom anyone can agree.  The whole scene recalls journalists' failure to pursue Carter's cliche-ridden spiel in 1976, when they opted instead to concentrate on his image as a fresh face, untainted by big time national politics and, of course, Watergate.</span></p> <p><span>David A. Keene, Bush's political strategist, sees no relationship between the two campaigns and insists that his man \"has been talking about the issues as much or more than anyone else, but that is not the public perception.\"  It is the public perception, however, that counts on election day.</span></p> <p><span>Republicans are switching to Bush because they trust him, the way Democrats trusted Carter in 1976.  Bush does not present a new voice or innovative solutions to the nation's problems, but his ill-defined dependability may prove irresistible to voters.</span></p> <p><span>We were still recovering from the shame of the Nixon years in 1976; Carter's \"believe in me\" gambit has some relevance.  His reliance on hazy populism does not merit praise, but at least it made sense at the time.  Unfortunately, the next president will not lead us through the impending gloom of rising energy prices and international military gamesmanship with trustworthiness.  Republicans, nonetheless, seem eager at this early point in the campaign to make Carter's successful but politically counter-productive strategy work for Bush.

{"title": "Young Americans | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>N</b>OSTALGIA IS DANGEROUS.  Perhaps disco or the decreasing number of minor league baseball players are responsible, but the collective psyche of the young generation disturbs many older concerned citizens.  Gazing toward a rosy, if hazy, past, they focus on World War II, remembering fondly the unity of spirit and pride in nationhood.  If only that spirit could return, if only, as President Carter instructed, we could \"say something good about America.\"  The answer, some say, is National Service, to revive our recalcitrant souls.</span></p> <p><span>The idea of National Service had been simmering in Washington for some time when the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan prompted the new interest in reviving the draft.  The combination of the two creates a disquieting alliance between a chunk of the liberal establishment, who want so badly to feel <i>good</i> about America again, and right-wing hawks, who ache to show some old-fashioned American muscle at some corner of the globe.  Drafting young people will satisfy both.</span></p> <p><span>The most widely publicized endorsement of National Service came in a 1979 study called <i>Youth and the Needs of the Nation,</i> a Ford Foundation-financed effort, co-chaired by Jacqueline Grennan Wexler, former president of Hunter College, and Harris Wofford, long time Kennedy associate, former president of Bryn Mawr, and, like Wexler, a pillar of the liberal community.  The report calls for engaging \"a million or more young people in a new system of voluntary National Service designed to help meet this country's non-military needs.\"  Though the report's conclusion calls for a \"voluntary\" program, it repeatedly cites the advantages of a mandatory system, and how one might work better than the voluntary program.  Specifics on what these people might do are spare, but there are several mentions of laudable goals like \"caring for the sick and the elderly\" and \"repairing our abused physical environment.\"</span></p> <p><span>According to the report, the nation should say to its youth, \"We need you and ask you--along with all other young people--to serve your community and country in demanding and disciplined work on some of the important problems of our society.\"  Stirring words, meant to refute conservatives' accusations that liberals prefer hand-outs to self help.  But this joint venture of rich and poor, white and black for a year or two of their lives will not alter economic inequities; liberals have again overestimated the efficiency of government programs.</span></p> <p><span>The report, reeking good intentions, was composed in the dreamland of a think tank, and it programs, VISTA for domestic projects and the Peace Corps for foreign.  About 9600 people participate in those projects now, with no signs of an immediate increase in sight.  The authors surely know this, but they presumably feared the reaction of young people to what they really wanted:  compulsory service.</span></p> <p><span><b>C</b>OMPULSORY NON-MILITARY service is a misguided attempt to force-feed patriotism.  Goals like \"caring for the sick and the elderly\" sound admirable on paper, but how would these programs actually work?  How would nurses' unions react to this intrusion of essentially unpaid labor into their turf?  How would construction workers' unions react to volunteers building \"facilities for the handicapped,\" or for \"waste treatment and recycling?\"  Furthermore, the Wexlers and the Woffords ignore a fundamental ideal while struggling to revive others:  freedom of choice.  The youth of this nation are no less moral than others, despite their lack of enthusiasm for do-good voluntarism.  This nation had a draft for only 30 of its 204 years and patriotism survived undaunted; until now no one has said that a one or two-year sacrifice to the nation was required for developing that spirit.</span></p> <p><span>President Carter has mingled the interest in a National Service with his disturbing draft registration proposal, carefully remaining on safe political ground.  He calls the present situation in Afghanistan \"the most serious threat to world peace since World War II,\" knowing full well no one wants to be seen as treating a threat to national security lightly.  The more dangerous the crisis, the less effective his opposition.  By asking for registration, he has made the crisis seem that much more serious.  He awakens images of steely American resolve and warns grimly that America must stand firm.</span></p> <p><span><b>H</b>AWKS LIKE Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) love it.  For Nunn and those with similar beliefs, Carter's tough line reminds them of an America whose embassies were treated with respect (or fear), whose foreign policy was determined from a position of strength, and whose influence usually determined the course of world events.</span></p> <p><span>Our declining strength abroad comes not from insufficient numbers of troops, but from continuing dependence on nations whose future we cannot control.  No longer will sending in the Marines contribute significantly to our national security; young people should not have to pay for this defunct vision of the world.</span></p> <p><span>Both of these plans--National Service from the left and the draft from the right--look to the nation's youth to gratify nostalgic fantasy.  Their authors demand that this generation give their time or perhaps their lives to projects obsolete at birth.  Working to improve the nation is fine if the methods will work.  National Service, conceived in altruism and probably executed in a festival of pork barrel and waste, will not correct the social ills disturbing the liberals.  Forcing 18- to 20-year-olds to spend a year or two in the military will not erase the damage done to our position in the world from years of immoral foreign policy and economic abuses.  Yet the nation calls on its youth to atone for those mistakes.</span></p> <p><span>Young Americans would undoubtedly come to the aid of their nation if it faced a genuine threat to its security.  But young people will not, and should not, march into the street or overseas to help their elders recapture the failed crusades of their youth.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Leaping Hurdles | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>HE TORCH is at Lake Placid.  They carried it all the way from Olympia for the first time in the history of American Olympic Games, and nobody would have known the difference if they had lit it with a bic.  But the authenticity of the Olympic tradition--and the universal respect that this tradition elicits, has suddenly been threatened by the United States.  The Olympics are an endangered species--a venerated institution that represents more than athletic competition.</span></p> <p><span>The Olympic torch, and all that it symbolizes, should not be exploited to make a political statement or to strengthen our foreign policy.  Yet President Carter demands that we boycott the summer Games in Moscow not only for the symbolic significance of such a stand, but also to hurt the Soviet economy and wound their pride.  By not participating in the Games, he hopes to make an international statement of our condemnation of their occupation of Afghanistan (and also of the way that they treat dissidents), yet it is doubtful this statement will have any effect on the USSR.  When Vladimir Pozner, a Soviet radio commentator, was asked about the boycott, he replied that if we were trying to punish the USSR by boycotting the Olympics, we would fail.  The Soviet Union, like the United States, is too proud and too powerful to be punished in such a way, Pozner said.</span></p> <p><span>But the argument in favor of a boycott has gone beyond the hopes of wounding the Kremlin, and the most optimistic Americans hope to reach the general public of the Soviet Union--illustrating the Western disapproval of Soviet aggression through absence at the summer Games.  Even if we were successful in rallying the support of all other Western countries, we could not successfully \"reach\" the Soviets.  If they were successfully deceived as to why tens of thousands of troops moved into Afghanistan, they can certainly be deceived as to why tens of thousands of troops moved into Afghanistan, they can certainly be deceived as to why the West did not participate in their Olympics.  We cannot expect Soviet citizens to experience a revelation when they arrive at the Games only to find no Westerners there.</span></p> <p><span>In addition to not having its intended effect, a United States boycott may mean a regression to cold war relations between East and West.  Since 1969, steadily improving relations have given rise to new trade, loans and tourism between East and West, as well as a trend toward westernization.  Several members of the Soviet bloc have relaxed political restraints on individual liberties, showing greater toleration of expression and worship than exists in the Soviet Union.  These nations, especially Poland, conceive of themselves as bridges between East and West and do not want to break ties with the United States.  Unfortunately, a boycott might force them to revert to subordination within the Soviet system.</span></p> <p><span>Although the boycott will guarantee a deterioration of our relations with the Eastern bloc, we have no assurance that the Soviets will interpret it as a unified Western reaction because our allies have expressed extreme reluctance to stand by us.</span></p> <p><span>Margaret Thatcher of Great Britain has declared that she will stand by the United States' decision, but a Paris meeting of officials from Great Britain, France and West Germany, Britain changed the essence of this support when Lord Carrington stated that he would like to take a stand apart from that of the United States.</span></p> <p><span>These three Western allies met last week to discuss the Soviet Union's intervention in Afghanistan and to develop a common position with other Western European countries.  \"It would be a mistake to assume that the reaction of each country be the same.  The West should sing in harmony but not in unison,\" Carrington said.  The United States should be prepared to stand alone because although Western countries are now expressing their support for the United States' position, they are also exercising extreme reluctance as to whether or not they will boycott.  While France and West Germany have condemned the Soviet military intervention, they have not guaranteed they will participate in an American-led boycott.  At present, the boycott is an American act which will be read by the Soviets as a symbolic gesture of nationalism, a product of Carter's campaign passion rather than a unified Western reaction to Soviet aggression.</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>HILE INVOKING a boycott to demonstrate our disapproval of Soviet violations of human rights, we ourselves breach the rights of our athletes.  Those who will compete on our national team have sacrificed scholastics and career options in order to train for these Olympics.  Since the United States does not support our athletes until they have made the national team, they must pay the expenses of training and traveling that are necessary when aspiring to reach Olympic competition.  These individuals not only sweat through grueling training, but also suffer the financial woes of supporting themselves.  The U.S. has developed a system in which the struggle to make the Olympic team is an individual one.  It is inconsistent to expect a sudden and overwhelming sense of national unity or a rush of patriotism to induce them to support a boycott.</span></p> <p><span>Even more importantly, it is unjust to single out this strain of Americans to carry the national burden especially when the situation will not be resolved through such a course of action.</span></p> <p><span>The effectiveness of Carter's request for a boycott is dubious--the consequences should not be tolerated.  In August 1980, the flame from Olympia will be in Moscow--so should the U.S. Olympic Team.</span></p>"}

Dave Burke added an empty-net marker at 19:55 as the icemen notched their eighth third-place Beanpot finish.</span></p> <p><span>With the teams tied at three goals apiece and 12:53 left in regulation, defenseman Fusco beat B.U. goalie Jeff Weisman with--what else--a slapshot from the point.  A Greg Britz wrist shot followed a minute later to make it 5-3, Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>B.U. center Mark Fidler closed the gap to 5-4 at 13:52, but the Terriers' well-documented Beanpot magic had departed a week earlier.</span></p> <p><span>Not that either team came out roaring.</span></p> <p><span>There's something about an acute shortage of fans that puts the brakes on Beanpot competition, and both the Terriers and the Crimson started sluggishly as the sound of scraping skates echoed through the sparsely-populated Garden.</span></p> <p><span>After 11:08 of ambivalent play, highlighted when B.U. left wing Grant Goegan missed an open net, Murray became the first upperclassman to score for the Crimson in three games.  Taking a set-up from Fusco at the blue line, Murray took his time and waited for Weisman to make the first move before slipping the puck by on the short side.</span></p> <p><span>Neither squad could break through as the faithful streamed in and the tempo picked up until 9:13 of period two, when left wing Daryl MacLeod, last year's tournament MVP, neatly tipped a pass to linemate Paul Miller between Hynes's pads to knot the game at one.</span></p> <p><span>Freshman Jim Turner retaliated for Harvard 1:12 later, converting Greg Olson's precision cross-cease feed for his fifth goal of the year.</span></p> <p><span>But the 2-1 advantage proved short-lived as Terrier captain Tony Meagher blasted a loose puck through Hynes from five feet out with 7:15 to go in the middle session.</span></p> <p><span>The third period began much like the first, with neither team taking the initiative.  With both sides ostensibly intent on prolonging their less than emotion-filled encounter into overtime, Harvard's Greg Olson and B.U.'s Fidler traded tallies at 5:44 and 6:28 to keep the contest even at 3-3.

William Miller was named to head the Federal Reserve Board, he testified he had tried to run a \"super clean\" company during his 22 years as an executive of Textron, Inc.  An investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) suggests Miller, now Secretary of the Treasury, may have soiled his hands while working for Textron.</span></p> <p><span>The SEC contends, first, that Textron made $5.4 million in improper payments in 10 countries, largely to government officials, between 1971 and 1979.  It says unnamed Textron officials falsified records and lied to a Senate committee to cover up the payments, which were made by a division Miller supervised before he became the company's chairman in 1974.  Second, the SEC alleges Textron often overbilled customers, remitting them the difference under the table.  Finally, the SEC charges Textron with spending $600,000 to \"entertain\" Defense Department employees illicitly and without normal substantiation in company records.</span></p> <p><span>On two separate occasions Miller told shareholders there had been no improper or illegal payments.  The SEC calls these statements \"erroneous and misleading,\" and says they were \"made by the chairman without his having a reasonable basis.\"  In addition, the SEC accuses Miller of knowing about the concealed expenses on the Defense Department accounts.</span></p> <p><span>While conceding he failed to prevent improper payments, Miller denies having had any knowledge of them, and he points to explicit orders he issued against such practices.  No one has clearly proved that Miller knew or took part in the payments.

{"title": "John Birch Society:  Cranky Adolescence | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The American flag never comes down at 395 Concord Ave. in Belmont.  Illuminated at night and resilient through foul weather, the Stars and Stripes provides the only glint of color near the bleak rectangle of red bricks.  This is a decidedly no-nonsense building, surrounded by an equally no-nonsense post office and public library.  No doubt about it, there is work to be done at the national headquarters of the John Birch Society, 12 minutes from Harvard Square.</span></p> <p><span>Few topics prompt more immediate-and impassioned-responses than the John Birch Society.  Reactionary.  Ultra-right wing.  Anti fluoridation.  But almost no one seems to know how these associations came to exist.  The answer goes back to a single book, a single angry man and his cause.</span></p> <p><span>*****</span></p> <p><span>In 1957, Robert Welch was fed up.  He had enjoyed a successful 25-year career as an executive at the James O.Welch Company (his brother founded the Cambridge candy-making firm), but that couldn't contain the concern that was gnawing at him: Communism.</span></p> <p><span>Welch decided to do something about it.</span></p> <p><span>He wrote a book-later he said it was only an \"unfinished manuscript,\" the contents of which were leaked by unscrupulous reporters-that began to explain the subversive and destructive forces at work in his country.  The thesis of the \"manuscript\" <i>The Politician, </i> now in its ninth printing with more than 285,000 copies in print, is startling:  \"Dwight D. Eisenhower was, through his whole career, a dedicated, conscious agent of the Communist conspiracy,\" and was guilty of treason.</span></p> <p><span>Twenty-three years later, Welch says in a prologue that \"Obvious pressures to smother and ignore <i>The Politician </i> since its official publication are unmatched in the history of the book world.\"  That statement's glaring hyperbole runs through the next 287 pages.  The book contains no apparent factual errors, only mind-boggling leaps of imagination, including only evidence that suits his conclusion.  Not surprisingly in a 1957 atmosphere still charged with the remnants of McCarthyism, the book caused a considerable stir.</span></p> <p><span>Welch decide he needed a long-term outlet for his views, so on December 9, 1959, in Indianapolis, Ind., Welch and 11 friends founded the John Birch Society.  John Birch was a young Baptist preacher who had served as an Army captain in China during World War II.  Chinese Communists had killed him ten days after the Japanese surrendered, and Birch was, according to Welch, \"the first American to die in World War III.\"  The society's basic philosophy holds that \"The world is engaged in this war from which either Communism or Christian-style civilization must emerge with one completely triumphant and the other completely destroyed.\"</span></p> <p><span>*****</span></p> <p><span>Of all the right-wing organizations in the United States-the Liberty Lobby, the Rev. Carl McIntire's Twentieth Century Reformation Hour, the Rev. Billy James Hargis's Manion Forum-Welch managed to build the only one with a broad base of popular support.  The John Birch Society quickly jumped to about 50,000 members, and John F. McManus, director of public relations, says membership since then has remained between 50,000 and 100,000.</span></p> <p><span>The secret to the society's longevity lies in the simplicity of its message and its diligence in spreading the word.  Communists, or their minions, are working to see the \"Christian style civilization\" buried under Marx's big boot.  But Birch Communism has almost nothing to do with Marx; \"Communist\" for the society is simply an adjective, a pejorative applied to any form of government control.  John Birchers have a nearly pathological fear of government control; the line blurrs between traffic lights and the abolition of private property, both forms of governmental intrusion into people's lives.  It is nostalgia tempered with paranoia.  Publications like \"The Glorification of M. L. King-A Victory for World Communism,\" show their confusion between real Communism, and any threat to the society's world inside 395 Concord Ave.. a place Peter Schrag called \"hermetic reality.\"</span></p> <p><span>The John Birch Society owns three building sin Belmont, two of them devoted entirely to the Birch publishing empire.  In addition to a monthly Birch Society Bulletin, which 80-years-old Welch still writes, and a weekly reactionary news analysis magazine called <i>The Review of the News,</i> the society publishes hundreds of pamphlets like \"McCarthy:  The Truth, the Smear and the Lesson.\" and \"They killed the President : Lee Harvey Oswald Wasn't Alone,\" (Surprise, he had help from Communists).  The society also runs Western Island Press, publishers of conservative tracts like \"Teddy Bare: The Last of the Kennedy Clan,\" an attack on the Senator's performance at Chappaquiddick.  To complete the distribution system, the society sells its books and magazines at about 350 American Opinion bookstores, many of them in southern California.  \"We do our own publicity,\" McManus says.  \"That boils them in oil.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Them,\" \"They\" are the Opposition, those dedicated to the end of \"Christian-style civilization.\"  Society publications usually call them \"the Insiders,\" a form of shorthand.  No one ever clarifies, however, who \"they\" are.  Several recent publications offered the following villains:  Jimmy Carter, homosexuals, the Trilateral Commission, the CIA, the big oil companies, the Democratic Party, the Ford Foundation, the Council on Foreign Relations, and most of all, the United Nations.  The society itself.  McManus points to a huge stack and says these are among the eight million petitions he has ready for distribution with the aim of removing the United States from that world body.</span></p> <p><span>The early and mid-'60s saw the society's heyday; <i>Life,</i>, in its \"Washington Report,\" said the society was engaged in \"a massive shift from a semi-clandestine political guerilla force to a quasi-respectable pressure group,\" devoted mostly to withdrawal from the U.N., exposure of the civil rights \"fraud,\" and the impeachment of Chief Justice Earl Warren.  Then Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy '48 placed the group \"in the area of being humorous.\"  But Sen. Barry Goldwater (RAriz.), in a comment that would haunt him in his presidential bid, said, \"I am impressed by the people in it.\"</span></p> <p><span>However, Republicans fought the society from the start.  Former vice president and future unsuccessful California gubernatorial candidate Richard M. Nixon said on the Jack Parr Show in February 1962, that politicians \"who accept or seek support of organizations like the John Birch Society are not serving America.\" William F. Buckley Jr., in the <i>National Review,</i> revealed Welch's isolation in the conservative movement, calling <i>The Politician </i>\" paranoid and unpatriotic drivel.\"</span></p> <p><span>The beginning of the end of the society's national prominence came in 1965, when the Republican Party steering committee, still smarting from the Goldwater \"extremism in the defense of liberty\" fiasco, condemned Welch and his group.  Welch had offended nearly everyone by then, especially with his call for complete and unilateral American withdrawal from Vietnam in 1965.  By Welch's peculiar reasoning, Communists were running both sides of the war, and the United States was paying for it.  A last gasp of attention came in the late '60s, as a result of a campaign more renowned for its slogan than its effect, \"Support Your Local Police.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"What is Communism but total government control?\"  McManus asks honestly ignorant of any answer.  Every political issue fits into the government/Communist control spectrum.  \"Are you aware that one of the planks of the Communist Manifesto is free public education?\"  he inquires with a smile.  \"You don't have a right to an education.\"  He smiles some more when he describes how the society is spreading the good word:  the speakers bureau is the second largest in the country(only Sports Illustrated's is bigger) and schedule people like ex-Marine hero Lewis Millett to expound the society line on grueling month-long tours of duty.</span></p> <p><span>*****</span></p> <p><span>Since the mid-'60s, the society's has been a prosaic; if mildly prosperous, existence.  With little turnover in membership, about 200 people constantly work in Belmont, the western headquarters in San Marino, Calif., and in the field.  A council whose members include former New Hampshire Gov. Meldrim Thompson and Bunker Hunt, of the Texas oil family, raised and administer an 58 million budget that has not changed in about five years.  The latest major project is something called TRIM, Tax Reform Immediately, an organization of local pamphleteers who rate their congressman by his stands on raising taxes.  Far from extremist, TRIM fits right into the Republican mainstream-more Howard Jarvis than Robert Welch.</span></p> <p><span>Yet the John Birch Society will never work into the mainstream, never become acceptable.  Defeat has been welded on their faces as clearly as anti-Communism has been grafted into their hearts.  They know that the public's conception of their organization is a lunatic fringe of the right wingers.  No matter how moderate the society s stands on specific issues, that image will remain.</span></p> <p><span>In a sense, though, the John Birch Society likes it that way.  its public image allows the society the smugness available only to someone who knows he will never have to test his theories, never have to put his hide on the line.  The folks at 395 Concord Ave. revel in their ideological purity, knowing-like the Spartacus Youth League and the Revolutionary Communist Party know-that they will never have any power, so they will never have to take responsibility.  They're untouchable.</span></p> <p><span>I'm not paranoid,\" McManus says, laughing.  \"They are chasing me.\"</span></p>"}

Only two of those games are at home, however, so the icemen are still a long jump away.</span></p> <p><span>The scoring began at 16:00 of the second when Tom Murray scooped up a loose puck in his own zone and raced the length of the ice, flicking the puck past a sprawling Dennis.</span></p> <p><span>Before rink announcer John Phillips could wet his lips, the red light shone again as Dave Burke took a Murray pass and converted it into his seventh goal of the season a mere five seconds later.</span></p> <p><span><b>You're Dead</b></span></p> <p><span>The bang-bang goals tamed the charging Tigers, and for the remainder of the game they were unable to control play for more than a few moments at a time.</span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile, the Crimson calmly added three more goals:  Mike Watson from Greg Olson and Jim Turner at 18:30, Pete Evans from Murray and Graham Carter at 4:21 of the third, and Fusco's 11th from Carter and Bobby McDonald with 14:58 remaining.</span></p> <p><span>The icemen controlled play during the last 30 minutes with crisp passes and tenacious forechecking.  Although Harvard played without defensemen Mitch Olson (flu) and Scott Sangster (leg injury), the blueliners managed to avoid the jam-ups in front of the cage that had plagued past outings.</span></p> <p><span>The Crimson opened the game with spirited, if sloppy, play, using a dump-and-run offense instead of patterned passing.</span></p> <p><span>\"The dump-and-run was not by design,\" coach Billy Clearly said after the game.  'The guys were a little leery of stickhandling at first, so they just dumped it in; but when we got going we played much better hockey.  The passing game is our game,\" he added.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard's best opportunity to score in the opening frame came when Tigers Todd Hewitt and Grant Hansen slunk to the penalty box together at 16:50 to serve two minutes each for slashing and hooking, respectively.</span></p> <p><span>Unlike their first power play opportunity minutes earlier, the icemen came out firing, peppering Dennis with four shots within 40 seconds.  But the freshman netminder, setting up perfectly for every shot, limited his acrobatics but increased his efficiency to the point of excellence, repulsing every one.  The Tigers slipped away unscathed.</span></p>"}

{"title": "In Sheep's Clothing | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>P</b>ICTURE A CONGRESSMAN who voted for the Kemp-Roth tax bill, which would have cut personal tax rates by a third, who voted against the Common Situs Picket bill, the most important piece of labor legislation in ten years, who supported the Vietnam war through the 1960s and who was elected by his GOP peers to the chairmanship of the House Republican Conference.</span></p> <p><span>A <i>New York Times</i> editorial about this man appeared under the headline, \"Why Not the Best?\"  and Times columnist Tom Wicker calls him the \"Idea man from Illinois.\"  Of late, he has not been so much covered as celebrated by the press.  Phrases like \"golden-tongued orator,\" and \"impeccable liberal credentials\" have been pinned to him like Olympic medals.  The Massachusetts branch of Americans for Democratic Action last month welcomed him like one of their own.</span></p> <p><span>His name is Rep. John B. Anderson (R-Ill.)  and he's running for President.</span></p> <p><span>Anderson is, by all accounts, a decent man, a distinguished and reasonable conservative, one of the few remaining.  But the press has transformed him into something called a \"liberal alternative,\" something he is not.</span></p> <p><span>The district Anderson represents is American heartland, the northwest corner of Illinois, where the farming is good and the biggest city, Rockford, has a population of 272,000.  Anderson has been the Congressman here since 1960, and he has served his constituents and party well.</span></p> <p><span>Anderson moves by the same sensible and unchanging ideals by which the farmers in his district have lived for decades.  Don't spend more than you have, don't have the government poking its nose in places where it shouldn't be, let the forces of supply and demand determine most of what goes on in our lives, and everything will settle just fine.  The problem is the ideas that work on the farm do not necessarily make for the best government.</span></p> <p><span>An examination of Anderson's record reveals a conservative with a conscience, but a conservative first and foremost.  The Jeffersonian creed that \"government that governs best governs least\" remains the operative phrase in Anderson's political vision.  Just put the money into the pockets of consumers and hence into the market system and the benefits will filter down to those in need.  It is a traditional doctrine, Adam Smith filtered through 200 years, but what was liberal in 1776 is liberal no more.</span></p> <p><span>The press confusion on Anderson's record is understandable, considering the oddities of the 1980 election year.  The Republican party has assembled the most reactionary array of candidates in at least 16 years.  The popularity of Howard Jarvis and the unpopularity of Leonid Brezhnev have propelled tax-cuts and Russian-baiting into consensus positions of the Right.  Further, the Jarvis epigones have labelled Great Society programs failures, and argue that their elimination or reduction would prove a convenient way to lower taxes.  And President Carter, Democrat, has acted more like a Republican than a member of the party that nominated him, leaving little room for an attack form a moderate Republican and forcing those who wish to be different to the far Right.  That is where you will find Baker, Bush, Crane, Dole and Reagan.  John Connally you will soon find sulking at his big Texas ranch.</span></p> <p><span>All of which leaves Anderson to inhabit the abandoned tundra of the Republican center.  And there he would have remained had not the press prematurely announced the death of Sen.  Edward M. Kennedy's candidacy, leaving many to search for a \"liberal alternative.\"</span></p> <p><span>In Anderson they found a man who supports the Panama Canal and SALT II treaties, gun control, the Equal Rights Amendment and some forms of school-busing, and who opposes the MX missile, B-1 bomber and selective service registration.  His record on civil rights has been particularly distinguished; it was his vote in April, 1968 that allowed President Johnson's open housing bill to get through the Rules Committee.  But on the economy, the domestic policy area over which a president has most direct control, Anderson remains a conservative, a man who believes a balanced budget is the primary goal of an economic policy.  He has withdrawn his support of Kemp-Roth; even his original support of such an irresponsible and dangerous a proposal, though, reveals the heart of a conservative.  Anderson's much touted trade-off of a 50-cent-per gallon tax for a 50-per-cent cut in Social Security taxes is an admirable gesture, but it remains gas rationing by price instead of need.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>NDERSON STANDS out as the class of the Republican field but he still belongs in it.  In his first six years in the House, the reactionary Americans for Constitutional Action gave him an average approval rating of 88 per cent.  His views have moderated since then, but even in the past three years, the AFL-CIO's committee on political education gave him an average rating of only 32 per cent, in part for his vote against the Common Situs bill, a measure that would have allowed unions with a greivance against one contractor to picket all the contractors on the same construction site.  There aren't many unions in northwestern Illinois.</span></p> <p><span>The death-wish of American progressives cannot be underestimated; liberals love an honest loser.  And by the same token, liberals all too often see reformers where none exist--witness Jimmy Carter, who teased with promises of reform, only to cast them off somewhere along his celebrated Inauguration Day walk to the White House.  Anderson lacks the cynicism to distort his record; the press has done it for him.  If the triumphant political product of 1980 turns out to be John Anderson, the package should be clearly marked.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Suffering a Change in Fashion | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>J</b>ERRY BROWN is no longer \"the sort of candidate who could be 20 points down in the polls of Friday, blitz the state over the weekend, and hand you your ass on Tuesday.\"  That's how one Carter aide described him in 1976, when Brown upset Jimmy Carter in five primaries.  Those victories, astounding for a man who had been governor of California barely six months, are now distant, almost absurd memories.</span></p> <p><span>A month ago Brown was so worried about the embarassing possibility of having a zero next to his name on television screens across the nation that he told his Iowa supporters to try to win election as uncommitted delegates.  And although Brown did manage to garner 11.5 per cent of the vote in Maine's caucuses this week, he was able to pick up only two delegates.  Brown's showing was respectable only in comparison to his pathetic performance earlier in the race.</span></p> <p><span>What is most surprising about Brown's precipitous decline is that it comes despite growing popular acceptance of the positions he has stressed--energy conservation, fiscal conservatism, a halt to the development of nuclear power, and, most recently, opposition to draft registration.  The once unorthodox blend of liberalism and conservatism that Brown was the first to champion has received increasing popular support; many of the candidates are now describing themselves as \"socially compassionate fiscal conservatives.\"  Still, Brown's campaign has yet to ignite, or even give off a spark.  The essence of his success in 1976--his unconventionality--has triggered his downfall in 1980.</span></p> <p><span>\"The first rule of politics is to be different,\" a veteran Brown aide remarked in 1976, when the campaign emphasized the exotic in his personality, capitalizing on people's interest in his outrageous lifestyle and philosophy.  The years of misty evocations of Zen consciousness, bachelor pad living, and inviting royalty to brown-bag lunches have taken their toll, however--the image of unorthodoxy that was Brown's greatest asset in 1976 has now become his chief liability.  Brown's campaign staff works furiously to dispel the conception of the governor as a \"California flake.\"</span></p> <p><span>Brown's aides concede that their candidate's poor performance results from what they anti-septically term an \"image problem.\" Pollster Lou Harris and his nationwide interviews show voters regard Brown as \"superficial\", \"opportunistic,\" \"unreliable,\" and \"flaky.\"  Americans perceive Brown, despite his mainstream politics, as so far beyond the bounds of the civic religion that he could never be nominated, let alone elected.  Recent events in California--the murder of two public officials in San Francisco cult in Guyana--have made the public far less indulgent of the stereotype of western eccentricity that Brown epitomizes.</span></p> <p><span>In an attempt to shake his West Coast image, Brown appears on the campaign trail in a pinstripe suit, brushing aside questions about the more unusual elements of his lifestyle.  Still, even those who respond favorably to Brown's opposition to nuclear power and military spending are confused by the barrage of bizarre terms with which Brown laces his speeches--\"Class 9 meltdowns,\" \"biomass conversion,\" \"photovoltaic generation,\" and \"holistic medicine.\"  And Brown, who is using rock concerts to bankroll his campaign, will never shake parts of his image:  one youth told a reporter that he came to a Brown rally only to \"see the man Linda Ronstadt dates.\"</span></p> <p><span>As in 1976, Brown is trying to tout himself as the anti-politics politician, describing his dark horse campaign as a \"frontal attack on the conventional wisdom of a dying political party.\"  Since the time he \"limited lobbyist spending to two hamburgers and a coke\" as California secretary of state, Brown has been perceived as a young reformer defying political convention.  This cherished image, though has undergone a radical metamorphosis.  From the anti-politician fighting politics as usual, Brown has come to be viewed as the consummate politician--a master puppeteer and ventriloquist who not only rehearses what he is going to say but also how to make it look unrehearsed.  Brown's political fickleness on Proposition 13 may have saved him a gubernatorial election at the price of deeply scarring his political future; in the words of West Coast journalist Mary Ellen Leary, he has been branded \"a surfer on every popular wave, a politician who veers to the current fad with an intuition as unerring as a heat-seeking missile on the hunt of its target.\"</span></p> <p><span>Jerry Brown's success in dealing with certain issues--energy and affirmative action--has done little to change a national reputation based largely on his personality and symbolic rejection of the prequisites of office.  Stressing trivia, he has become a master of the cosmetic solution--his new Plymouth cost more than the second-hand limousine he traded in.</span></p> <p><span>Brown's pronouncements often create an impression of false progress.  Political observer Richard Reeves relates the following exchange:</span></p> <p><span>\"I'm going to starve the schools financially until I get some educational reforms,\" Brown said.</span></p> <p><span>\"What reforms?  What do you want?\" asked the director of the California Teacher's Association.</span></p> <p><span>\"I don't know yet,\" Brown replies.</span></p> <p><span>Californians are wearying of a governor who has spent only two of the last four and a half years on the job.  In a ten day period last year, the legislature overrode three Brown vetoes, which former aide Jim Lorenz called \"unprecedented in California history.\" Republican Lt. Gov. Mike Curb drew national attention to Brown's absences last year, signing key legislation while Brown was on the campaign trial.</span></p> <p><span>But despite the well-publicized gaffes, few governors have matched Brown's record on the environment or affirmative action.  In his first term, Brown named over 1000 women, 300 Hispanics, and 200 blacks to state posts.  And Brown has shown imagination, proposing creative solutions conventional politicians would not even consider:  he sponsored a plan to underwrite physician's malpractice insurance in exchange for a guarantee of medical services to the poor, and demanded the same $65-a-month pay increase for all civil servants, janitors and judges alike.</span></p> <p><span>It is an oft-repeatead aphorism among his supporters that in the year 2000 Jerry Brown will be barely the age Ronald Reagan is today.  But by the year 2000 Brown may have run unsuccessfully for the presidency more times than Harold Stassen.  Americans may tremble at the thought of Jerry and Linda living together in the White House.  Still it is healthy, out in California, to have a politician who believes politics is more than merely \"art of the possible.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "THE MIDDLE EAST | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>For the moment, events in Iran and Afghanistan have diverted the attention of both the American public and administration from matters closer at hand:  the lack of substantive progress in the implementation of the Camp David accords, concluded between Egypt and Israel, with the U.S. as \"guarantor\" of sorts, and signed into treaty ten months ago in Washington.  While Egypt and Israel have limped along towards some kind of \"normalization\" of relations, little else has concealed the complete failure of any of the signatories to act decisively as regards the core issue in the Middle East--the continuing frustration of the Palestinians' aspirations for national self-determination.  Israel is the only possible exception to this; ongoing settlement of the West Bank, absorption of the West Bank electrical power system into Israel's, and continuing persecution of Palestinian political spokesmen (like Bassam Shak'a, Mayor of Nablus) may be seen as \"decisive acts.\"  Unfortunately, by telegraphing Israel's apparent intention of permanently retaining the West Bank (or at least of privileges there--to settlement, stationing of Israeli troops, etc.), these \"decisive acts\" render in advance any discussion of genuine political rights for the Palestinians utterly farcical.</span></p> <p><span>As the fragile equilibrium in the Middle East and Central Asia deteriorates, the position of the U.S. vis-a-vis these areas becomes ever more similar to that of the man faced with the task of holding a dam which is constantly springing new leaks.  Our approach has been to stuff these leaks with fistfuls of dollars, or arms, or both:  $2.2 billion as an initial installment on the Egyptian-Israeli treaty (Israel is dissatisfied with a $200 million increase over this in credits; President Carter is seeking congressional approval to send an additional $1.1 billion in arms aid to Egypt, while Sadat is asking for staggering sums to shore up the decrepit Egyptian economy).</span></p> <p><span>The fear that conservative Middle Eastern governments are experiencing because of Iran and Afghanistan may or may not give the U.S. much respite.  Dependent on the U.S. for security, countries like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait may press the U.S. less vigorously to respect Palestinian rights in the resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict, and may even respond positively to U.S. persuasion to finance with petrodollars the defense-spending of \"like-minded\" regimes in the area (e.g. Pakistan).  On the other hand, as the Arab royal families are perfectly aware, failure to press for Palestinian rights in peace negotiations and closer association with the U.S. are precisely the factors which will expose them to the kinds of attack to which they may be most vulnerable:  those impelled by some form of religious ideology.</span></p> <p><span>Given the contraction of the American economy, one wonders at what point one neglected leak will develop into a flood.  Consider, for example, the implications of a coup in Saudi Arabia, the potential for which was starkly revealed in the take-over of the Great Mosque in Mecca--or in Egypt, where expectations of rapid economic development following on the heels of peace with Israel have been irresponsibly fueled by the leadership.</span></p> <p><span>The answer to this is not, I would submit, a quantitative change in American foreign policy (i.e. increasing militarization of the region) as some in this country are advocating, but a qualitative change--something on the order of, to extend our previous analogy, draining the water from behind the dam.</span></p> <p><span>In the most general sense, a qualitatively different U.S. policy must begin with the fundamental realization that peoples of the Middle East (as no doubt in every other region of the world) will continue to struggle for what they perceive as their legitimate rights to political and economic freedom.  As long as the U.S. is seen as inhibiting the realization of such rights, we can expect to invite the antipathy of the peoples there.  Any attempt to prop up governments against their peoples is only a stop-gap measure, as Iran bears witness, and obversely, as Afghanistan is also likely to demonstrate at some point.  The retreat into Cold War logic, which views indigenous national struggles as indicative of \"communist influence,\" only leads to further alienation of peoples, whose rights are trampled in our headlong attempts at \"containment\"--a process which eventually creates the instability against which we sought initially to defend.  Instead, we must adopt as a general principle of our policy that equal opportunities to social economic, and political development--not military aid and alliances--are the most basic guarantees of stability in the Middle East, and indirectly of our own national interests in that region.</span></p> <p><span>The temporary lull in the Arab-Israeli conflict should not be mistaken for peace and stability.  With the ingredients of discontent left fermenting, it is only a matter of time before violence escalates again.  This devolution is not, however, inevitable.</span></p> <p><span>The application of our general principle to the specific case of the Arab-Israeli dispute has several ramifications.  Firstly, we must recognize that the Camp David formula, which treats the Palestinians as third party subsidiaries to a conflict in which they are principal protagonists, is fundamentally misconceived.  Secondly, we must help to initiate a new peace process in which the Palestinians are guaranteed in advance the satisfaction of their right as a people--no less than any other people, including Jewish Israelis--to national self-determination.  Moreover, this right must be extended to all Palestinians, whether in exile from their homeland, on the West Bank and Gaza, or in Israel.  Although my personal belief is that this must eventually be accomplished within the framework of a unitary, democratic, secular state in Palestine, that is a matter for the disputants of the conflict to settle.  Thirdly, and this follows from the above two points, the Palestinians must be represented in any negotiations pertaining to their future by the Palestine Liberation Organization, which, whether we like it or not, is the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinians.  Any other considerations (whether this should be done under U.N. auspices, in partnership with European nations, etc.) are subordinate to the above.</span></p> <p><span>Of course, the general principle that we should back peoples rather than governments does not offer any precise guidelines for policy makers dealing with immediate crises like Afghanistan.  On the other hand, its implementation should diminish the likelihood of our continually facing \"Afghanistans;\" that is, constantly having to \"react' to situations which are already well beyond our control.  If beginning with the Arab-Israeli conflict seems overly ambitious, this is justified by the gravity and potential dangers of that particular situation at the real level, and by the fact that at the symbolic level, the value in the Arab and Muslim worlds of U.S. recognition and demonstration of sincere respect for Palestinian national rights would be immeasurable.  However, Carter's State of the Union comments on the Middle East seem not to foreshadow a positive policy at all, but only the old reactives behind-the-eight-ball U.S. policy writ large.</span></p> <p><span>The adoption of this type of new policy is not now and never has been easy, principally because of general American public sympathy for Israel, because of the activities of a well-organized and powerful pro-Israeli lobby in Washington--and perhaps most importantly, due to the prevalence within government and military circles of a \"strategic\" mentality, which saw Iran and Israel as surrogates to American military power in the Middle East.</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately, if predictably, this line of thinking survives by the tenuous argument that the billions of dollars of arms we sold to the government of the Shah, Israel's and our training of Savak and other military personnel, 40,000 American technicians and \"consultants\" working for our military or private corporations on contract to the Shah, and no doubt substantial covert CIA activities as well--all of these were somehow \"insufficient,\" and we erred in Iran only by not supporting the Shah more fully!</span></p> <p><span>Neither do the upcoming presidential elections promise to resolve anything; Democratic candiates are heavily dependent on pro-Israeli constituencies, and Republican candidates are the neo-Crusaders of militarization of the middle East.  Whether the productive initiatives of some members of the American black community to raise the issue of Palestinian rights continue and expand remains to be seen.</span></p> <p><span>No doubt the political costs of re-orienting U.S. policy in the Middle East would be great for any American politician.  Nevertheless, it appears that these political costs can only mount; this in a period when our capacities to effectuate policy change appear to be diminishing.  Equally certain is that these political costs, whatever they are and whoever pays them, would be dwarfed by the costs to this nation if such necessary changes continue to be sacrificed to short-term and personal (or other particular) political objectives.</span></p> <p><span><i>George E.

{"title": "Carter to Cities:  Drop Dead | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>L</b>AST DECEMBER, Ted Kennedy whisked his campaign into the Big Apple pointing out that President Carter had turned \"thumbs down on the people of New York...I believe that 12 long years of Republican administrations is enough,\" shouted the senator from the stump, \"and it's time we elected a real democrat.\"  Amazingly, Senator Kennedy understated his case against the president.  Judged by government aid to cities.  the Carter years have not been as bad as the Nixon-Ford era; they've been worse.  Between 1968 and 1976, while Republicans ruled in the White House, Federal aid to New York City nearly doubled.  Since Carter took office in 1977, however, aid has fallen by a total of 11 per cent.</span></p> <p><span>The case of New York underlines the most blatant broken promise of the Carter administration.  A \"New Deal\" coalition of urban blue collar workers and inner-city blacks put Carter over the top in 1976.  Almost 19 out of 20 black Americans voted for the former governor of Georgia in that election.  New Yorkers went for Carter by nearly a 2-to-1 margin offsetting the pro-Ford upstate vote.  Voters in Cincinatti, Cleveland, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh also swung their states into the Democratic camp.  Even the \"solid South\" would have split between Ford and Carter had not Southern city-dwellers faithfully come out for the farmer from Plains.</span></p> <p><span>With these facts in mind, a big city party leader remarked on election night 1976 that \"We won the election for him.  The question is whether he'll show us any gratitude.\"  Three and a half years later, the hopes that urban voters placed in Jimmy Carter remain unfulfilled.</span></p> <p><span>The plight of the American city has grown worse since Carter took office.  Devastating fiscal crises have recently pushed Chicago, New York, Cleveland, Detroit, Memphis and many other cities dangerously close to bankruptcy.  More tragically, poverty persists for millions of urban dwellers.  One out of three children born in New York City, for example, are born out of wedlock--many to adolescent mothers whose welfare checks form their only source of income.  But New York's financial woes have made it impossible for that city to increase its welfare payments since 1974 with the effect that inflation has eaten away half the income of these adolescent mothers.</span></p> <p><span>Unemployment in cities is significantly higher than the national average--for urban-based minorities it's often two to three times higher.  Many inner-city high schools no longer teach students even the most basic math and English skills.  Crime forces city dwellers to live in perpetual fear.  Increasingly, poor people cannot find non-dilapidated low income housing in which to live and raise families.</span></p> <p><span>President Carter knew that these problems faced America's cities when he took office over three years ago, Yet despite his promises to attack these urban problems, he has consistently ignored them.  Pointing to just one example, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan recently wrote that \"Mr. Carter has broken his welfare promise.  That is what hurts.  It is not that he has tried and failed:  he has not tried.\"</span></p> <p><span>Of course the President denies Moynihan's charges.  As \"proof\" he points to the \"Comprehensive National Urban Policy\" that he submitted to Congress two years ago in March of 1978.  But Carter's urban policy contained only token proposals that resulted in little relief to the most economically distressed areas of the U.S.  He called for a \"New Partnership\" among all levels of American government.  But the Fed quickly spurned its part of the agreement.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE PRESIDENT'S only \"Comprehensive Urban Policy\" is one of words and no action.  Carter promised a \"National Development Bank\" devoted almost entirely to rebuilding distressed urban areas.  But no bank has been established.  He promised \"employment ... to the long-term unemployed and the disadvantaged in cities.\"  Yet this past January unemployment in the United States reached an 18-month high of 6.2 per cent.  In New York City, 64,000 people lost their jobs last December alone, and nearly one out of ten workers waited on unemployment lines.</span></p> <p><span>Carter's 1981 \"recession\" budget will push the national unemployment rate up to about 8 per cent.  According to the Congressional Budget Office, nearly one out of four black Americans will be jobless.  These blacks constitute the \"disadvantaged\" and \"long-term unemployed\" of America's cities.  Yet somehow Carter has taken away their jobs, not put them to work.  The president has also promised to \"provide fiscal relief to the most hard pressed communities,\" to fund neighborhood organizations, to \"provide additional social and health services to the disadvantaged people in cities\" and to \"improve the urban physical environment\"--more and better housing.  But this self-declared populist president has sorely disappointed the urban poor.  They've seen no new national health plan.  Carter's welfare \"reform\" proposal may establish minimum family payments, but only in certain states of his native South and the Southwest.  While Texas--the land of wind-fall profits--would have most of its welfare bills picked up by the Fed, New York would get what Senator Moynihan called \"a token 5 per cent increase in Federal participation.\"</span></p> <p><span>In 1977 Carter walked through the South Bronx and promised fiscal relief.  Today this razed neighborhood continues to look like a bombed-out war zone--victimized by arsonists and ruled by street gangs with chains and sawed-off shotguns.  His funding of neighborhood groups has also taken a downward turn.  When measured in real dollars (adjusted for inflation), Carter's proposed 1981 budget will guarantee a cut in the two major sources of community development funding.  The Community Development Block Grants program will suffer a 5 per cent reduction in funding while the president will cut the Urban Development Action Grants by 10 per cent.  If Carter were seriously committed to revitalizing America's cities, he would never tolerate these cutbacks in Federal aid.</span></p> <p><span>Worst of all, President Carter has taken the lead in dismantling the Federal government's low-income housing programs.  In 1968, President Johnson predicted that to meet the housing needs of America's poor, the Federal government would have to build, subsidize or rehabilitate 600,000 units of low-income housing each year.  This goal has never been reached, but Carter's performance in this area makes his Republican predecessors look like radical social democrats.  In 1976, under the Ford Administration, 526,721 units of public housing were subsidized by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.  In his 1980 budget, Carter cut this number by more than half.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>T ITS CORE, Carter's neglect of the problems of America's cities translates into an unwillingness to fight poverty or to use the presidency as a force to better the position of poor people and minority groups in American society.  The current crisis of America's cities highlights a retreat from the Great Society.  Today inner-city poverty entraps millions of Americans--not just blacks.  It suffocates them with poor housing, poor schooling and few jobs.  And as cities across the United States gasp for new life, Jimmy Carter blows them only hot air.</span></p>"}

Squatting in the middle of a glass-strewn parking lot overlooking a smelter, the Colosseum is a little bit of Italy in West Springfield, Mass.  After all, there is the Toga Room.  And the Julius Room, and the Caeser Room.  And the place is curved, in stucco appreciation of the real thing.  And there's marble in the bathrooms, except it's peeling near the sinks, where the water has soaked off the backing.</span></p> <p><span>Close up, you can see the pencil lines on all the posters, drawn to make sure the tempera slogans come out nice and straight.  18 by 15 inch slices of white cardboard, they hang square-cornered around the room, like paintings for sale in the lobby of a tacky movie theater.  All red, white, blue, and black, all a little scary.  <i>The B-1:  A Necessary Vitamin to Ward Off the Red Disease.  Win One for the Gipper:  Reagan 1980.  Help Put the Laffer Curve to Work for Reagan.  Big Government is the Enemy Within.  Table <b>SALT.</b></i>  And stretched across the front, in big red letters, <i>Remember the Canalamo.</i></span></p> <p><span>Luncheon guests trickle in, the first an hour before Reagan is scheduled to arrive.  The master of ceremonies begins the proceedings by pointing out luminaries; the biggest hand for the chairman of the East Longmeadow Republican Town Committee.  Reporters, most of them from local radio stations, stand attentively in the roped-off press area, their secret service badges pinned on conspicuously, so all can know they are members of the \"Press Corps.\"  The Secret Service men don't have much to do--hostility looks beyond the emotional range of most of those occupied with the turkey roll.  So they talk about the coat check girl, or rather about her generous, black-sweatered bosom.</span></p> <p><span>There couldn't be a better setting for Ronald Reagan--like the Toga Room, an imperfect relic of a different age.  Reagan outlines for the crowd his solution to the Afghanistan crisis--a blockade of the island nation of Cuba, nothing in and nothing out until the Soviets withdraw from the Afghan nation.  \"All we've been doing is reacting.  Why don't we give them something to think about, like Cuba?\"  he suggests, to cheers.  \"I think it's time we quit telling the enemy what we won't do, and letting them go to bed at night wondering what we might do.\"  More cheers.  Reagan is building to a climax.  \"The president told us SALT II had to be ratified or no one would like us.  He told us we had to give away our canal or no one would like us.  It's time to tell the president we don't care if other countries like us, that instead we want to be respected.\"  Standing ovation.</span></p> <p><span><b>L</b>ATER, A HALF-HOUR alone with the man shows nothing further underneath.  Ask about nuclear--Reagan will lean forward, voice husky with sincerity and with the strain of endless campaigning.  \"I wish students would look into the entire problem, so they could see the refutation that is available,\" he says.  Now expansive, leaning back, reciting Guiness-Book evidence.  \"Even Three Mile Island, and that was worst, had less radiation than flying coast-to-coast on an airplane.  Less radiation than living at the altitude of Denver.\"  Reassuring, even compassionate now, Reagan switches topics; he counsels young people not to protest against the draft, for it will only make them look \"silly and unpatriotic,\" just like \"those ones in the sixties.\"</span></p> <p><span>The rhetoric, the posters, the silent wife who fits snugly into the curve under his shoulder, are convincing.  Ronald Reagan is not a subtle man; while it is likely that during his tenure the Communists (or, if you prefer, \"the enemy\") will go to bed at night less sure of their safety, it is also true that many Americans may sleep more fitfully.  \"You can bet Communists aren't going to move until it's a sure thing.  What we must do is send them some signals.\"</span></p> <p><span>Reagan is watching his campaign slowly slip away, the sand crumbling under his feet, like a kind trying to stand in the backwash of the surf.  There are still hopeful signs; Reagan speaks of a \"national constituency\" explaining that Iowa (and, perhaps, New Hampshire) aren't as important as America.  And downstairs, a middle-aged woman tries to get into the \"security area\" the Secret Service man have set up around the candidate.  She is armed with a Canon AE-1, 200 mm lens firmly attached.  \"I don't know how to use this; it's my son-in-law's.  But I must see Mr. Reagan.  He's so good-looking.\"</span></p> <p><span>However, this is 1980, and definitely Reagan's last shot at the presidency, not because he is old, although he is, but because he is Reagan, a conservative.  Not a neo-conservative or a subtle conservative, but a conservative who likes talking tough, who believes in the slogans, who looks at the world from the perspective of World War II and Korea instead of mouthing meaningless, magic phrases like \"geopolitical linkage.\"  His ideas are not slick, not sophisticated.  They are firm, not greasy like Baker's or Bush's or Jimmy Carter's.</span></p> <p><span>Cascades of balloons used to be a staple of political functions, back in the days when \"party regular\" was a title of respect and market research was just a glimmer in some Madison Avenue mind.  Convention after convention, speech after speech, they'd release the balloons, each weighted with a drop of water, at the climatic moment.  Today, the balloon drop is a dying art form.  But for Reagan it looks appropriate; the huge plastic bag, pregnant with balloons, hangs from the ceiling of the Toga Room, waiting to deliver on cue.  Nowadays, though, it's hard to find anyone who can engineer the spectacle.  Reagan brought the audience to its feet at his close, looked skyward--nothing.

{"title": "Money for Thought | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>he image of the inspired scientist retiring to an isolated laboratory and daily coming up with miraculous new breakthroughs is mesmerizing but false.  Jimmy Carter and his budget advisers understand that science takes time and money.  His 1981 budget proposal reverses the disturbing trend in science policy during the past 15 years that had severely limited the funds available to certain researchers.  Carter's new budget proposes investing more money than ever, $33.7 billion (up 12 per cent from last year) in America's scientific research and development.  Carter's allocation is especially unusual in an election year.  While the pressure for spending cutbacks increases daily, he encourages scientific progress.</span></p> <p><span>Carter's emphasis on work in basic research--research designed to expand knowledge without concern for the immediate usefulness of the new information, shows foresight.  Today's scientists work on projects that might last ten years.  They collaborate with other workers to share the use and cost of the sophisticated and expensive equipment essential for advanced studies.  To deter the obsolescence of such equipment, Carter innovately calls for \"centralized equipment\" available on a regional basis to several groups of workers, and offers special funds for this purpose.</span></p> <p><span>Scientific breakthroughs often require years of fundamental research.  The recombinant DNA technology that now allows scientists to produce insulin and interferon in the laboratory, had its roots in biological fields far removed from today's remarkable gene splicing experiments.  A 40-year store of information in virology, cell biology and genetics, gathered by workers who could not even imagine the techniques of today, was necessary for the recent breakthroughs.  University professors led this advance, and Carter has responded by raising the funds arriving at college campuses by 11 per cent.</span></p> <p><span>Carter also proposes new links between industry and Congress in his attempt to accelerate research in certain critical areas.  To make our limited gas supplies go further, Carter advocates a ten-year, $800 million fund (to be matched by money from industry) for work in automotive technology.  He would finance this work with revenue from the windfall profits tax stalled in Congress.  Additionally the National Science Foundation (NSF) will receive $700 million over ten years to join major oil companies in sponsoring ocean drilling programs.</span></p> <p><span>Carter wisely has not fallen prey to the pressures for development of technologies with immediate application.  Like physics research in the computer age, biomedical research has recently entered the commercial marketplace.  The success of recombinant DNA work has turned basic research into applied science.  Corporations have now entered the science game looking for quick profit.  Carter sees that cutting research would push many scientists into industry and damage longterm prospects for future achievements.  The imaginative ideas that offer practical benefits have often appeared at the end of a road dotted with less practicable but nonetheless critical ideas.  Promising money to those who offer quick and patentable ideas can only hurt science.</span></p> <p><span>Carter correctly predicts that the longterm pay-off from his support will be tremendous:  \"We benefit today, in new industries, in millions of jobs, in lives saved and in lives protected--from the investments in science made decades ago.\"  Jimmy Carter has planted a scientific tree that will bear fruit for many years.</span></p>"}

There are, however, two major parts to the answer:  one having to do with why they invaded now, and the second, with what they might be expected to gain and lose in such an invasion.  Answering the first part is easier.  The Soviets, we know, had pretty much given up on detente and, therefore, felt they had little to lose in terms of their relations with the United States.  In conversations I had with a high ranking official of the Soviet Embassy just before Christmas, and therefore before the Soviet invasion, he indicated that his government was dismayed by the Senate's dealings with the SALT II treaty and had written off its successful ratification.  He further indicated the real dismay that his government had at the U.S. insistence on placing a new generation of nuclear missiles in Europe in the face of what he claimed to be the generous offer of President Brezhnev in October to enter negotiations on the European missile issue.  He also noted the decision already made on the part of the U.S. administration to increase the arms budget 5 per cent above inflation and the agreement to go ahead with further plans for the building and deployment of the new MX missile system.  But, if this explains the Soviet willingness to give up on detente, their move into Afghanistan still seems more complex.  In one sense, it follows directly from their long-term geopolitical policies in the region.  As any Soviet spokesperson will rapidly make clear to an inquirer, they look with anxiety to their southern borders, stretching from Turkey to a now unstable Iran to a potentially unstable Afghanistan (though, prior to the invasion, it already had a Marxist government which came to power through a coup d'etat in 1978) and to an openly hostile China.  Some experts, therefore, clearly trace this invasion to Soviet concerns for their southeastern borders and the increasing belligerence with their Chinese neighbors.  While Soviet officials proclaim their belief that in the long run Afghanistan must be non-aligned and neutral, they do not give a convincing timetable on their intended withdrawal of troops, and, indeed, they repeatedly indicate that it will be slowed down by any U.S. escalation of military activity in the region.  The same high ranking Soviet Embassy official, in a more recent discussion, expressed strong fears that the U.S. was becoming involved with China to the detriment of the Soviet Union.  He pointed back to Vice President Mondale's visit to Peking in September and the recent visit of the U.S. Defense Secretary.  From the Soviet perspective, there is an enormously strong fear of a U.S.-Chinese alliance which has become a fundamental element of Soviet policy.</span></p> <p><span><b>What does the Soviet invasion mean for Middle-Eastern peace and U.S. access to oil?</b></span></p> <p><span>There is little doubt that the Soviets are fearful of instabilities on their southern boundaries, and in the case of Afghanistan, they showed their willingness to act with direct military intervention.  One surmises that they are also concerned about the instabilities created by the Islamic revolution in Iran.  But is is also clear that, certainly in recent years, they have not considered Iran part of the Soviet orbit and were willing to live in peaceful relations (including fairly extensive trade) with the repressive government of the Shah.  This was much to the dismay of the Iranian Communist Party--the Tudeh--which often complained bitterly.  The strong claims made so far by U.S. leaders that the Soviets were heading for the Persian Gulf and control of the oil fields, or at least the oil shipping routes, are broad speculation.  To date, the Soviets are net oil exporters rather than importers, and while it is quite clear that they have a direct interest in the conduct of affairs in the Middle East, they do not have a record of direct military intervention there.  At the moment, their penetration of the region is quite weak, with friendly governments only in South Yemen and Ethiopia.  They have been invited out of Somalia and Egypt, from which they withdrew their military advisers, and they have lost significant influence in both Syria and Iraq which previously had been seen as friends, if not actual allies.  The United States, by contrast, is now making strong claims to creating something like a protectorate in the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea for the oil producing countries.  I have been struck, however, by the lack of enthusiasm shown by the Saudis and other oil producing states for coming under American protection.  It would seem that at this point it is in the best interests of both the United States and the Soviet Union to enter mutual agreements for fair and just access for all parties to the oil supplies of the Middle East rather than setting up the type of confrontation we are now witnessing.</span></p> <p><span><b>Is the United States' response to Soviet actions bringing us closer to or helping to prevent the out-break of war--nuclear war?</b></span></p> <p><span>As reprehensible as the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan clearly is, it seems to me that the U.S. response has so rapidly escalated the sitation as to provide significant threat in itself.  The rush to draw lines, to enter alliances, to seek bases and the start the shipment of significant new armaments to countries in the region, all add up to a dangerous and rapid drift to war.  To easily seek military alliances with repressive regimes like that of Marshal Zia ul Haq in Pakistan, or the royal family in Saudi Arabia, seems to be creating just the same kinds of situations that brought crisis and resentment after the fall of the Shah of Iran.  Indeed, as we look at the confrontation building up in the Middle East, with the rapid deployment of U.S. naval forces in the Indian Ocean, the Arabian Sea and the Persian Gulf, we are witnessing just the kind of scenario that experts have long predicted would be the most probable path for beginning a nuclear war.  This was recently reinforced by reports of a Defense Department study claiming that adequate defense in the region would require the use of tactical nuclear weapons.  We know that U.S. naval forces are armed with short range nuclear weapons, and it is probable that ground forces deployed in the region would also have tactical nuclear weapons their disposal.  If nuclear exchanges begin, it is difficult to see how the line can be drawn against moving to larger scale exchanges, ultimately ending with strategic weapons.  In a region which has been so unstable in recent years, it seems the height of foolishness to race to new arms and to promises to provide sophisticated newweapons to countries with long standing enmities such as those which exist between Pakistan and India.  In addition, the U.S. decision to play the \"China card\" by supplying militarily useable technologies to that country seems to bear out the Soviet estimate of U.S. intentions.  I can only look with dismay at what seems to a U.S. Middle East policy based more on election year needs than on prudent judgment about how to avoid war and secure a stable and peaceful Middle East.</span></p> <p><span><b>What should be the U.S. response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the potential threat to the Middle East?</b></span></p> <p><span>The alternative policy to the one adopted by the current administration with its cold war visions and its hard line rhetoric would be to attempt to find means for negotiated settlements.  Such an agreement would take advantage of the clear interest of the non-aligned countries to keep both super powers out of the region and would encourage efforts among the non-aligned nations in the U.N. to find the means to allow the super powers to draw back from confrontation.  A U.S. policy aimed at peaceful settlement would attempt to find agreements reflecting the interests of both parties on access to Middle East oil and to shipping through the region.  It would be a policy aimed at including the Soviets in the Middle East peace process rather than following our current course of freezing them out.  The Middle East, after all, lies on the southern borders of the Soviet Union and it is surely a mistake to think that real peace can be made in the region without their direct involvement.</span></p> <p><span><b>What really happened with SALT II, and why was it having such trouble getting ratified by the U.S. Senate?</b></span></p> <p><span>SALT II was in deep trouble because the hawks in the Senate and the Administration had refused to accept the basic tenet of the treaty--equality in nuclear arms and security--and instead insisted on the maintenance of U.S. superiority.  They, once again, claimed a new \"missile gap,\" forcing the President, even during the SALT ratification procedures, to agree to a substantial budgetary increase for new weapons and to commit the government to the production and deployment of the MX missile system.  The really frightening thing about the new stage in the nuclear arms race, and it is just this new stage that we are moving to with SALT seemingly dead, is that it will bring us fully into the era of counterforce weapons and first-strike strategies.  The relative stability of reliance on deterrent weapons--those used only in the event that an enemy launched weapons first--will be lost, and a much less stable situation where one must attempt to \"out-guess\" a potential enemy, firing first in order to knock out enemy weapons before they can be used, will take its place.  Not only will the cost of the new weapons systems be staggering, but no new security will be gained.  Indeed, at this point, with 30,000 nuclear warheads held by the United States and 20,000 by the Soviet Union, each side has the ability to kill the other many times over.  It would seem that the only parties who have anything to gain in the newly invigorated nuclear arms race are the arms manufacturers who have been, incidentally, significant lobbyists against the SALT treaty.</span></p> <p><span><b>Is nuclear arms control and disarmament still possible?</b></span></p> <p><span>Yes, but only if there is vigorous public action to take control of the arms race out of the hands of the hawks and return it to those who would conduct careful negotiations and ratify meaningful treaties.  SALT was, actually, not a great treaty in that it allowed each side to increase the number of warheads in some categories and to build major new missile systems.  But even now, I think it is possible to control the arms race and put a cap on it if a will to disarmament is created.  An immediate moratorium by both the United Sates and the Soviet Union on the deployment and production of all new strategic weapons would provide just such a possibility.  Such a moratorium is not farfetched, but represents a very realistic approach.  It could rely on the means of detection and verification that each side already has and had already acknowledged as adequate for monitoring the SALT agreements.  It would restrict the Soviets from adding new multiple warheads to their large SS-18 missile and the United States from embarking on the production and deployment of the MX missile system.  An important irony of the nuclear arms race is that more weapons do not give greater security, but instead add to instability.  Each side has moved beyond the number of missiles that a rational system of defense would require, and instead has built--one goaded on by the other--nuclear arsenals which, if ever used, would be incredibly destructive.  The frightening thing about the present crises is the resultant tendency to escalate to nuclear warfare.  Indeed, President Carter was absolutely wrong in drawing back from ratification of SALT II, for as political and military instabilities increase, agreements on nuclear weapons are ever more necessary.  No longer is there a question of whether nuclear disarmament is possible; rather, I am certain that it is necessary.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Asterisks, Stragglers and the Overlooked | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>For the record, Rep. Phillip Crane (R-Ill.) stands slightly to the right of fellow Republican presidential candidate Ronald Reagan.  The only difference between the two--on the issues, at least--is Crane's opposition to federal aid for the poor and elderly to offset rising energy costs.</span></p> <p><span>Like Reagan, Crane favors the Kemp-Roth tax bill, development of the MX missile, the B-1 bomber, the neutron bomb, nuclear energy, the decontrol of oil, the prohibition of abortion and the easing of environmental regulations to allow the burning of coal.</span></p> <p><span>Crane, again like Reagan, opposes the windfall profits tax, wage and price controls, aid to the Chrysler corporation, SALT II, gun control, busing, the Department of Education, the Equal Rights Amendment, and comprehensive national health insurance.</span></p> <p><span>Unlike Reagan, Crane bills himself as the next presidential history teacher.  And unlike Reagan, Crane doesn't stand a chance.  The hard-rock Republican from Illinois is the paragon of the sleek modern conservative--more crudely, of the classical liberal.  And some people know he's running for president.</span></p> <p><span>Crane initiated an \"early bird\" campaign--declaring his candidacy way back in the summer of 1978-- in the hopes of achieving the recognition necessary to make a significant run.  In Iowa, his version of militarism and frugality siphoned off about 7 percent of the caucus vote.  He will have to show far better in the New Hampshire primary to gain that revered political intangible--momentum.  His workers admit that the biggest surprise in the Crane camp has been the ascendance of George Bush, former director of the CIA.  \"Bush is the new superstar on the block,\" says Gregory F. Cronin, Crane's Massachusetts campaign coordinator.  \"He has taken a bit out of the shine of our recent impact.\"</span></p> <p><span>But in a campaign that promises to exhaust and saturate, Crane has already been slogging campaign that has, thus far, stressed style over content, Phil Crane owns a handsome visage, an endless store of historical quotes and a natty wardrobe.  Phil Crane is a political operator who harkens back to other days.  Quoting Lincoln and Jefferson ad infinitum, he always has the right smile or the right historical quotation; after months of practice, Phil Crane is smooth.</span></p> <p><span>Like the rest of the crammed Republican field, Crane's prospects depend largely on New Hampshire, where he hopes to break the 10 percent barrier.  \"We feel Crane is on the way up.  He has considerable strength in Florida, potential in Alabama and is looking forward to his home state's primary on March 18,\" Cronin says.  Given his ideological affinity to Reagan--Crane labels himself the \"inheritor of the conservative vote\"--some observes have speculated Crane might throw his support behind Reagan.</span></p> <p><span>Crane's supporters rest their hopes on the small possibility that the pace of the campaign will eventually coax Reagan into withdrawing.  Eugene Shannon, Crane's New Hampshire coordinator, said recently that the ex-California Governor \"would be doing the conservative movement in this country\" a favor by withdrawing from the race.  Cronin is adamant about distinguishing his man from Reagan.  \"Frankly, I don't think he (Reagan) can keep up the campaign pace.  The more conservatives out there the merrier--but Reagan is disastrous extemporaneously,\" he adds.</span></p> <p><span>Crane's background as an American history professor has lent a modicum of intellectual legitimacy to his quest for the presidency.  His stance on specific issues, however, has caused some of his congressional constituents to wonder if Crane has even the slightest understanding of social concerns.  In Phil Crane's world, health and social programs fall by the wayside and missiles and strike-forces take their place.</span></p> <p><span>If Crane fancies himself a teacher, however, his concern for the student vote is on shaky ground.  When a student requested an interview this week, an aide at Crane's Boston campaign headquarters snapped back.  \"You can understand, can't you, why Mr. Crane does not want to spend too much of his time talking to college students?  College students are not reliable voters, and most of those who are voting are not really receptive to his ideas.\"</span></p> <p><span>Barring a major drift in the political tides, Crane's reception in New Hampshire tomorrow should be equally encouraging.</span></p>"}
{"title": "March 4:  Playing Second Fiddle | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The press can tell you there are three ways to get into the public eye:  be lucky, be important, or be a relative.  Massachusetts has always struggled to gain peripheral attention for its primaries, while sister New Hampshire's contest stole the show.  The Bay State is playing second fiddle again this year, benefitting only through association--the primary here is March 4, one week after the Granite State's.  If you go by delegate counts, Massachusetts is more than five times more influential in awarding the presidential nomination than its northern neighbor.  But who really cares about New Hampshire's 19 delegates anyway?</span></p> <p><span>Massachusetts managed to appropriate its own share of the spotlight briefly in 1972 after years with a dogged Democratic reputation and not much visibility.  The '72 primary gave Massachusetts a hefty ego boost--its majority vote for Sen. George McGovern, coming on the same day as his victory in Pennsylvania, clinched his nomination and extinguished Edmund Muskie's waning hopes.  Of course, the Bay State went on to greater glory and better bumper-sticker copy (\"Don't Blame Me, I'm From Massachusetts\") as the only state to vote for McGovern over former President Richard M. Nixon in the general election that year.</span></p> <p><span>But succeeding years have stripped away the silver-plated armor of Massachusetts voters, leaving only their tough Democratic nature exposed--and even that may be losing some of its sheen.  In 1976, a cocky Jimmy Carter gathered a meager 14 per cent in a heavy snowstorm to finish behind Henry Jackson, George Wallace, <i>and</i> Mo Udall.  Two years later, liberal Governor Michael S. Dukakis, who now teaches public policy at the Kennedy School of Government, lost in the gubernatorial primary to old-style Democrat Edward J. King.  A Kennedy drubbing would deligh King, who beat liberal Republican Frank Hatch and took office last January.  He has since become anathema to government officials who have a reputation to lose.  King is actively campaigning for Carter, undoubtedly hoping for a mandate against Kennedy's policies to make things less pleasant for liberals in the state--especially Kennedy himself and freshman Sen. Paul Tsongas.</span></p> <p><span>With a mere 20 per cent of the voters marking Republican ballots in '76, GOP candidates aren't likely to sink many hard-won dollars into a media blitz this year.  If Bush wins (and with his well-oiled Massachusetts campaign machinery, he could capture 35 per cent of the vote), the victory will simply help him shift into higher gear and take in more contributions from his increasing number of college-educated, upper-income supporters.  Others can write off the state beforehand and blame Bush's Andover and Yale backgroung for a strong New England showing.</span></p> <p><span>Still, the bids for second and third place are potentially colorful, if the state's Independents, who form more than 40 per cent of its registered voters, paint the background.  Under Massachusetts's unusual system, an Independents may pick either party's ballot when he casts his primary vote, and Independents may find the Republican race more exciting, especially if Kennedy does well in New Hampshire and looks like a shoo-in in his home state.</span></p> <p><span>Although many Independents chose the conservative Wallace and Jackson in '76, especially in the Boston area, a growing contingent of college students and young adults registered as Independents may look toward John Anderson, the man-without-a-party liberal Republican.  A third-place finish by Anderson is not necessarily just a gleam in his campaign manager's eye.  After all, Ronald Reagan just doesn't care about the Massachusetts race, which is probably a good thing because Republicans who supported former President Ford in '76 wouldn't vote for the Californian anyway.  And Sen. Howard Baker may all too easily yield third place--he has hired only four campaign staffers to work the entire state.</span></p> <p><span>By and large, though, Independents are likely to weigh in on the Democratic ticket as they have in the past, and, as they have in the last 17 years of senate races, they are likely to vote for Kennedy--out of habit, if nothing else.  Although Massachusetts voters probably won't be looking over their shoulders to New Hampshire (heavily blue collar and Catholic, despite liberals seeping across the line seeking lower taxes) to tell them how to vote, an especially poor showing by Kennedy there could prompt more active support in Massachusetts.  But the Kennedy camp is wise to be wary of too much optimism--only two years ago Dukakis discovered the hard way that liberal supporters stay at home if they don't feel needed.</span></p> <p><span>Kennedy not only has to win, he has to beat the percentages to leave New England with any self-respect, especially if Carter beats him by more than a 10-per-cent spread in New Hampshire.  With Georgia and Florida only a week later, it will be almost impossible to soften the direct comparisons of Carter's and Kennedy's support on their own playing fields.  But chief Kennedy pollster Gary R. Orren, former associate professor but the result of steady organizational work.\"  Kennedy and Brown campus organizations began earlier than Carter's and have picked up support from previously uncommited anti-registration activists, he adds.  \"The Carter people have not stressed college students, this time or in 1976,\" Olivas concludes, \"maybe after this they will change their tactics.\"</span></p> <p><span>Olivas' professional counterparts are far less worried about reports of snowballing Kennedy momentum, and they minimize the effect of the senator's anti-Rose Garden barbs.  \"We have not witnessed any Kennedy charge since his speeches at Georgetown or Harvard.  In fact, after the Georgetown speech, we got more volunteers just like Kennedy did, although he did get more,\" Flynn says.</span></p> <p><span>Woodward believes the president's February 13 press conference, his only public response to the Kennedy charges, \"had a positive effect on the voters.  He (Carter) looked presidential in contrast to Senator Kennedy of late.  Remember, Carter only said 'uh' once.\"</span></p> <p><span>Carter's \"presidential\" performance included several exaggerated lunges at Kennedy.  Questioned repeatedly about Kennedy's charges, Carter said his opponent had made statements \"damaging to our country\" and to the negotiations for the hostages in Tehran.</span></p> <p><span>The media's interpretation of the Maine caucus results remains a touchy topic among the Carter troops.  \"We're sitting back and wondering how that could be a gain for Kennedy.  How does that loss give him momentum?\"  asked Gallagher.  Flynn jokes, \"If we could take a string of 'losses' like that to the convention we would be in fine shape.\"  These oversimplified responses ignore reality:  Kennedy's dramatic personal appearances have revived his campaign after the Iowa disaster, while Carter has kept a grim vigil in the Oval Office.</span></p> <p><span>Kennedy has also made gains by attacking the administration's performance on domestic issues.  Without Carter on the stump--justifying and explaining why the inflation he has promised to bring down since 1976 continues to rise--staffers have had to rely on White House representatives and a deft combination of sidestepping and counter-punching.  \"We can only point out what they (the administration) are doing about inflation and energy and that they are long term problems.  We also point out that the programs Senator Kennedy has proposed are unrealistic and actually fuel inflation,\" says Woodward.  More specifically, the Carter people try to emphasize recent executive accomplishments, such as civil service reform and the creation of the Department of Education, while reminding voters that Carter has so far fulfilled his vow to supply the Northeast with home heating oil for the winter.</span></p> <p><span>Despite their gallant stabs at cheerfulness, Carter's campaign directors in Massachusetts and New Hampshire realize that President Carter's absence has only added to the problems of preparing for the upcoming primaries.  The incumbent president dropping by attracts large crowds and television cameras.  Chip and Jack Carter do not.  The excitement generated by a president not only makes headlines, but it also inspires staffers and volunteers to ring that final doorbell before the polls open.  Recalling long hours of work over the past month, Olivas says, \"The enthusiasm of having the president here certainly would have helped us.  It gets pretty cold walking the streets of New Hampshire all alone.</span></p>"}
{"title": "New Hampshire is Only the Beginning | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>For all the attention it gets from the candidates and the media, the New Hampshire primary, numerically speaking, is a drop in the bucket.  Granted that a strong showing in the Granite State reaps huge rewards for a campaign:  publicity, money, volunteers, and the aura of success.  But in terms of delegates to the national conventions, New Hampshire is not worth much.  At stake are 19 Democratic delegates--one-half of 1 per cent of the total--and 22 Republican delegates--slightly more than 1 per cent of the total.  By comparison, Minnesota, which holds caucuses on the same day as the New Hampshire primary, contributes 75 Democratic and 34 Republican delegates.</span></p> <p><span>The U.S. system of dozens of primaries and caucuses may be cumbersome, complicated, convoluted and confusing, but all the voters have to do is vote.  The candidates and their strategists must devise ways to negotiate the upcoming months of democracy-in-action so as to garner the delegate totals necessary to win nomination.  There are 3331 delegates to the Democratic convention and 1993 to the Republican.  It isn't easy.</span></p> <p><span>Campaign officials last week mapped out strategies laden with contingency plans, \"what ifs\" and \"in the event thats.\"  In a process in which the next move depends so much on what happened before, it is difficult, they say, to plan too far ahead.  Therefore, some don't.</span></p> <p><span>Rep. John B. Anderson (R-Ill.), who expects a strong third-place finish in New Hampshire and an even stronger--perhaps second-place--finish in Massachusetts, has entered only two primaries after he leaves the Commonwealth:  Illinois on March 18 and Wisconsin on April 1.</span></p> <p><span>\"I don't think we'd be ready to fold up our little tents and go home\" if Anderson does not do so well as he expects in New Hampshire and Massachustts, Bonnie Corman, Anderson's press secretary, says, adding that the Republican liberal is definitely in the race until Wisconsin.  After that, \"we'll have to reassess the campaign,\" she says.</span></p> <p><span>The other Illinois congressman in the race, Rep. Phillip M. Crane, is not looking much past his home state either.  The conservative will be happy if he can break into the double figures in New Hampshire--10 or 11 per cent--and remain with the pack in Massachusetts with 15 to 18 per cent, Gregory F. Cronin, Crane's Massachusetts state coordinator, says.  Such expectations are not \"overly optimistic,\" Cronin says, but admits that anything less than double figures will make it \"tough to continue.\"</span></p> <p><span>While the congressmen from Illinois may be calling it quits soon after their home state primary, most of the other candidates, at least for now, plan to be in for the duration.  That does not mean, however, that they all expect to win everywhere.</span></p> <p><span>Only George Bush's camp on the Republican side expresses optimism about the early northeastern contest--and guarded optimism at that.  \"It will be very close in New Hampshire--neck-and-neck with Reagan.  That's good for us, considering where we came from,\" Judy Butler, assistant field director for the Bush campaign, says.  \"It's true we're going to have a really good showing (in New Hampshire and Massachusetts), but we don't consider ourselves the front-runner yet,\" she adds.</span></p> <p><span>The man to beat is still Ronald Reagan, who expects a slender first-place margin in New Hampshire.  \"A strong second-place showing is not what we want,\" Jack Thompson, Reagan's campaign press secretary, says.  Although he projects a Reagan win in New Hampshire, Thompson says he thinks Bush has the Massachusetts race wrapped up.  \"Everyone knew Bush would be strong,\" he says.  New England is not Reagan's \"strong suit,\" Thompson says, adding that the former California governor has \"no great expectations\" for the region because of his poor showing here against Gerald R. Ford in 1976.</span></p> <p><span>With Reagan and Bush vying for top spot in the New Hampshire and Massachusetts races, the other Republicans can hope for little more that strong third or even fourth place finishes.  But even such poor showings would not go unnoticed by the front-runners.  If Crane's hopes for a double-figure finish in New Hampshire come true, Reagan could be hurt, Thompson says.</span></p> <p><span>Bush's people are closely watching the floundering campaign of Sen. Howard H. Baker (R-Tenn.), who got off to a late start and for whom anything less than third place in either state could spell disaster.  A poor showing by Baker would excite Bush; the former ambassador hopes to knock his main moderate challenger out of the race early, Butler says.</span></p> <p><span>Although he participated in last week's debate in New Hampshire, Sen. Robert J. Dole (R-Kan.) has as much chance of winning as a VW Rabbit in the Indianapolis 500.  Already Dole has all but officially removed himself from the race.  John B. Connally, meanwhile, is ignoring the Northeastern primaries in favor of a \"Southern strategy.\"  \"I would be surprised if he did better than fourth in New Hampshire,\" Joseph Malone, his Massachusetts state coordinator says.</span></p> <p><span>On the Democratic side in the Northeast, strategists for Sen. Edward M. Kennedy '54 (D-Mass.) expect their man to lose New Hampshire and win his home state.  Kennedy has to win Massachusetts, Rick Stearns, Kennedy's director of delegate selection, says, declining to specify by how much.  Kennedy will do well in New Hampshire \"only if a miracle happens,\" Stearns says.</span></p> <p><span>But President Carter's strategists also say they are not overly optimistic about the first primary.  Though Carter will probably win, he \"won't do quite as well as the polls show,\" Martin Franks, Carter's research director, says.</span></p> <p><span>The role of California Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. in the Democratic primaries is not all that significant, Carter's and Kennedy's workers say.  Franks says Brown has drawn some liberal support away from Kennedy as a result of his strong anti-nuclear stand.  Although that support may help Brown in New Hampshire, Stearns is not particularly alarmed.  He notes Brown's organizational and financial problems:  \"Their problem is ours magnified by 20 or 30.\"</span></p> <p><span>Larry Powers, press secretary for the Brown campaign, says his candidate must garner more than the 13 per cent he picked up in the Maine caucuses February 10.  Otherwise \"we will have to immediately reassess the whole campaign.\"  But he does not think a reassessment of the Brown campaign would necessarily portend its demise.  Says Powers:  \"Brown has said that whatever the New Hampshire results are, he still wants to campaign.\"</span></p> <p><span>After New Hampshire and Massachusetts, the campaigns move south, where most Republicans are emphasizing Florida.  Most, that is, except Connally.  The key to the former Texas governor's \"Southern strategy\" is the South Carolina primary on March 8.  Malone calls South Carolina \"the important one\" and predicts it will be a race among Reagan, Bush and Connally, with all three finishing tightly at the top.</span></p> <p><span>A photo finish with the front-runners would put Connally \"right in the thick of the battle\" and have a \"big influence\" in the Florida primary three days later, in which Connally does not expect to do as well, Malone says.  \"if the election were held today in Florida, Connally would be third or fourth,\" Malone admits.</span></p> <p><span>While acknowledging Connally's strength in the South, Thompson notes that most of Reagan's support in 1976 came from the South and West.  \"Southern voters tend not to change their minds over four years,\" he says.  But he will not predict victory in Florida.</span></p> <p><span>Cronin does not predict victory for Crane, either.  Crane is stressing Florida, where he believes his name recognition is higher and where he will stage a more extensive media campaign than he has in New England.  Cronin expects Crane to \"run with the front-runners,\" meaning that if Bush receives 35 per cent of the Florida vote, Crane will garner 25 per cent.</span></p> <p><span>From Bush's viewpoint, Florida is too close to call because Reagan has \"a lot of support from die-hard conservatives who live there,\" Butler says.  Connally's Malone thinks that Bush will wilt in the South:  unlike Carter four years ago (the campaign to which Bush's is most often compared), the transplanted Easterner is not moving into his area of strength after New England.</span></p> <p><span>Kennedy, meanwhile, is deemphasing the South in his campaign, perhaps in acknowledgment of Carter's strength in his home region.  In 1976 Carter swept almost all the southern primaries, repeatedly defeating expected winner George Wallace.  This time around, \"I'm sure Carter will be on top\" in the March 11 Florida, Alabama and Georgia primaries, Franks says.</span></p> <p><span>One week after the triplet of southern primaries is the Illinois contest, a vital test for both Republicans and Democrats.  On the surface, things look good for Kennedy:  large Northern industrial states are traditionally good for liberal Democrats, and he received the normally election-clinching endorsement of Chicago mayor Jane M. Byrne and the Cook County machine.</span></p> <p><span>But Stearns admits that the Kennedy campaign is in bad shape in Illinois because of rural downstate support for Carter and because of political turmoil in Chicago.  Since she announced her support for Kennedy, Byrne has been preoccupied with strikes by transit workers, firemen, and school teachers.  Moreover, the machine itself is plagued by vicious infighting.  \"It is certainly not the best campaign in the country,\" Stearns says, adding that most of the problems are local.</span></p> <p><span>He also says that the Illinois campaign suffered the greatest financial setback when funds began to dry up after Kennedy's 2-1 defeat in Iowa last month.  But despite Kennedy's woes in the Land of Lincoln, Carter's strategist does not predict overwhelming victory.  \"We're ahead at this point,\" Franks acknowledges, \"but the election is almost a month away.\"</span></p> <p><span>Because of the trouble in Illinois, Kennedy is playing up the March 25 primaries in New York and Connecticut as the ones to watch.  Franks says Kennedy's emphasis on New York as the first major test in a large Northern industrial state is a slight to the people of Illinois.  But it may be smart politics.  Carter lost New York the last time around, placing an embarrassing fourth behind Sen. Henry M. Jackson (D-Wash.), Rep. Morris K. Udall (D-Ariz.), and sundry uncommitteds.  Once through Illinois and New York, campaign officials are sketchy on strategy.</span></p> <p><span>The Republicans, too, are vague about their plans after Illinois.  Crane \"has not developed a strategy past\" his home state, Cronin says, \"but he has some of his best fund-raising capacity in Texas.\"  Cronin says he expects Connally to drop out of the race before the May 3 Lone Star primary.</span></p> <p><span>But Malone insists that Connally can do well in his home state.  If he does, \"it will be a shot to Bush.\"  Malone fully expects Connally to be in the race \"for the duration,\" on the belief that \"when they go into the convention, nobody is going to have the delegates wrapped up for the first ballot.\"  He adds:  \"Connally is a big second choice.\"</span></p> <p><span>Reagan, too, will continue to run, even if everything falls apart in the early New England and Southern contest.  Thompson says Reagan wants to take advantage of strong support in the West, especially in California.</span></p> <p><span>The ex-governor is looking to sweep the 168 delegates up for grabs in his home state.  But the other Republican candidates are already on the lookout; they have challenged the legality of the state's winner-take-all system, whereby the candidate who gets all the most votes gets all the convention votes.  If the challenges succeed and delegates are distributed proportionally, Reagan will be standing on very thin ice.</span></p> <p><span>A good showing on June 3 would be a big step--perhaps the final step--toward garnering the 997 delegate votes neccessary to clinch the Republican nomination or the 1666 delegates needed to become the Democratic nominee.  But June 3 is a long way off, especially in the world of presidential politics.  Even more remote are the speeches, slogans, revelling and backroom politicking of the July Republican national convention in Detroit and the August Democratic encore in Madison Square Garden.  With dozens of primaries and caucuses between now and then, November seems awfully far away.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Whatever Happened to Big John? | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The scenario was simple:  John Connally, after a successful lope through the primaries, would come to Detroit packing a wealthy and unstoppable political force.  He would later ride out of the Motor City with the momentum to carry him past a slumping Democratic challenger.  The people of the United States would wake up and recognize their need for strong leadership and would call Big John back from his Texas ranch to lead the country.</span></p> <p><span>For a while, it seemed to be working.  Backed by Big Business, Connally's campaign, the richest ($4.3 million) of an candidate's, seemed to be gaining strength everyday.  It appeared only a matter of time before the tough-talking Texan would be unstoppable.  There would be no grass roots for this man:  he would overwhelm an entire nation.</span></p> <p><span>But with the New Hampshire primary just one day away, John Connally is losing ground and running out of money.  Last week, Connally declared he will close his headquarters in states with primaries later than March 18.  His once-rising star in the polls is falling.  America may recognize the need for a strong leader, but if early indications are born out, that leader will not be Connally.</span></p> <p><span>Connally supporters naturally deny the claim that their candidate is faltering.  \"We are lying in wait,\" August G. Fromuth, his New Hampshire campaign manager, says.  \"Polls have fluctuated with great gradience,\" Fromuth says about Connally's deteriorating showing in a recent <i>New York Times</i> survey.  \"The thing to watch is how we do in the primaries.\"  Connally confidently foresees the downfall of former Governor Ronald Reagan, hoping to lasso many of his supporters.  He asserts that Republicans are looking for a \"real\" conservative to challenge former CIA director George Bush.  \"The conservatives,\" Fromuth says, \"want a winner.\"</span></p> <p><span>The big man's campaign strategy has never been to take an early lead, but to \"be in a position to take over the front runner's position in the middle of the race,\" Fromuth says.  Connally is concentrating his efforts on the March 8 primary in South Carolina, the first Southern primary, where he expects to finish second behind Reagan.  He then hopes for a first or second place finish in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Illinois.  Connally's greatest strength will be in these primaries, but even a strong showing here will probably not yield him the support he needs to ride home to the nomination.</span></p> <p><span>He runs on the platform that he will put \"a class act back into the White House,\" and in public settings the ex-Governor looks like he believes he will do just that.  He speaks loudly and radiates force, but there is still a certain charm.  The often scowling, sometimes fearsome product of the Texas oilman tradition declares that he always says what he thinks.  \"Anybody who thinks oil refineries are a greater threat than Communism must have something wrong with him,\" says Connally, and his conservative businessmen-backers smile.</span></p> <p><span>On economics, Connally offers simplistic solutions to not-so-simple problems.  In 1962, campaigning for Governor of Texas, Connally promised to cut the state budget by 10 percent.  Six years later, it was up 63 percent.  This time, tackling the federal scene, Connally has reduced his expectations, supporting a Constitutional amendment to balance the budget.  Connally, of course, provides no details, saying simply he would tell Congress to \"balance it\" and they would.  He has also promised the Japanese that unless they open their markets to more American products, \"they'd better be prepared to sit on the docks of Yokohama in their Toyotas watching their Sony televisions, because they aren't going to ship them here.\"</span></p> <p><span>In a year of Republican hawks, Connally hasn't missed a beat.  He stresses the need for an extensive build-up of United States armed forces.  His stance on the military is clear:  he is in favor of the MX missile, the B-1 bomber, the neutron bomb and a permanent U.S. presence in the Persian Gulf.  Marching alongside his competitors for the nomination, Connally is the answer to Pentagon dreams.  To counter the Soviet Union's aggressive moves in Afghanistan, Connally told New Hampshire voters at the Republican debate, \"I think we should use whatever influence we have to turn the world against the Russians.  We have no choice but to make a very, very substantial increase in military appropriations for this nation.\"  Connally, who was JFK's Secretary of the Navy, adds.  But Connally's militarism scares as many people as it pleases.</span></p> <p><span>Connally is invariably most direct when he deals with the most sensitive issues.  His call for an Israeli withdrawal from all occupied territories in exchange for an Arab guarantee of uninterrupted oil supplies has drawn heated criticism from Jews and non-Jews alike.  The former Governor has a penchant for tactless statements.  His comment that more people were killed at Chappaquiddick than at Three Mile Island insulted many.  Forceful and direct statements, however, have earned him the reputation of one who does not pull any punches.  To many supporters, the 52-year-old law-firm boss is a doer, a man of action, and by merely listening to his political speeches, one might believe it.</span></p> <p><span>If Connally is tactless, he is also tainted.  Big John's close ties with former President Nixon and the shadows of the milk-fund scandal certainly have not helped his cause.  In an uncharacteristically hesitant tone, Connally recently sideswiped a reporter's question about how, as President, he would deal with the report that Treasury Secretary G. William Miller's onetime charge, Textron Inc., bribed foreign officials.  \"I wouldn't pass judgment on whether or not he knew or whether he should have known,\" Connally said.  \"That's something that I don't have the information on which to base an informed judgement.\"</span></p> <p><span>Critics argue that, of all the Republican candidates, Connally has the least right to stand in judgement of another man's past.  The question of Connally's guilt in soliciting \"illegal gratuities\" from the Associate Milk Producers Inc. during his tenure as Treasury Secretary has not yet been laid to rest.  A jury found Big John innocent on two counts of accepting $10,000 gifts;, but the other five counts of perjury, for which the Justice Department had documented evidence showing he had lied to a federal grand jury, were dropped as a matter of course.  Connally proudly declares he is the only candidate \"certified honest by a jury,\" but many do not agree.</span></p> <p><span>Connally is tough, confident and flamboyant but in this year of conservative Republicans, a unique personality may not be enough.  If voters are looking for war-mongering conservatism, they can always turn to the aging Reagan.  If voters want something more optimistic and younger--but by all means conservative--there is Bush.  With Connally, there are strings of doubt attached.  The man who refused federal matching funds to demonstrate his fiscal conservatism, and secret service protection to show his closeness to the people, is running hard.  But as John Connally tries to move faster and faster, he is also running out of gas.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Reagan:  Reckless Over-confidence | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The New Hampshire cops pulled over Ronald Reagan's motorcade last week for speeding.  Not surprising.  Overconfident recklessness has characterized much of the Reagan campaign strategy so far and his camp has paid dearly--in Iowa and, perhaps, in New Hampshire.  The swaggering certainty around Reagan headquarters six months ago, even two months ago--based on the heady assumption that no Republican hopeful could possibly come within spitting distance of ol' Ron--has proved crippling.</span></p> <p><span>The disaster of Iowa has shot through his campaign--softening up the tough old man and leaving him wide open for a knockout punch.  But Iowa may not have turned out the way it did if Reagan had stepped on the brakes, mingled with the crowds more often, and at the very least, stopped speeding long enough to participate in the Republican debate in Des Moines in January.</span></p> <p><span>Back then though, Reagan strategists were still sunning in the August polls that had Reagan leading with 48 percent and George Bush pocketing a whopping 1 percent.  John Sears, Reagan's top strategist, figured it was wisest to keep his man out of the fray (judging from Reagan's predilection for erratic public behavior.  Sears had a point)--and retain the image of the untouchable front-runner.  \"It won't do any good to have Reagan going to coffees and shaking hands like the others,\" Sears explained before the Iowa caucuses.  \"People would get the idea that he's an ordinary man like the rest of us.\"</span></p> <p><span>So Reagan spent no more than 45 hours campaigning in Iowa, behaved almost as though <i>he</i> were the incumbent.  The Iowans interpreted it--rightly, perhaps--as a slap in the face.  They--and the Bush people--slapped back.  As for the debates--which Reagan claimed he avoided because they might divide the party--58 percent of Iowa's voting adults watched that night and they all remembered--and few appreciated--Reagan's absence.</span></p> <p><span>Reagan could only wince and explain that his was a \"national candidacy\" as he watched the returns roll in from the farm precincts of Iowa.  \"I'm in a different state every day--I've got a national constituency, and I've got to work to maintain that.  George Bush had to stake his all on the early win,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>But earlier last year Reagan's national planners were saying something quite different.  They were counting on knocking out any serious opposition early on--like in the first three primaries.  But at the time, Sears and other Reagan backers thought only Baker and Connally could threaten the candidate.  Sears brushed off Bush as a man with no constituency in the GOP.  \"If Reagan wins early, that's the ball game,\" William Russo, political coordinator for Sen. Robert Dole (R-Kan.) agreed back in October.</span></p> <p><span>But the ball game is still on.  If Reagan does not come away with some sure wins in New Hampshire and Massachusetts his base in the icy Northeast will be less than secure and some of the frost could spread to Alabama, Florida and Illinois--the ex-Governor's strongholds.</span></p> <p><span>(Aloofness clearly didn't wash in Iowa and Reagan's managers have shifted tactics in New Hampshire.)  They added more campaign stops to the Granite State schedule.  But for Reagan promoters, exposure is as dangerous as isolation.  The public blunders four years ago attest to that--on Rhodesia, Reagan proclaimed in 1976 that the United States should send in the troops.  Or, digging back still earlier, in November 1966, when he told conservative <i>Human Events</i> that 'Social Security ought to be voluntary.\"  A year earlier in the <i>Washington Star</i>, he offered this analysis of Earl Warren's abilities:  \"I think he's a lousy justice.\"</span></p> <p><span>In a state as politically tuned as New Hampshire, Reagan's gaffes have been especially troubling.  Whether they like it or not, Granite State voters are exposed to every comment and every poll.  You knew what the guy from Manchester had on his mind at the Gun Owners of New Hampshire forum when he stood up to question Reagan:  do you still think that ethnic jokes are funny, governor?</span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile, wife Nancy--extolled by the Manchester Union Leader as the woman we all should strive to be--has contributed some complimentary remarks of her own about the \"white folks.\"  The latest University of New Hampshire poll has Reagan four percentage points behind Bush, and indicates that the gap between the two men is growing steadily.  The comments are adding to a new perception:  Reagan as a reeling, slipping old man, about to give way to the new, tweed-capped Superman who spent some time in Peking.</span></p> <p><span>Reagan's problem is largely age--but not so much biologically as rhetorically and ideologically.  He speaks from a creaking, World War II perspective; his rhetoric has a rusty edge to it--broadcast from a different, simpler day when things didn't insist on being complicated.  In New Hampshire, it may prevail but in the real world, it is losing its appeal.</span></p> <p><span>Reagan draws a stark battle front:  the Common Man versus Big Government.  But the language is no longer enlightening--if in fact it ever was.  Even Thomas Paine wasn't sure who the Common Man represented and Big Government is a moldy slogan, particularly when the opponents are thrusting around \"geopolitical linkage\" to wow the crowds.</span></p> <p><span>Wherever he goes, Reagan brings with him a deck of 4 by 6 prompting cards, printed neatly with parables and short quips.  When cornered to speak on the issues, his answers are hard to distinguish from the one liners.  Blockade Cuba.  Give business a free hand.  Forget about making deals with the Russians, Hang on to the Panama Canal.  \"We built it.  We paid for it.  It's ours and we are going to keep it.\"</span></p> <p><span>Economics is an uncomplicated matter, Reagan assures his listeners.  Just end deficit spending.  \"This is the single cause of inflation, and inflation is the cause of recession.\"  (He revealed this insight four years ago in Kennet High School in Conway, N.H., before a rapt audience.)</span></p> <p><span>Taxes?  \"The key to restoring the health of the economy lies in cutting taxes.\"</span></p> <p><span>Energy?  \"The problem isn't a shortage of fuel; it's a surplus of government.\"</span></p> <p><span>Chrysler?  \"What's wrong with bankruptcy?\"</span></p> <p><span>Iran?  The U.S. has to be respected \"so no dictator will dare invade our embassy.\"</span></p> <p><span>Reagan's stance on domestic social issues reflects his belief in local, private controls.  Reagan fells welfare with one clause--reduce welfare cheating by returning it to the states.  On national health insurance, Reagan announced in <i>Private Practice</i>, a medical magazine, \"Virtually all Americans have access to excellent medical care today.\"  Such a rosy outlook endears Reagan to some, but a growing number of disaffected attribute both the style and content to the gathering clouds in a graying cerebrum.</span></p> <p><span>His fogginess makes it easy for staunch conservatives to choose to place their votes elsewhere in the quite extensive array of arch-conservative Republican candidates.  Few real issues significantly separate him from his GOP competitors.  A January survey of 225 corporation presidents conducted by Dun's Review showed as much support for Bush as for Reagan, Connally and Anderson combined.</span></p> <p><span>In New Hampshire, the <i>Manchester Union-Leader</i> is, not surprisingly, pouring buckets of ink behind Reagan.  Meanwhile, over at his Concord, N.H., headquarters, staffers seem uneasily confident.  Two people man Regan's Concord headquarters; an enormous man in a black leisure suit, hand scratching his expansive belly, and an exceedinly elderly woman, a little worried that someone has stopped by to talk.</span></p> <p><span>\"I think Mr. Reagan will start to pick up now--everybody likes him,\" she says.  \"Iowa showed we have to work,\" her friend adds.</span></p> <p><span>That is the simplistic formula for Reagan success--counting on voters scared by the close Iowa finish to turn out and work.  It's a chance, the same chance Howard Baker is depending on.  But in Reagan's case it may prove dangerous.  His support three months ago was a mile wide and an inch deep; people told pollsters they were for Ronald Reagan because they had heard of him.</span></p> <p><span>Once Bush moved out of the asterisk category, however, Reagan found out just how flimsy a lot of his support was.  To win it back, he will have to dance farther and farther to the right--a trick that even if successful in New Hampshire and Florida, could spell disaster in Massachusetts and some midwestern states.</span></p> <p><span>Whatever he's done in the last two months has failed.  Trying to stay high and dry above ths slush lost him Iowa.  Descending into it has been an excursion into ethnic cracks and racial slurs.  Sixty-nine year old Reagan insists that he's not tired but his actions belie those claims.</span></p> <p><span>If Reagan's \"national constituency\" does not assert itself by the time Florida rolls around, it will be time to put the former actor out to pasture.  They said it in '76, when he almost scared Gerry Ford out of the nomination, but this time it's for real.  If he's going to capture enough votes to be taken seriously, Reagan will have to hire more than a few pollsters to set him straight again.  Only then will he dare to step out of the motor-cade, without fear of being run over by a sweat-suited Bush</span></p>"}
{"title": "Jerry Brown and His Vision | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Jerry Brown believes he has found himself, but everyone else is having a little trouble.  If he could only demonstrate that he's pulled himself together into one piece, everything might start falling into place.  But for now, Brown is having his troubles on both sides of the country.  Every time he flits off from Sacramento to join the pack rats in New Hampshire, the shit hits the fan.  His lieutenant governor, Mike Curb, has developed a nasty habit of confirming federal judges and making policy decisions while Brown darts through the Concord mills.  And, trailing badly, Brown cannot afford to stay at home.</span></p> <p><span>In New Hampshire, Brown is skidding through a less-than-coordinated campaign.  Once the 1976 <i>wunderkind</i> who humbled Jimmy Carter in several late primaries, the Brown caravan has attracted little interest this time around.  Brown organizers had visions of college students abandoning their studies, boarding the buses and heading to Manchester for the winter.  A nice dream, but it hasn't happened.  Brown's late effort in the Maine caucuses brought him 13 per cent of the Democratic vote.  Supporters say he's got to pull at least that much in tomorrow's contest.  But the latest Boston Globe poll finds the California governor a distant third with a measly 6 per cent.  It is time, as the Brown people will tell us Wednesday morning, to reassess the campaign:  facing the inevitable might be a better description.</span></p> <p><span>Brown's strategist thought they had it all figured out.  Their candidate showed surprising strength in 1976, when he captured primaries in California and Maryland and performed in Oregon, proving he could take Carter's measure in a head-to-head contest.  The president, the Brown scenario went, would take care of Ted Kennedy--if and when he ran--sometime in the early going.  With Kennedy knocked out, Brown would step in as the only viable alternative to another four years of a Carter White House.  No such luck.  The Brown war chest, says press secretary Larry Powers, is \"down to the bottom.\"  But the candidate himself seems little concerned with such mundane matters when The Universe is waiting to be dealt with.  \"Right now,\" Powers concedes, \"the campaign is sort of schizophrenic.\"</span></p> <p><span>Like his campaign, Brown's stance on the issues strikes many as confusing.  Leave aside the commitment to Zen and the \"Linda Ronstadt number.\"  Brown takes positions many label unusual.  He advocates placing private citizens on the board of directors of the major oil companies and laying out billions for a new American space program.  Although he opposes development of the MX missile, nobody can quite find a place for Brown on the foreign policy scale.  For the record, he pictures himself a social liberal and fiscal conservative; he loudly supports a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget and favors tax-cutting schemes like Proposition 13.  He figures to draw a lot of New Hampshire's seacoast votes with his strong and consistent opposition to nuclear power, resenting recent Kennedy efforts to \"steal away the issue.\"</span></p> <p><span>But Jerry Brown's vision of a \"New Economic Order\" does not seem to be drawing in the votes.  His chief problem remains the \"small is beautiful,\" save-the-whales and damn-the-torpedos image he has built for himself.  \"He's a man,\" says G.B. Trudeau's Rick Redfern in yesterday's Doonesbury, \"who takes positions not because he believes in them, but because someone told him he had to have a few to run for president.\"  What Democrats don't want is an easy target.  And with that kind of sentiment prevailing, Jerry Brown isn't going anywhere but back to Sacramento.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Those Tough Kennedy Battles | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Elaine Madigan--fortyish, two kids, a house on the outskirts of Nashua, N.H.--likes what she hears.  She's sitting in her neighbor's living room, drinking coffee at 8 p.m. on a Sunday night and listening to Joan Kennedy talk about the campaign.  Tomorrow, Elaine will pack the kids off to school and vote for Ted Kennedy.  Kennedy, she says, has \"all the leadership qualities that Jimmy Carter lacks.\"  She is worried about heating her home this winter and about her kids being sent off to fight in the Persian Gulf.  She is fed up with talk from the White House, tired of the man she labels \"Mr. Rosalynn Carter.\"</span></p> <p><span>Up in Manchester, N.H., in Ted Kennedy's headquarters, the campaign troops are hoping that somewhere out in all those hills, there are enough Elaine Madigans to keep Jimmy Carter from getting 50 per cent of tomorrow's vote.  That's the stated goal of Ted Kennedy's New Hampshire campaign coordinator, Dudley Dudley.  Three months ago, people would have chuckled in horror at such predictions.  But now, like a crippled grizzly with traps on both legs, Ted Kennedy is struggling through the New Hampshire grind.  The candidate himself looks tired, a much different man from the one who stood in Faneuil Hall November 7 and promised to bring the Carter administration to its knees.</span></p> <p><span>Well, Senator, a boston TV journalist quipped to Kennedy about two weeks ago, \"just about everything that could go wrong with your campaign has gone wrong.\"  Kennedy smiles for the camera and starts to talk about the \"uphill battles.\"  Pressed to critique his own campaign since his announcement, Kennedy concedes that there is one thing he surely would not do again:  he would not buy another one of those expensive jets to campaign in.</span></p> <p><span>People in the Kennedy organization now talk about nothing but \"tough fight\" and \"uphill battles.\"  They guard against making predictions.  They wonder what's going to happen.  Three months ago, they were too busy celebrating the long-awaited declaration of candidacy to actually sit down and think.  They learned their lesson in Iowa, where Jimmy Carter pledged and phoned and sabre-rattled his way to a victory that drained the blood from Kennedy's face and brought a virtual halt in contributions.  Things are different now; the organization is scrambling to get money and get organized.  The candidate is trying not to yell.  Kennedy now thinks before he answers.</span></p> <p><span>***</span></p> <p><span>Joel Dubowik of Nashua standing in the same room as Elaine Madigan, listening to Joan Kennedy speak.  Joel thinks that Ted Kennedy has done some pretty good things in the Senate.  He likes the way Kennedy stands on foreign policy and energy issues.  He doesn't think that Chappaquiddick can be held against the candidate.</span></p> <p><span>But Joel is a member of the National Rifle Association and he thinks Ted Kennedy wants to take away his guns.  \"I think he's against guns because of his brother's death and I can't blame him,\" Joel says.  Were it not for the gun issue, he repeats, he thinks he would vote for Kennedy.  \"He's a helluva nice guy.\"</span></p> <p><span>The senator himself stamps his feet on the asphalt outside a machine tool plant in Keene.  It is cold as hell in western New Hampshire in the middle of February and Kennedy, like the reporters who have been waiting in the snow for 45 minutes, is trying to keep warm.  The campaign \"event\" has been closed to the press; the issue that most of the workers asked him about, Kennedy says, is gun control.  The senator is not happy; the National Rifle Association, he says, has put together an \"active, serious campaign, distorting and misrepresenting my position on this issue.\"</span></p> <p><span>Over at the New Hampshire Highway Hotel, Dick Riley, director of the Gun Owners (GO) of New Hampshire, insists that the NRA, the nation's most powerful lobby, is not paying for the bumper stickers that the folds in the crowd are holding.  \"If Kennedy Wins, YOU LOSE.\"  (Black on Day-glo Orange) \"Ted Kennedy Drives Women to Drink.\"  (White on Fire Engine Red) GO of New Hampshire, he tells me, is backing a new group called GO Against Kennedy.  The organization ran ads in Shotgun News and GunWeek and used the money it brought in to pay for the stickers.  That evening, during a Republican-stocked candidates' forum, Ted Kennedy is everyone's devil incarnate.</span></p> <p><span>Ted Kennedy's strong stands on the strong issues will not win him many votes tomorrow.  Kennedy, after all, voted in favor of Medicaid-funded abortions and wrote the bill on the Saturday Night specials.  In the process, he earned the enmity of the nation's most powerful single-issue lobbies and now the big lobbies are funneling big money against him in revenge.</span></p> <p><span>Kennedy's 17-year-old progressive Senate record cannot be lightly dismissed; many of his colleagues consider him the single most effective lawmaker on Capitol Hill.  But with advantages of pointing to experience come the disadvantages of not being able to slide too far on the issues.  In New Hampshire, Dudley says, she doubts whether the \"gun control votes\"--her label--would fall on Kennedy's side in any case.  Other organizers worry more and, like nervous players glancing the clock, wait for tomorrow night's returns and hope for the best.</span></p> <p><span>***</span></p> <p><span>The Kennedy campaign now knows what it's like to fight an incumbent.  Time and again, Kennedy taunts, threatens and cajoles, eager to smoke out Carter from his Oval Office perch and watch the president become human again.  Aren't you tired of surrogates carrying the president's message?  Aren't you tired of radio and television images?  Don't you feel insulted?  Some organizers say the backlash vote -- the soft Carter support, the people who aren't too high on Kennedy but wanted to see the president in the flesh--may be high.  The real test of the campaign, Kennedy predicts, will come when Carter leaves the White House.  In the meantime, Kennedy is studying hard.</span></p> <p><span>For his part, Carter has slipped from the roost only once, descending into the political pit to label Kennedy's comments on Iran \"damaging to the country.\"  But the Rose Garden strategy, as Carter's miraculous two-month turn about shows, has never worked better.  At the mere mention of a word--\"hostages\"--the network cameras roll, and Carter is there, in your living room, talking tough, talking in prime time, talking about the thing that people are interested in.  The rally-round-the-flag quotient, Kennedy Massachusetts organizers say, has fallen from it Iowa high, but no one doubts that it still exists.</span></p> <p><span>The problem with Kennedy's strategy, people whisper in your ear, is that it never existed.  We've got a candidate who's two-to-one up in the polls and he's a Kennedy, organizers thought.  Who needs a game plan?  But as Carter's stay-at-home-and-manage-the-country tactics threatened to bury the senator's campaign, Kennedy's advisers armed their candidate with major policy addresses tailored to sharpen his attacks on the president and draw the media's eye.</span></p> <p><span>With the new tactics have come stronger positions.  The Carter and Brown people say he's changed his tune, that Kennedy supports things he couldn't pronounce two months ago.  Kennedy's organizers disagree.  \"Sometimes you change positions because of the dynamics of the world,\" says Gerard Dougherty, the Boston lawyer who's been shipped out to run the Kennedy effort in Illinois.</span></p> <p><span>At Georgetown, Kennedy lashed out at Carter's inflation and energy record, supporting what he terms \"last resort\" moves of gas rationing and wage and price controls.  More recently, Kennedy \"defined\" his position on nuclear power, coming out in favor of a moratorium on new plant construction.  To audiences across the state, he proudly displays his own energy plan, which stresses conservation, solar and low-head hydro power.</span></p> <p><span>In New Hampshire, however, most voters care about guns and butter.  \"I've got sons that are draft age,\" one woman tells me, \"and I don't want them fighting for gas and oil.\"  Kennedy says the president shouldn't be re-elected \"just because he happened to be standing there when his foreign policy fell apart.\"  Kennedy opposes draft registration; Kennedy supports a random system to draft both men and women.  He supports the president's requested 3-per-cent hike in defense appropriations but draws the line elsewhere; he is for developing the concept of the MX missile, but not deploying it, for a foreign policy that stresses preventive measures and not one that \"says Soviet troops are unacceptable and then accetpts them\"</span></p> <p><span>***</span></p> <p><span>Ted Kennedy is running two hours behind schedule -- the norm, not the exception -- when he is introduced by the head of the Stevens High School Committee for Kennedy.  The last stop was Claremont Senior Congress Park, where, voice rising, face redenning and hands gripping the podium, he ticked off his record of pushing aid to the elderly, all to a crowd that featued not one natural non-gray hair.  Now, he's pitching the young people in the high school auditorum.</span></p> <p><span>The kids have been sitting still for a couple of hours.  When Kennedy tells them they ought to have a \"chahnce\" to enter the political arena, his Boston Brahmin accent draws more than a few murmurs.  Kennedy raises his voice when he talks about the programs that he really cares about.  Like national health care.  The voice booms, \"Every member of the United States Congress goes to the Senate dispensary and gets their little health care needs taken care of in full, and we don't pay a cent for it.\"  The crowd quiets down.  \"One out of seven of you are going to die of cancer,\" he warns.  But the kids aren't really listening.  They are turning to their neighbors, counting groups of seven and picking out which one of them it will be</span></p>"}
{"title": "Bush Follows The Peanut Trail | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><i>The candidate is early and there is a twinkle in his steel blue eyes as he realizes he has caught the press corps unprepared.  The scurrying photographers amuse him.  As he smiles, he looks like a younger Henry Fonda, at once aristocratic and plebian, handsome and ordinary.  He hops on the back of a red pickup truck and moves to a small podium.  \"I'm George Bush\" he says, \"and I'd like your support.\"  In a slow northeastern twang, he talks of issues and Iowa, occasionally pounding the podium and moving to the climax of his speech.  \"I'm optimistic about this country,\" he says.  \"I know we can turn things around.\"  John Connally can go back to the ranch, Howard Baker and Bob Dole can go back to the Senate, Philip Crane and John Anderson can go back to the House and Ronald Reagan can go back to being Ronald Reagan--but \"by gosh,\" George Bush wants to be president.</i></span></p> <p><span>Jimmy Carter brought the American people drive, personal style and a new face in 1976 and George Bush has them all this time around.  The former CIA chief and ambassador to the United Nations is openly and unabashedly copying Carter's come-from-nowhere '76 strategy.  Grab the early contests, catch the attention of the media, and write your own convention ticket.  Bush has followed the peanut trial well and the gameplan is working even better the second time around.</span></p> <p><span>Four years ago Iowa made Carter a credible candidate; this year, it made George Bush an instant frontrunner.  The media discovered George Bush.  The day after his January 21 victory, Bush was \"on the move,\" and on the cover of every major newspaper in the country, not to mention Newsweek, The New York Times Magazine and countless political journals.  When the media discovered George Bush, so did the people.  The fallout from the Iowa publicity has been a meteoric rise in the polls.  A Newsweek poll conducted a week before the caucuses showed Reagan annihilating Bush, 45-6 per cent nationwide.  Two weeks later, with the caucus history, a second poll showed Bush trailing Reagan 36-27.  In what many believe to be strong Reagan country, a Boston Globe poll shows a one per cent Bush lead in New Hampshire.  The Reagan camp has shifted gears, but many think it may already be too late.</span></p> <p><span>If Sears and Reagan had stepped out of the blinding California sunshine early last January, they would have changed their strategy for Iowa.  Bush had nabbed most of the party's volunteers, and the other candidates were scrambling for leftovers.  Bush was campaigning as if he were running for Governor; he and his wife visited 86 of the state's 99 counties.  Nationally, Bush had resurrected the Ford campaign machine that sent Reagan home in 1976 and hired Ford's campaign manager, James B. Baker.</span></p> <p><span>Reagan is campaigning this time around, but the Bush organization is well-primed.  Newly found funds, flowing into campaign coffers since January 21, financed a TV advertising blitz.  The organization's efficiency can be gauged by the ultimate variable--the candidate's contact with the people.  In his last full day of Granite State stumping, Bush, to the consternation of the press, arrived at each destination five minutes early.  The candidate was fully briefed and flawless.  At a local high school he cited a poll from the previous week and at the Rochester Elks Club he knew the names of all the Big Elks and even some of the little ones.  In each town, Bush referred to the times he'd visited during the previous year.  By the end of the day, the reporters were wondering if the campaign hired an understudy who camped out in the state that summer and fall.</span></p> <p><span>Bush's speeches are upbeat and optimistic.  They focus on solutions and \"turning the country around,\" whereas Reagan's are harrangues on the nation's ills.</span></p> <p><span>The two men share many of the same positions; but their public statements, as Roy Reed wrote in the Times magazine, are very different.  Reagan's position on the Panama Canal:  \"We built it.  We paid for it.  It's ours.\"  Says Bush:  \"I understand trying to break out of colonialism.  I understand that you don't go out and cut a swath through another guy's country to build a canal.  But I think it's of overriding importance that the United States keep its commitments, and that's the reason I oppose the treaty.\"  On paper it may sound like so much politicizing but from the podium, the voters tell you, this man sounds sincere.</span></p> <p><span>It is the sincerity both of a statesman and the guy next door whom you can invite over for a barbecue.  George Bush is the friendly family doctor who specializes in frequent house calls.  Ronald Reagan, meanwhile, is the chief surgeon operating on an anesthetized, failing patient.  And if you believe George Bush, Americans don't want to be told they're dying.  Bush's product is a conservative clothed in a moderate's rhetoric.  He supports registration for the draft but denounces \"war talk.\"  He opposes SALT II on the ground it is based on Carter's perception of the \"world as he wishes it were and not as it is.\"  Yet he states that SALT III would be the driving force behind his administration.</span></p> <p><span>His domestic policy follows the same conservative line, balanced by moderation.  In the short term, the onetime Texas congressman supports the development of nuclear power hand in with the development of fundamental safeguards to insure against disaster.  But in the long term, Bush declares, \"We will have to explore solar energy.\"  He supports ERA but opposed extension of the ratification deadline.</span></p> <p><span>Bush's economics combine a balanced federal budget and a reduction in federal spending.  To tighten American belts he proposes stricter eligibility requirements for federal programs like Food Stamps and grading federal programs on their efficiency.  Programs that consistently received low marks, he says, would be revamped or eliminated.</span></p> <p><span>To keep the economic wheels turning, Bush supports a windfall profits tax and a tax cut to stimulate investment in the economy.  The most soothing element in the Bush dosage, however, is the packaging.  Bush states his measures of austerity as one he \"honestly believes\" have to be taken.  He says it once again:  \"We're going to have to do things to turn this country around.\"</span></p> <p><span>Bush's appearance--the \"middle-aged but fit\" look--further draws the line between him and Reagan.  He is 56 years old and prides himself on telling voters that he feels 35.  Standing next to 69-year-old Reagan, he <i>does</i> look 35.  His ubiquitous personal and political background has proved a great asset to the effort.  The man is from everywhere.  He is the son of Prescott Bush, former millionaire senator from Connecticut.  Bush can genuinely identify himself as a New Englander, a preppie, an Ivy Leaguer, a Texan, a southerner or a westerner--and he does.</span></p> <p><span>Politically his background is just as checkered.  Bush was the Republican's utility infielder, a ballplayer who has never held one position long enough to know it well or to be able to be judged by his performance at that slot.  In a short six years, from 1971 to 1977, Bush was chief delegate to the United Nations, National Chairman of the G.O.P., chief envoy to Peking and director of the Central Intelligence Agency.  The public does not seem to mind this grocery list of short-term administrative posts; Bush bills himslf as a leader \"the country won't have to train,\" and most polls give high marks to his potential ability to deal with major problems, particularly in foreign affairs.</span></p> <p><span>If Bush's resume has convinced the public, it has not impressed New Hampshire's leading newspaper, the <i>Manchester Union-Leader</i>.  William Loeb's daily front-page editorials sing the praises of Reagan and report in vivid terms what Loeb calls \"Bushgate\"--allegations made to the Watergate special prosecutors in 1974 that Bush accepted over $100,000 in illegal campaign contributions from a secret Nixon slush fund.  The charges were thrown out of court.  But Loeb's paper is widely read, and in past elections his support has shifted votes.</span></p> <p><span>George Bush has been stung by \"Bushgate\" and he jumps at the opportunity to deny any wrondoing.  But his real concern is following his carefully-laid game plan.  Bush hopes to recreate Jimmy Carter's successful drive to the presidency; he knows that Ronald Reagan cannot survive a second humiliation.  But if he is to march triumphantly to Detroit in July he must run ahead of Reagan tomorrow or next week.  To keep his candidacy moving, George Bush must hold to his campaign plan.  That game plan leaves no place for defeat</span></p>"}

But rational calculations of the value of the 42nd most populous state in the nation just don't cut it in New Hampshire, a nightmare Never-Never Land where winners lose and losers win, where perception is reality and reality is irrelevant.</span></p> <p><span>New Hampshire votes tomorrow, and half-a-hundred trends, meanings, insights and revelations will be gleaned from the wisdom that its 200,000 or so voters bestow.  More than two candidates will claim victories, moral or otherwise, and at least one will call it quits.  The primary, as is its wont, will mark a watershed in this campaign, separate wheat from chaff, get the ball rolling, shift the momentum, be the straw that broke the camel's back or prove the turning point.  But no matter how it turns out, New Hampshire will be judged by the mythos which have surrounded this poly-sci microcosm and given it the dubious privilege of determining political fortunes.</span></p> <p><span>Because no one really knows what to expect, New Hampshire's pronouncement will be unexpected; that's how it's supposed to be.  Like any self-respecting essentially random group of human beings, the voters of New Hampshire are perverse and capricious.  And right now, the President of the United States, three senators, two congressmen, one governor, two ex-governors and one random bureacrat--named Carter, Kennedy, Baker, Dole, Anderson, Crane, Brown, Reagan, Connally and Bush--are scared to death of them.</span></p> <p><span>***</span></p> <p><span>What is New Hampshire?  An almanac calls it a \"relatively small but well wooded and scenic state of mountains, lakes and rapid rivers that provide a good water supply and large hydroelectric-power potential.\"  About a million people inhabit its 9304 square miles; only six states are smaller.  The state motto, which by a Supreme Court decision may be taped over on license plates by citizens who object, is \"Live Free or Die.\"  State flower:  purple lilac; bird:  purple finch; tree:  white birch.  Populated by Indians before the Europeans arrived in the 1600s, New Hampshire became the ninth state to ratify the U.S. Constitution in 1788 and the one that made that document legal.  A fifth of the state consists of public parklands, which, along with 17 miles of coastline, attract half a billion dollars in tourism annually.  Low tax rates have brought an influx of industrial development.  While the 424-member (most in the nation) legislature meets in Concord, the capital, Manchester is the largest city and home of the <i>Union Leader</i>, the largest newspaper.</span></p> <p><span>Politically, the state tends to the conservative and hawkish, but the proportionally huge number of Independents (160,000 registered as of last September, compared with 177,000 Republicans and 146,000 Democrats) reflects its notorious unpredictability when primary time rolls around.  New Hampshire rarely makes the New York or Washington papers between presidential election years--except for protests against the nuclear power plant under construction in Seabrook or for the \"Volvo International\" tennis tournament in Bretton Woods--but it is never far from the hearts and minds of ambitious politicians or those who chronicle them.  (Ever seen a column called \"Two Years to Utah\"?)  The federal grants and friendly phone calls pour in.  Other primaries and caucuses--with the increasingly notable exception of Iowa--can be put off; but New Hampshire is mandatory, a rite of passage for unknowns and incumbent presidents alike.  It gets real cold up there and snows a lot:  the bones creak when you have to be up by six every morning to shake hands with stone-bored workers at some shoe factory.</span></p> <p><span>***</span></p> <p><span>New Hampshire began giant-killing in 1932, when New York Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt '04 snatched all eight Democratic delegates from front-runner Alfred E. Smith.  Twenty years later, Senator Estes Kefauver's upset nudged President Harry S. Truman into retirement.  When LBJ and Muskie flunked the New Hampshire test, they merely continued a time-honored tradition.</span></p> <p><span>Even as it levels death blows at the over-confident, New Hampshire gives an incalculable boost--in publicity and attention, credibility and money--to candidates who emerge unscathed.  Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, the war hero, finally forced to declare his party, <i>blitzkrieged</i> Robert Taft in 1952; John F. Kennedy '40 impressed regulars by mopping up in 1960; it's after New Hampshire that the survivors start giving their aides funny looks, wondering who's going to fit in which Cabinet slot.  Sometimes New Hampshire just plays the <i>non sequitur</i>:  with two hot-to-trot Republicans (Barry Goldwater and Nelson Rockefeller) breathing down their necks in 1964, Granite State voters gave an easy victory to Henry Cabot Lodge, then U.S. Ambassador to South Vietnam, of all places, conducting a long-distance (10,000 miles) write-in campaign from Saigon.</span></p> <p><span>If past history holds up, hundreds of reporters will devote more than half the articles written in the <i>entire</i> Presidential campaign to this primary.  They'll record the obscure and trivial and, thus, memorable moments of New Hampshire, simultaneously tearing at and reinforcing the larger-than-life mystique of the quadrennial Quest for the Holy Momentum.  Like a fellow named Edward \"Ned\" Coll, who distinguished himself from other Democratic candidates at a televised debate two days before the 1972 primary by waving a large rubber rat at the cameras and declaring, \"This represents the real problem of violence in America.\"  Or \"Laugh-In\" comedian Pat Paulsen's short-lived write-in campaign.  Remember Sam Yorty's 1972 New Hampshire bid?  No one else does.  Last time around, another gaggle of absurdist candidates spiced the winter grind:  Stanley \"Vote Alphabetically\" Arnold (290 votes), the Rev. Arthur \"We need to put Jesus Christ back into politics\" Blessit (886 votes, or 1 per cent), Robert L.  \"Elect the Last President and Give America Parliamentary Government\" Kelleher (113 votes), and the anti-Communist ticket of Billy Joe Clegg and Auburn Lee Pack-wood of Springfield, Mo. (188 votes).  This year, Ronald Reagan's paltry attempts at humor will have to provide the comic relief.</span></p> <p><span>Possibly the most cherished quote to come out of New Hampshire was Eugene McCarthy's epitaph for George Romney, the Michigan governor whose highly-rated candidacy had fallen apart after he admitted being \"brainwashed\" by the Pentagon on Vietnam.  Did McCarthy think the August 1967 remark had destroyed Romney's chances?  \"Well...er no, not really,\" replied the Senator.  \"Anyway, I think in that case a light rinse would have been sufficient.'\"  (Romney \"kept on campaigning in the same way a dead man's fingernails keep growing,\" wrote Timothy Crouse '68 in <i>The Boys on the Bus</i>--but withdrew shortly before New Hampshire voted.)</span></p> <p><span>***</span></p> <p><span>This year, the formula changed somewhat when the Iowa caucuses, held January 21, firmly established two frontrunners before New Hampshire had its say.  But while losing a little of its thunder, Tuesday's race has attracted the intense media coverage political observers have come to expect.</span></p> <p><span>David L. Halberstam '55 once called New Hampshire the \"land of journalist overkill,\" and few would disagree.  For politicians, pundits and mere voters groping for some tangible indication of which would-be Wizard of Oz to follow down the yellow brick road to the White House, New Hampshire fills a psychological void.  New Hampshire takes the vague preconceptions and sets them in bold type; where conflicting polls lose meaning, the neat, unchanging rows of figures give everyone something to latch on to as gospel.  \"The people have spoken, the fools.\"</span></p> <p><span>To capture those people, the has-beens, stillares, will-bes and never-weres spend hundreds of thousands of dollars, degrade themselves in public, shake the hands of people they don't know or care to know, plaster friendly if sickly grins on their faces and fit themselves into a mold designed to \"maximize\" appeal.  Little is sacred, because though the sacrifices are great, the reward--a pot of political gold--casts a spell not easily resisted.</span></p> <p><span>Jimmy Carter couldn't resist.  A \"personal and confidential\" memorandum from Hamilton Jordan, dated August 4, 1974, helped finalize Carter's decision to run and captured New Hampshire's significance in, as it were, a nutshell:</span></p> <p><span>The press shows an exagerated interest in the early primaries as they represent the first confrontation between candidates, their contrasting strategies and styles, which the press has been writing and speculating about for two years.  We would do well to understand the very special and powerful role the press plays in interpreting the primary results for the rest of the nation.  What is actually accomplished in (the) New Hampshire primary is less important than how the press interprets it for the nation.  Handled properly, a defeat can be interpreted as a \"holding action\" and a victory as a mediocre showing.</span></p> <p><span>It worked.  Carter, already encouraged by the reception given his showing in Iowa, escaped with 30 per cent of the vote and 13 delegates, seven points and nine delegates ahead of liberal Arizona representative Morris Udall.  Birch Bayh, Fred Harris and Sargent Shriver trailed behind, while Henry Jackson missed the boat by not running.  His credentials validated, Carter had broken out in front to stay.</span></p> <p><span>Private citizen Richard Nixon, trooping through Keene and Concord and Durham and Manchester with his USC Mafia, in the winter of '68, also knew what he had come for.  His media barrage tried to portray a \"New Nixon,\" matured from the days of Checkers and \"last\" press conferences, a wise and respected statesman well-suited to deal with a changing and complex world.  But what about sex appeal?  That could be a problem.

This warm visual image will be supported by strong reader copy that, point by point, will sell his qualifications to voters who can study the advertisementleisurely in their own home.</span></p> <p><span>Some didn't fall for it.  Ed DeCourcy of the Newport, N.H., <i>Argus-Champion</i>, wrote:  \"There is no New Nixon.  What we have here is the old Nixon, a little older.\"  New or old, Nixon swept to a virtually uncontested victory in the Republican primary.  Attention was focused elsewhere in the winter of 1968.</span></p> <p><span>A very weird year.  \"There was a sense everywhere, in 1968,\" Garry Wills wrote in <i>Nixon Agonistes</i>, \"that things were giving.  That man had not merely lost control of his history, but might never regain it.\"  That feeling permeated the New Hampshire campaign of Eugene McCarthy.  Seeing a chance to \"change the world, rearrange the world\" and drive Lyndon Johnson back to the ranch, hundreds of student supporters invaded the state.  Huntley-Brinkley brought Vietnam home every night in living color, and the McCarthy kids knocked on doorfronts to remind New Hampshire that now was the chance to stop it.  The Johnson write-in effort functioned in a stupor; McCarthy's army--which the Senator bemusedly termed \"the government-in-exile\"--pulsed with energy.  \"Those people were <i>angry</i>,\" remembered Gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson in <i>Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail</i> '72.</span></p> <p><span>The other side of the \"Clean for Gene\" coin was a nervous sense of <b>truce</b> that hung over the New Hampshire campaign.  In backroom late night talks at the Wayfarer there was no shortage of McCarthy staffers who said this would probably be their final trip \"within the system.\"  There were some who didn't mind admitting that, personally, they'd rather throw firebombs or get heavy into dope--but they were attracted by the drama, the sheer balls, of McCarthy's \"hopeless challenge.\"</span></p> <p><span>McCarthy received 23,380 votes (42 per cent) on a snowy March 12, Johnson 27,243 (49 per cent).  After New Hampshire, the incumbent, who gained a victory in name only, knew his popular support had eroded.  On March 31, Johnson announced that he would not seek another term.</span></p> <p><span>In 1972, George McGovern played the same numbers game McCarthy had, with equal success.  The first to declare for the Democratic nomination--more than a year before New Hampshire--McGovern quietly built a youthful but highly efficient organization even as poll after poll showed negligible progress.

{"title": "The Draft and the Poor | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>To the Editors of The Crimson:</b></span></p> <p><span>It is disturbing that perhaps the strongest arguments in favor of reinstating the draft have not been mentioned either by the Carter administration or by the members of the press.  Instead, almost all of the public discussion has thus far been limited to the implications of the draft for military and international affairs.  However, it is worth noting that a return to military conscription is important not only because our nation needs to have its conventional forces strengthened, but rather primarily because of the requirements of social equity and democracy.</span></p> <p><span>The current \"volunteer\" army is a disgraceful institution for any country that actively advocates an egalitarian social order.  In reality, this method of military selection is merely a cruel hoax perpetrated upon the poorer classes of society, since these are the people who are forced into the military by their lack of jobs and other opportunities.  A system whereby poor people are forced by economic necessity to risk their lives for the benefit of society at large is hardly egalitarian.  The current composition of the army--30 per cent black and other third world people, the remainder largely poor and uneducated--reflects the result of this cruel exploitation at the hands of a middle class who can afford to hire mercenaries.</span></p> <p><span>The volunteer army also frustrates the aspirations of the poor and disprivileged in another way as well; the budgetary strain imposed upon the federal government by the costs of economic incentives to keep people in the armed forces ultimately leads to cutbacks or curtailments of social programs for the needy.  Institution of the draft would allow the current force levels to be maintained at a fraction of their present cost in wages and benefits.  The funds that would be released by these savings could go towards programs that would, say, create more jobs for the unemployed youth in our cities.</span></p> <p><span>Another reason for reinstitution of the draft is largely political:  do we want to have a standing professional army?  For example, would we have found out about My Lai or the secret bombings in Cambodia if no unwilling and uncommitted inductees had been in the armed forces at the time, ready and willing to risk blowing the whistle on these illegal acts?  A citizen army, representing all classes, races and ethnic groups, would be an institution that would more closely adhere to the values, and ultimately, the will of the American people.</span></p> <p><span>The final argument for conscription is a social one; in the wake of the 1970s and the \"Me Generation\" style of thought, we need a social institution that will revive the concept of public service among our people.  A mandatory system of national service (like the ones that France, Germany and Switzerland have, for example) would allow every young person the opportunity to serve our society either in the military or in another form of public service (e.g., Peace Corps, Vista, hospital volunteers, community organizing, etc.).  The human resources and enthusiasm that this system would channel into constructive tasks would be considerable.  This might make possible programs to clean up the environment and rebuild our cities that would have been far too expensive even to contemplate attempting if everyone who participated had to be paid with tax dollars.</span></p> <p><span>In conclusion, the draft is not merely a manifestation of jingoistic saber rattling.  In addition to its military and strategic significance, it serves to advance many progressive causes right here in the United States.  It would be a mistake if our generation chose to narrowly pursue our own self interests (as upper-middle class youths who may face the draft but would never be forced into the \"volunteer army\") rather than our larger responsibility to the less privileged members of our society. <b>Matthew M.

{"title": "Bouncing Back | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>F</b>OUR MONTHS AGO, the American press asked Jimmy Carter to drop out of the presidential race to make room for Teddy Kennedy.  At that time, Kennedy led all polls by 40 points.  But 14 weeks later, Carter has turned a remarkable political somersault.  He defeated Kennedy 59-31 in Iowa, and has a chance of repeating his performance in New Hampshire, although Carter pulled a four-point advantage in Maine.</span></p> <p><span>Carter's gymnastics may not yet be over.  The tables turned once, and they could turn again.  Unpredictable circumstances gave Jimmy Carter the edge, and they could take it away.  The seizure of hostages created a major crisis in Iran, giving him the image of a President under pressure, and diverting attention from domestic issues.  The Russian invasion of Afghanistan augmented the impression that Carter faces a more difficult foreign situation than any recent President.  The hesitation which formerly hurt his leadership quotient seems to have carried him upward in the popularity polls since these developments.</span></p> <p><span>But the traits that have recently helped Carter--his restraint and caution--could once again turn against him.  Carter still has the problems he had as a candidate in 1976.  Unlike Kennedy, he has no solid power base he can count on; Kennedy was beating him in the South 2-1 in October.  If the hostages should die or events turn against him, Carter could be in trouble.</span></p> <p><span>When the international crisis atmosphere that currently preoccupies the nation dissipates, voters' attention will turn back to domestic issues.  Unemployment is once again on the rise and there are signs of recession for this summer.  Meanwhile, inflation continues and it is almost certain that before 1981 there will be a new oil crunch with more gas lines and impatience.  The press will soon attack Carter for allowing the artificial period of American unity to slip away without the institution of an emergency energy policy.  The advantages of being the incumbent could quickly become disadvantages.  Kennedy's recent Lazarus speech presented a clear economic policy.  It will be heavily debated, but at least his price and wage control suggestion is on the table.  If the economy continues to falter, the heat will be on Carter to construct a coherent policy.</span></p> <p><span>Carter has other potential problems.  In his Georgetown address, Kennedy finally let his liberal colors fly as he grasped for policies to set him apart from Carter.  The speech may not have picked up any new votes but it did awaken a national press corps that clearly looks to the left.  (The press has recently focused more on Kennedy's prolems than on his criticisms of the President but this could change as Kennedy puts some ideological distance between himself and the President.)</span></p> <p><span>Kennedy needs the help.  His Iowa defeat showed an organization that was not properly prepared.  Kennedy has staked his comeback on a victory in the New Hampshire primary.  He has a large and hardworking team there, but it might not be enough.  In New Hampshire Carter has had an organized group led by J. Chris Brown (the head of Carter's successful '76 effort) working since last summer.  He has the support of Governor Hugh Gallen and a majority of the state legislators.  He has already pumped Federal grants into the state for highway and railway improvements.  In addition, there are hints that the hostages might be returned in time for the New Hampshire race.  If Carter can once again turn a primary into a referendum on his Presidency.</span></p> <p><span><b>B</b>y promising victory, Kennedy's comeback team may have made a mistake that could haunt them.  Kennedy should have said immediately after Iowa that the first big primary he would point toward would be New York, two months down the road, thereby giving himself breathing room.  He should have pointed out that a candidate needs 1700 delegates to take the convention, that there are 37 primaries ahead, and that the winner cannot be predicted by a few early caucuses.</span></p> <p><span>Kennedy's needed victory is still possible.  New England voters are fickle and take their candidate's visits very seriously.  Kennedy has spent the last weeks in those states, while Carter has sent Vice-president Mondale and wife Rosalyn to the states but has not set foot there himself.  If the President can't convince the voters that a crisis continues he might have to start campaigning and debating like the rest of the candidates.</span></p> <p><span>Carter has returned to his position as the man to beat, but he is not invincible.  If Kennedy can hang onto his campaign sled in the snows of Maine and New Hampshire, events might turn his way.  A two-man Democratic race might be an advantage to the party at this stage.  A Kennedy dropout would leave a single target for Republican snipers.  But Kennedy has not quit, and his staff remains focussed on the domestic issues that will rise to the fore with a break on the international scene.  As they say in politics, it ain't over yet.  Hang on to your convention tickets.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Danger in Paradise | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>RYING HIS BEST to impale viewers with his cold blue-eyed Oval Office stare and firm-voiced Leader of the Free World righteous indignation, Jimmy Carter lashed out at his primary Democratic opponent last Wednesday night.</span></p> <p><span>In doing so, he showed the symptoms of a curious disease that afflicts Presidential contenders who unexpectedly find themselves in an ostensibly commanding position.  Call it \"The Perils of Prosperity,\" after the book, or \"The Paradise Syndrome,\" after the <i>Star Trek</i> episode; however described, the arrogance of front-runnership can be dangerous--and Jimmy Carter has a bad case of it.</span></p> <p><span>At his first press conference since November, Carter responded to two criticisms from Sen. Edward M. Kennedy '54 (D-Mass); specifically, that Carter had come over only lately to the idea of a commission to settle the Iranian crisis and that Afghanistan \"might not have happened\" if the President had shown the Soviets more resolve and paid more attention to the signs of impending invasion.</span></p> <p><span>\"It's not my inclination to respond to every allegation--erroneous allegation--that Senator Kennedy has made,\" Carter began.  So far, psychologically correct:  a continuation of the Rose Garden strategy that has proved so effective and so desperately frustrating to Kennedy, Carter had maintained the cool, unflappable image of a leader above the fray.</span></p> <p><span>But then he lost control; political impulses, carefully repressed and sublimated in public even while the hot-line burned between Washington and Des Moines, Portland and Manchester, got the best of him.  Kennedy's statements, he went on, \"have not helped our country.\"  When the hostages were originally taken, Carter said.</span></p> <p><span>Senator Kennedy insinuated that because we had given medical treatment to the Shah that somehow the seizure of our own hostages was not the fault of the terrorists who took them, but the fault of the United States.</span></p> <p><span>Senator Kennedy has also said that the invasion of Afghanistan was not only not very serious but that somehow or another the Soviets were not the culpable party, but the United States was at fault, and somehow caused or contributed to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.</span></p> <p><span>And more recently, he has insinuated--again falsely--that some action or lack of action on my part or the United States' part had perpetuated the incarceration of American hostages.</span></p> <p><span>The thrust of what he said throughout the last few weeks is very damaging to our country, and to the establishment of our principals and the maintenance of them, and the achieving of our goals to keep the peace and to get the hostages released.</span></p> <p><span>When people expect the worst from a president, an adequate or mediocre response takes on an aura of grandeur; Carter seduced the national press (\"lights at the White House burned into the night\") as effectively as he did the voters of Iowa.  Carter appreciates how wide his support has become, but not how thin it remains.  By going for the jugular, he hoped to capitalize and exploit the popularity he has gained by not going off the deep end over the past four months, which in these times passes for a substantial accomplishment.  Yet when so minor an achievement can inspire the dramatic turnabout of political fortunes witnessed since Iran--Kennedy's two-to-one lead now reversed--it reflects a shallowness of commitment to either candidate rather than firm support for one.</span></p> <p><span>The frontal assault on Kennedy showed that Carter does not perceive this.  He not only believes the polls, he trusts them, and felt some sharp thrusts at Kennedy's patriotism would bury him (not to mention having press secretary Jody Powell charge him with an \"unrestrained display of political ambition,\" of all things).</span></p> <p><span>But pulling the plug on Kennedy's candidacy is a delicate operation, one that Dr. Carter may be in the process of botching.  Overestimating his support and the leeway it gives him, Carter revealed his vulnerability last Wednesday; he played right into Kennedy's hands by allowing himself to be baited into a shouting match that either side may lose.  Carter went for the kill; the result was overkill.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE SIGNS OF IMMINENT TROUBLE for the current front-runner loom elsewhere.  Carter campaigners are less than adept at poor-mouthing--reducing expectations so the results look good.  Immediately after Iowa, political wisdom had it that Kennedy would be out of it if he didn't win both Maine and New Hampshire.  yet his competitive defeat in the Maine caucus ended up as a moral victory, and now Carter is in the historically unenviable position of heading the pack into New Hampshire.  Lyndon Johnson needed a big win here in 1968, Ed Muskie in 1972; Eugene McCarthy and George McGovern refused to give it to them, and the campaigns turned in favor of the two narrow losers.  Unless Carter repeates his Iowa performance, gaining a majority, the momentum will shift.</span></p> <p><span>Voters do not like to be taken for granted.  Dealt a political straight flush in a card game no one understands, Jimmy Carter may be overplaying his hand.  He's already shown he can't keep a poker face.</span></p>"}
{"title": "A Deceiving Lull In The Registration Battle | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Even now, almost eight weeks after 3.6 million 19- and 20-year-old men surrendered their names, address and social security numbers to the Selective Service System (SSS), you cannot say for sure who won the initial skirmish over the issue of military registration.  Both sides claim victory, but neither the government nor the leadership of the anti-registration forces expects to rest in the months ahead.  Both camps are planning new assaults, priming fresh troops for the front lines.  Cries of \"We have not yet begun to fight\" echo across the temporarily inactive battlefield.</span></p> <p><span>When Jimmy Carter first trumpeted his registration plan last winter, he warned of an increasingly aggressive Soviet war machine and a disorganized all-volunteer American counterpart, one incapable of responding efficiently to the Communist threat.  Despite this frightening description and the public's gradual shift toward a more bellicose outlook as problems in the Near East continued to smolder, no one was certain that America's youth would cooperate with Carter.  The SSS announced its version of the outcome last week:  more than 93 per cent of the nearly four million eligible men had registered, and more were expected to do so in the near future.  SSS Director Bernard D. Rostker humbly declared a triumph, saying, \"I am not unhappy.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Not so fast!\"  shouted many of the youthful activists who struggled all summer to hinder Rostker and his overworked crew of name-collectors.  \"The Selective Service is lying,\" says David Affler, a spokesman for the Boston Alliance Against Registration and the Draft, and one of the many protesters who claim that the government presented faulty figures.  He says Rostker's numbers do not account for such variables as recent demographic changes and fraudulent registration cards, submitted by Michael Mouse, Donald Duck and others.  After suggests that a more accurate estimation of the response to registration is 75 per cent, a figure <i>The Boston Globe</i> published two weeks ago after conducting a survey of scattered post office districts containing 11 per cent of the national population.</span></p> <p><span>But Rostker counters, \"Our numbers are as hard as a rock.  They have the anecdotes and the guesses.  I have the cards and the numbers.\"  Rostker, who claims that only a survey encompassing the entire country yields accurate registration statistics, gladly welcomed the General Accounting Office audit of his totals that Barry Lynn, head of the national Committee Against Registration and the Draft (CARD), proposed.  The SSS chief adds that in an independent check of his own for phony signees, \"We had a problem with fewer than one in every 1000 cards.\"  He says that only 1.8 per cent of the registrants announced they were complying under protest.</span></p> <p><span>While some opponents of registration chide Rostker for covering for his boss in the White House, organizers such as David Landau '72, an American Civil Liberities Union attorney and the deputy director of CARD, have chosen to concentrate on what the government's figures mean, and on the prospects of halting the process before it leads to its logical end:  a military draft.</span></p> <p><span>Landau points out that more than a quarter of a million young men signed up after the official two weeks had ended, and like them, many others carefully thought out their reasons for registering before heading for the post office.  \"We mounted a highly successful movement.  Two years ago there was little thought about this.  Now we have CARD, plus 400 anti-draft groups around the country.  The movement is visible, and the connection between registration and the draft is visible,\" Landau says proudly.  \"We never insisted that people screw up their lives by committing a crime.  We just wanted them to know about the facts and their options.\"</span></p> <p><span>Although Landau takes credit for helping postpone the draft \"for at least a year instead of two months,\" he still fears that Congress may eventually push for formal induction.  Preemptive maneuvers include a National Anti-Draft Week (October 12-18), complete with teach-ins and lectures, and a national CARD convention in late February somewhere in the Midwest.  The group will organize a march on Washington in the spring if the registration program survives.</span></p> <p><span>And here is where Landau warms to his favority subject--the possibility that by early next summer the Supreme Court will have ended the registration process because it includes only men.  In addition to the sexual discrimination case before the high court (which stems from a suit filed in Penn-sylvania nine years ago) the ACLU has taken the government to Federal District Court in Washington on an alleged violation of the Privacy Act.  Landau explains that the SSS did not follow the specific procedures for \"incorporation by reference\" in its collection of registrants' social security numbers.  Saying that the ACLU is very optimistic about both encounters, Landau adds, \"No one will buy the erroneous assertion that the defense system will fall apart without registration,\" and that, particularly in the case before the Supreme Court, \"The government's tone of hysteria will not help.\"</span></p> <p><span>Anti-registration/draft organizers in the Boston area echo Landau's continued enthusiasm.  Joe Gerson, a Cambridge representative of the American Friends Service Committee, a national group that has worked with CARD to educate young people about registration, says the Friends will concentrate on minorities, particularly working-class Blacks, in their drive to disseminate information on the issue.  \"The white middle class is usually the target, but they often already know what is going on,\" says Gerson, adding that he will also include high school students in his counseling sessions.</span></p> <p><span>He emphasizes, however, that \"the issue of the draft is hardly resolved--you don't just register for the fun of it.  It would be rather naive to assume that this will not lead to something else.\"  If a draft is proposed, Gerson says he believes it will be \"eminently defeatable.\"  \"We have shown that there is resistance, and that people are thinking about the issue.\"</span></p> <p><span>In the meantime, the government, and specifically the Department of Justice, has another problem to worry about:  the more than 250,000 19- and 20-year olds who are officially guilty of a felony that boasts a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $10,000 fine.  Dean St. Dennis, a Justice Department spokesman, refuses to speculate as to how his men might round up so many loose mavericks, let alone what they would do with all of the young offenders if the law ever caught up with them.  \"We certainly have not developed any sort of big program (to track down non-registrants),\" St. Dennis says, adding, \"Voluntary compliance remains a highly cherished goal.  Just because we contact someone who failed to register, that does not necessarily mean there will be a prosecution.\"</span></p> <p><span>Rostker agrees heartily, adding that he hopes to continue signing up late-comers without the hassle of formal legal action.  \"We are in no hurry,\" he explains.  \"If there is someone out there who has not registered, we will go and get him.\"  None of this personal courting will begin until after the last confirmation letter goes out in late November.  At that time the SSS will urge those young men who did not receive a letter to sign up.</span></p> <p><span>Presumably, hold-outs will be referred to the Justice Department.  Bob Mills, a staff member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, insists that the confusion over Justice's enforcement responsibilities must be straightened out sooner rather than later.  Legislation for future registration will require that the SSS explain to Congress just how it and the Justice Department plan to discipline those who signed up late, or who never signed up at all.  \"The implication is that there are a lot of felons out there, and a lot of people around here are wondering what will happen to them.\"  Generally, though, Mills says, \"There has not been much talk around here since July.\"</span></p> <p><span>By the end of the year Rostker promises a new \"media blitz\" to pump up the permanent registration program he will launch in Januray.  \"Things have gone smoothly:  we have come in at below our cost estimate (about $2 per person).  We are certainly better prepared militarily,\" concludes Rostker.</span></p> <p><span>All of this could, of course, change if someone other than Jimmy Carter were sitting in the Oval Office next year.  Ronald Reagan and John Anderson have declared strong opposition to peace-time registration.  The determined pro-and anti-registration warriors realize that in the space of a few months the entire framework of their confrontation may shift drastically, but they march on, certain that they are each serving the nation and that they will prevail over the opposition.</span></p>"}

Rusty Staub--dubbed \"Le Grand Orange\" by Francophones who adored his carrot-colored hair--provided patient fans with at least a few thrills.  Gene Mauch, the greatest manager never to win a pennant, gave the baseball intelligentsia strategic gems to discuss in bistros.</span></p> <p><span>Even the organist and the P.A. announcer got into the act, the former establishing a reputation as the best in the majors and the latter bouncing backup catcher John Bocabella's sonorous name off the tiny stadium's cheap steel seats (\"Et maintenant, numero 12, Jahn...Boc...a..bellll...a).</span></p> <p><span>Then Kenny Singleton went North and switch-hit his way into the <i>coeurs</i> of Montreal, Tim Foli brought spunk to the shortstop position, and Ron Hunt leaned into every ball hurled his way, setting a new record for being hit by pitches.</span></p> <p><span>Those were the little things, the things that, together with the novelty of big-league baseball, allowed Les Expos to pour money into their farm system as fans poured through the turnstiles.  A few years later, the system seems to have worked.</span></p> <p><span>* * *</span></p> <p><span>Unlike so many other teams that float into the upper echelons, the Expos have still maintained their unrefined manner, their distinct character.</span></p> <p><span>Any team that features Spaceman Bill Lee, outspoken Ron LeFlore, gutsy Gary Carter and the enigmatic Ellis Valentine will be an interesting assemblage.  Any team managed by the inimitable Dick Williams, matched only by Billy Martin in the ranks of contentious skippers, will surely have a certain <i>joie de vivre.</i></span></p> <p><span>But the bottom line is the win column.  And the Expos are winning, mostly behind a rotation consisting of Scott Sanderson, Steve Rogers, David Palmer, Bill Gullickson and Charlie Lea--a rotation which not so long ago labored for Memphis in Double-A ball.</span></p> <p><span>LeFlore has snatched 90 bases, Rodney Scott has furnished additional speed, and farm products Larry Parrish and Warren Cromartie have hit consistently.</span></p> <p><span>With Elias Sosa coming out of the bullpen to douse late-inning rallies, the Expos have so far been able to stave off opposition from the defending champion Pirates and the talented, well paid Phillies.</span></p> <p><span>With a slim one-game lead, the Expos cannot afford to wax complacent.  Nothing, however, can compare to the ordeal of last September, when the division crown narrowly eluded the squad which played 31 games in 28 days.</span></p> <p><span>The deep pitching staff and a superhuman effort kept them close, but when the season boiled down to a crucial series with Philadelphia, the Expos' bats went flat.</span></p> <p><span>Still, last fall's experience should stand Montreal in good stead this time around.  The addition of LeFlore gives the offense the explosiveness it has lacked.</span></p> <p><span>And the naysayers who predict Canada will crumble might be wise to wait--at least until after the World Series.

But as the enterprising reporter digs deeper into the story, he comes to realize the ugly, brutal truth, horrifying through it may seem.  Could it be that Dean Rosovsky is unwittingly a Yale spy?</span></p> <p><span><i>The Spike</i> takes this idea, adds best-seller ingredients, and transposes it to a more timely bipolar conflict--that of the United States and the Soviet Union.  The latest ads for <i>The Spike</i> goad the public into paying 13 bucks to read what the \"liberal journalist establishment\" has almost universally panned.  See what those sullied liberal press types are scared of, the ad continues.  After all, chances are that those who reviewed the book in the liberal publications are <i>tyomhaya verboura:</i></span></p> <p><span>...an unconscious source....  This type of person serves Soviet interests and works under KGB control without realizing what he is doing.  Lenin used to call such people useful idiots.  Without being conscious KGB agents, they are often in a position to accomplish far more for the Soviet Union than the people who are knowingly working for us.</span></p> <p><span>Of course, those reviewers and columnists may be principal agents--<i>osnovny</i>--or merely trusted persons--<i>doveryonnoe listo.</i>  In either case, with their help, the help of the American liberal establishment and of frivolous laws like those which limit CIA powers, the Russkies are on their way to world domination.</span></p> <p><span>Or so Arnaud de Borchgrave and Robert Moss, impeccable journalists and fledgling novelists, would have us believe.  Their paranoid world-view is peculiar; it suggests that the Soviet Union could, by sowing the seeds of \"disinformation\" in the American press, influence public opinion so that it could achieve world hegemony without so much as aiming a nuclear weapon at New York.  By simply urging Western journalists to follow their own instincts--by encouraging them to expose covert CIA activities, for example--the Soviets can immeasurably further their interests, and drive Western Europe out of the U.S. sphere of influence into their grimy hands.</span></p> <p><span>But that is just one facet of The Plan--Plan Azev to be precise--that threatens to sap America's international influence.  This KGB grand design includes infiltrating Western governments with moles--double agents--who do things like conveying classified documents through microdots on the back of chewing gum wrappers sent in packages to orphans in East Germany.  No kidding.</span></p> <p><span>Robert Hockney, hotshot editor of the <i>Berkeley Barb</i> during the student uprisings of the late'60s, prize-winning Vietnam reporter and the first journalist to rip the veil off the CIA, and (naturally) handsome stud, wends his way from New York to Paris to Humburg to London and then back to Washington in search of the elusive \"truth.\"  As the authors tiresomely tell us, he faces a most disquieting question:  Were all his earlier journalistic <i>tours de force</i> fed to him indirectly by the Russkies?  Was his CIA expose planted by Soviet spies?  Was his much-heralded interview with a North Vietnamese guerilla leader a set-up?  Has he been an instrument of Soviet perfidy?</span></p> <p><span>De Borchgrave is regarded in media circles as somewhat of a prince, <i>Newsweek's</i> chief foreign correspondent who regularly conducts penetrating interview with world leaders, often ferreting out slivers of information no one else gets.  Moss edits <i>Foreign Report,</i> a trenchant publication associated with London's conservative <i>Economist.</i>  He has written two other books that received positive reviews, but this is the first attempt at fiction for the reporters.  It shows--their writing undermines their well-conceived plot.  Too often their characters approach cliche, the writing is choppy, and when they reach for poetry, they come up with doggerel.  They're at their worst when they describe the women characters in the story-all stereotypes.  There is Tessa Torrance, national sex symbol turned terrorist sympathizer; Julie Cummings, the young woman on the move who takes Capitol Hill by storm; Nguyen Canh Lani, the NLF supporter devoted more to her cause than her men; and Astrid Renard, the voracious nymphomaniac.  They all enjoy sex.  They are all beautiful.  Clearly, this bipolar world is a man's world.</span></p> <p><span>Not-surprisingly, the journalists are at their best when depicting characters based on authentic figures.  Their portrayal of President Billy Connor from Flats, Mississippi, his ignoramus friend named Timmy, and the \"Mississippi Mafia\" borders on the hilarious and hits awfully close to home.  Or there's Sen.  Seamus O'Reilly, a not-too-subtle Moynihan clone who seems to represent the authors' fondest hopes in this world gone awry.  But the protagonist, Hockney, is not exactly believable.  He decides at graduation that he wants to do investigative work, and with a minimum of effort becomes a renowned journalist.  He is extraordinarily difficult to identify with, because we get little more than fleeting glimpses at what makes him tick.  What could be a complex and moving figure is instead an empty observer who evokes little reaction.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE SPIKE ITSELF is a newspaper term that refers to the metal spike on which editors impale copy they decide not to print--for different reasons, including when they do not sympathize with its politics.  It implies bias by omission, and calls into question the meaning of \"objectivity\" in journalism.  The two celebrated writers who wrote the book have a straightforward answer:  Objectivity doesn't exist.  When Hockney first discovers the Soviets may be influencing the American media, his editors shelve the story.  In the authors' bipolar world, if you're not with us, you're against us.</span></p> <p><span>De Borchgrave and Moss argue that the overstressed  \"Vietnam syndrome\" has systematically silenced anyone who dares to question detente and the Soviets' motives-- this is, voices of moderate Republican reason have been shouted down by those who cry McCarthyism.  But if the two European journalists were to take a close look at the right in America today, they would probably shed fewer tears.  Anti-Soviet rhetoric, increased defense spending and conspiracy theories are <i>de rigueur</i> these days, and Ronald Reagan may ride into office on their public appeal.</span></p> <p><span>And who really cares if the vice president of the United States in an unwitting Soviet dupe?  We probably have a few of our own in the Kremlin anyway.  <i>The Spike</i> is a provocative book a cut above routine spy thrillers and conspiratorial yarns, but it overflows with self-important people who think <i>they</i> are making a difference, pulling the strings and waging the <i>real</i> war.  For all we know, they are.  But <i>The Spike</i> fails to prove it.  It doesn't sufficiently create that someone-is-watching-you quality, it does not suck you in and scare you; it makes you feel like a captive audience to a spectacle you've seen before.  Evil was never so banal</span></p>"}
{"title": "King Of the K-School | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>It is a dog day of Cambridge's sweltering summer, the day after Teddy Kennedy with-drew from the presidential sweepstakes.  But the pleasantly air-conditioned Kenned School of Government is abuzz with activity as on most other days, figures rushing through snakelike corridors, stopping briefly to salute one another, filling the Forum with its recognizable murmur.  To a detached observer, these people exude a slightly self-important air--but they also give the impression that they have places to <i>go.</i></span></p> <p><span>Four years ago, Graham T. Allison Jr. '62, dean of the Kennedy School, thought he too had a place to go:  Washington.  But, he explains now, President Bok's persuasion prevailed over other forces, and he turned down a post in the Carter administration to take the helm of the Kennedy School.  Since then, he has presided over a period of vigorous expansion and sometimes vigorous controversy at the school that some have labeled the pet project of Bok's presidency.</span></p> <p><span>As the K-School grows, Allison necessarily has lost the ability to remain in close touch with everyone who walks through the polished glass doors on Boylston Street, something he seemed able to do in the program's more intimate days.  Somewhere along the line, he has acquired a reputation among some as a distant but diligent manager.  The K-School has come quite a ways since the summer of 1969, when a small group of \"concerned faculty\" patiently ironed out the details of a proposal for a public policy program.  In that relatively short (in terms of Harvard) timespan, Allison too has come a long way--maybe too long.  \"Graham Allison?\"  one K-School source asks rhetorically.  \"He's the consummate bureaucrat.\"</span></p> <p><span>At first blush, the image seems hard to erase.  Allison apologizes excessively for being 20 minutes late for an appointment.  He speaks in steady, measured tones--in a sonorous voice oddly reminiscent of Dan Rather--weighing each word heavily.  He likes to order things in sets of three.  He uses words like \"prioritize\" and mouths sentences like, \"There's no model--so we're trying to define operationally a strategy for achieving that objective.\"</span></p> <p><span>His coffee table is stacked with books, his desk is cluttered with papers.  You can almost picture Allison slaving away efficiently in a dimly-lit office 90 hours a week, deriving enjoyment from pushing papers and organizing files.  There is a touch of the politician in him, as he smoothly introduces strangers and smiles expansively.  But when he says he admires \"those who run for elective positions, who are out there slugging it out, putting their own skin on the line,\" the implication is unmistakeable: Graham Allison would never be one of them.</span></p> <p><span>Last week, Allison embarked for the Soviet Union.  He had been invited by Russian officials.  In the wake of the Olympic boycott and the cooling of the cold war, however, Allison was not about to be injudicious; he called up the State Department to see if his trip was appropriate.</span></p> <p><span>Among K-School administrators, his managerial prowess is almost revered.  As Thomas Schelling, professor of Public Policy and a friend of Allison's, says, \"He's always working on the hard immediate problems.  He spends an awful lot of time doing things most of us wouldn't like to do.\"  Others, like Ira A. Jackson '71, assistant dean of the Kennedy School, bring up his tenacious application to fundraising--one of the less appealing responsibilities of a dean--during the school's high growth stage.  And since he assumed the K-School's leadership, he has plunged himself into the sea of administrative nitty gritty that has steadily deepened as programs have mushroomed.</span></p> <p><span>Even the system of governance he has constructed as dean resembles a paragon of bureaucracy.  \"The school is ruled like the island of Timor,\" Allison says.  \"Everyone sits around a big fire.  Up comes an issue.  Those most interested in that issue gather in the center of the circle.  Those in the inner circle study the matter, and bring it back to the outer circle for approval.\"  He compares faculty members to \"partners in a law firm.\"</span></p> <p><span>Allison concedes that this mechanism, aimed at decentralizing the decision-making process, will prove harder to sustain as the faculty grows larger.  In many ways, then, the signals he emits are those of the prototypical bureaucrat, a functional organizer and manager extraordinaire.</span></p> <p><span>But a current of tension runs through Graham Allison's gut, a tension paralleled in the graduate school he heads.  While Jackson describes him as \"self-effacing\" and \"remarkably unpretentious,\" he also terms him \"a bull, a tiger, a hustler, a zealot, an entreprenurial guy, an unmodified enthusiast, and a genuine one.\"  Despite his carefully controlled veneer when discussing matters important to him, Allison is \"in a fundamental way, a regular guy,\" according to Jackson.  And his style has never been to shun controversy.  In fact, he often seems to attract it, at times betraying more than a trace of bluster.  If Allison displays many characteristics associated with the \"consummate bureaucrat,\" he also has a streak of maverick individualism, sometimes, he concedes, to a fault.</span></p> <p><span>One colleague recounts a dinner party Allison attended last spring.  \"At base, Graham is a man of passion.  I asked him about the campaign.  But he had been introduced to a zoologist, and they immediately launched into an animated discussion about racoons, a few of which apparently frequent the Allison's backyard.  They talked for an hour about <i>racoons.</i>  Once he got going on a subject he clearly enjoyed, he could not be disengaged.\"</span></p> <p><span>Don K. Price, Weatherhead Professor of Government and Allison's predecessor as dean of the Kennedy School, has nothing but praise for his successor, noting in particular his fundraising skills.  He, too, detects the duality Allison's personality, an easygoing manner combined with extraordinary intentness.  \"I know Graham as an occasional fishing companion.  He's a very good, very ardent fisherman who will go with you at the drop of a hat.  He's great fun to be with, whether watching a tennis game or collaborating on a project,\" he says.</span></p> <p><span>Ardor is a trait that has revealed itself since his days as an undergraduate.  After two years spent as a Marshall scholar at Hertford College, he returned to Harvard and became an official at the fledgling Institute of Politics while working on his Ph.D. thesis, eventually published as <i>The Essence of Decision.</i>  In 1966, he acted as a decoy when Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara, the first IOP \"honorary associate,\" was beseiged by 700 angry anti-war demonstrators--the first indication that the war would not let the University rest in peace.</span></p> <p><span>In an effort to sneak McNamara past the crowd, institute officials had Allison sit in a car at the Quincy House Master's garage on DeWolfe St.  It took a couple hundred of the eager demonstrators some time before they realized the car's occupant was not defense secretary Robert McNamara, but loyal Institute official Graham Allison.</span></p> <p><span>Last October, another Secretary of Defense visited Harvard to deliver a dull address on the merits of SALT II to a more sedate group of observers.  Harold Brown had finished reciting four of his list of six reasons why SALT II was a \"significant step\" towards controlling the arms race when two surly members of the Revolutionary Communist Party interrupted his speech with a stream of obscenities.</span></p> <p><span>While Brown stepped down from the podium, his face exhibiting no emotion, Allison took a microphone beside the stage.  His voice fraught with barely restrained fury, he warned, \"If you don't shut up right now, Secretary Brown will leave.\"  The audience proved more receptive to the administration position than another gathering has 13 years before.  As applause drowned out the hoarse, profane shouts of protest, Graham Allison made his way up to the K-School forum's second tier and personally escorted the rabble rousers out of the building.</span></p> <p><span>Allison sticks to his guns.  \"Students, of all people, should be exposed to a broad range of perspectives.  Not to hear any counterarguments is wrong,\" he says.  \"But simply to distrup...you're within your rights to ask questions, even to have a short argument.  But you're not within your rights to shout and scream.\"</span></p> <p><span>Another incident involving Allison and \"the right to shout and scream\" took place year before the Brown incident.  The occasion was the dedication of the $11 million building for the K-School, and the plans for that day were grand.  But about 400 demonstrators chanted throughout Bok's address, protesting the naming of the school's library for Charles W. Engelhard--a magnate who earned much of his fortune in South African gold-mining.</span></p> <p><span>The days leading up to the dedication were filled with tense, round-the-clock negotiations between student groups demanding that one member of the organizing groups be allowed to speak at the ceremony, and several administrators, including Allison.</span></p> <p><span>In his address at the building's inauguration, Allison said at the beginning that a representative would only be allowed to speak if the protestors \"respected the dedication.\"  Drowning out the University's president with chants does not exactly coincide with Allison's idea of respect.  But the ceremony's featured speaker, Ted Kennedy, played politician and told the crowd of more than 5000 he and his family would assuredly stay to hear a spokesman chosen by the demonstrators, adding that he hoped the rest of the audience would remain as well.</span></p> <p><span>Spokesman Mark Smith '72-4 gave a rousing speech denouncing apartheid following the end of the ceremony.  It made the network news.  K-School officials reflected later that Allison and his fellow negotiators had been trapped by the Senator's politicking.</span></p> <p><span>But the Engelhard library issue did not filter away from the k-School as quickly as the throngs did.  Jackson estimates Allison spent more than 500 hours dealing with the controversy.  Schelling recalls the issue in vivid terms, saying, \"It was a terrible blow, a stunning shock to the whole school.  It was an exceptionally difficult political and diplomatic problem, on both sides.  He (Allison) was under enormous pressure from alumni threatening to withhold money, deans of other schools who saw it as an important precedent, and concerned faculty and students.\"</span></p> <p><span>By the time a committee had hammered out a solution in late May, the Engelhard issue had exhausted all concerned.  Allison and his team devised a classic compromise--the library would not be named after Engelhard but a commemorative plaque would be hung on a library wall.  Schelling says, \"We came out not unscarred but well and healthy.\"</span></p> <p><span>Allison comments ingenuously on his role in the conflicts that have dotted his career.  \"Sometimes maybe I've erred in failing to be sensitive enough to the concerns of some constituents who feel deeply about, and even offended by, the presentation of ideas.  There is danger in a University environment of being too cautions about confronting ideas.  My approach is not to shy away from ideas,\" he says.</span></p> <p><span>\"There's nothing chicken-hearted about Graham Allison,\" Jackson says, adding, \"He's a tenacious, dogged apostle of points of view, but is mature enought to modify or correct his point of view when opposing arguments prevail.\"  Schelling points out that the dean's position often shrouds his inner self.  \"A lot of people probably find him a little distant, harsh, overbearing, or thick-skinned.  To do his job he <i>has</i> to be--most of us are not good at giving people bad news, but as dean he is fully responsible for all the hard decisions,\" Schelling says, evoking questions about the island of Timor arrangement.</span></p> <p><span>The same way that Allison's personality seems a split between bureaucratic and entreprenurial prototypes, the K-School is undergoing a process of introspection and uncovering a dual strain:  training students to manage effectively and to think creatively.  But in summing up the K-School's goals, Allison cannot resist listing three major aims:  competence in public management, understanding of basic public policy issues, and encouraging people to \"think hard about the aims and limits of government.\"</span></p> <p><span>And in the same way that Allison has been freed of many of his taxing administrative chores with the arrival of Hale Champion, executive dean, he hopes that the K-School can free itself to address larger questions.  \"I think old-fashioned questions of political philosophy will become more wide-spread,\" he says.  If they do, Graham Allison will be right in the thick of the debate, whether at a Trilateral Commission tryst or a Council of foreign Relations meeting.  He will travel to keep in touch with what he terms the \"marketplace\"--he squeezes about six appointments a day into his weekly sojourns to Washington or New York--always on the ball, hustling, but never fully forgetting his role as a model for bureaucrats.</span></p>"}

Hotels up and down Seventh Avenue gleamed a bit more brightly and familiar network faces beaming at ActionCams drew crowds of \"Hi Mom\"-ers, but most of the people, bicycles, carts and cars just stumbled along in the humidity, grumbling and snarling.</span></p> <p><span>A month ago in Detroit the allegedly reborn party of Abraham Lincoln and Jesse Helms gathered to crown its champion.  Fanatically grateful for any attention, the Motown elders cleared out one end of their city a week before Ronnie's legions arrived.  A sticky labor strike evaporated, the streets around Cobo Hall were cleaned, and everyone was so damned nice.  New York is just too tired and too grumpy to make such an effort.</span></p> <p><span>Shopkeepers and street vendors have not tempered their renowned surliness; cabbies don't bother to ask \"how ya doin', how doya like da city?\" as they did in Detroit.  The streets, even way downtown in Conventionsville, are dirtier than ever.  City Hall's half-hearted promise to round up prostitutes and other undesirables has resulted in increased police presence and improved arrest statistics but little substantial change on the sidewalks and in the alleyways below Times Square, where New York's regulars push and show to keep pace--whether or not there happens to be a convention at the Garden.</span></p> <p><span>***</span></p> <p><span>Diagonally across Seventh Avenue from the hulking home of the Knicks, Rangers, and, for a week, the Democratic National Committee, sits a blind Jew reading the Talmud (ancient biblical interpretations) in braille.  He wears no sunglasses and shamelessly allows his empty eyes to wander over the shuffling stream of pedestrians.  Every few minutes a passerby drops some coins in the old Jew's plastic dish, and he nods, mumbling a thank you.  But his crudely lettered sign does not beg for charity; it states simply, \"Blind Man's Newsstand.\" For 30 cents you do more than ease your conscience; you get the late city edition of the <i>New York Post</i>.</span></p> <p><span>It is hardened resignation to his condition, not blind trust in his fellow man, that keeps the blind Jew in the newspaper business.  \"Sure people must take two papers sometimes, or the <i>Voice</i> instead of the <i>Times,</i> but what can I do?\" In fact, he doesn't even trust you enough to reveal his name.</span></p> <p><span>After some coaxing, however, he agrees to relate his unique view of the city, the economy and the convention that will at once surround him with its color and vulgarity and be as far away as the legendary scholars whose musings he traces slowly with a dirty, calloused finger.</span></p> <p><span>\"I've been at this sport for ten, maybe 12 years,\" he begins, reluctantly closing his tattered book.  \"It's a good spot.  Lots of people pass by.  I do okay...You know, some years I make a little, more, some years a little less.  Who cares as long as you can eat?  I'm not exactly in a position to go out looking for a job. (Chuckles.) Look, life is tough... Who knows about inflation, or whatever, not me.  I try to get enough to eat.  Everyone has to struggle.  Why should this country be different?</span></p> <p><span>\"...The big difference over the years has been that people don't have time for anything anymore.  People don't stop and talk to me, you know, say a little 'hello,' a little 'how are you,' or whatever.  Everyone rushes.  Now with this convention business, even more...more rushing.  Is this a way to live?  Rushing about?  No. I don't think so.\"</span></p> <p><span>The blind Jew doesn't vote.  \"There are certain complications, and, well...complications where I live.\"  He doesn't really care who emerges from the Democratic wrestling match either:  \"So what's the difference, one from the other?  You tell me.\"  But he brightens at the suggestion that out-of-towners might stop to talk when they come upon his unusual enterprise.  \"Yeah, that would be nice.\"</span></p> <p><span>Three steps away from the blind Jew is a little Italian guy twirling an embryonic pizza at the counter of La Trattoria, one of the many sidewalk ethnic food joints which are wedged into former storefornts.  Staring aimlessly into the passing traffic, the pizzaman seems as blind as his neighbor.  Asking the pizzaman for his name seems a sure bet to end the conversation, so he too, remains anonymous.</span></p> <p><span>\"Sure (the convention) is a good thing.  Business is very good, but only for a few days.  Everything is very slow.  Nothing is right.  People doesn't have money, and they don't go out.\"  The gray blob soars dangerously close to the low ceiling, but returns with a soft slap to the pizzaman's fist.</span></p> <p><span>Questioned about the city's failure to shake off its chronic ailments--pollution, crime, unemployment, suffering--the pizzaman just shakes his head.  \"So they'll clean up a little here, for a while.  We are used to it.  The garbage is part of it.\"  His voice trails off as a co-worker notices him chatting on the job with a stranger.  Without even a nod, the pizzaman turns his back and ends the exchange.</span></p> <p><span>***</span></p> <p><span>There are, of course, many New Yorkers hanging around the Garden specifically because of what is happening or will happen inside.  James Bland, for instance, has forgotten about the bus he had to catch and will gleefully take on all comers on anything from Black unity to Ted Kennedy and the \"open convention\" gambit.</span></p> <p><span>Bland wears a bright blue fishing hat with the brim rolled up all the way around.  He carries a <i>Daily News</i> under his arm and smiles broadly as he lectures on the topic of the day.</span></p> <p><span>\"Now I'm a Kennedy man myself, been with the Kennedy boys for a while, but this open convention business is serious and separate from that.\"  Bland relishes a good smile:\" (The delegates) they're like this, see (crosses his arms in front of him) handcuffed.\"  He doesn't listen to the suggestion that the push to free delegates stinks of hypocrisy, that the same people who assailed Carter as a tyrannical slave merchant originally backed the reform which gave more power to the primary voter, that if Kennedy were the probable choice, this debate would not have surfaced.</span></p> <p><span>\"Let's not talk in 'maybes.'  All I know is that in the time between the last primary and the convention, the nominee can be thrown in jail on a rape charge, and we couldn't do nothing about it...The delegate is elected to use someone else's power.  The power has been dele-gated, right?

He wears an orange button identifying him as a member of the United Urban Party (\"We are the Balance of Power\").  He explains:  \"It's a small group based here in New York which is committed to unifying the Black peoples into a singular, powerful voice to demand improvement in places like the South Bronx.

Sitting behind a portable bridge table on the corner of Seventh and 33rd, he conducts an independent voter survey \"in cooperation with Edward Bennet Williams and his committee.\"  Sure enough, there is a sign propped up on the side of Harrow's table which depict a man bellowing, \"Call for an Open Convention.  \"Harrow is quick to add that he is not formally employed by Williams.

{"title": "The Garden:  Inside and Out | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>NEW YORK--CBS, Newsweek and Lou Harris all seemed to take my vote for granted, assuming that delegates pledged to Ted Kennedy would vote for an open convention out of loyalty to their candidate.</span></p> <p><span>And last night I did what they expected--cast my ballot for an open convention--against the advice of those who contend that \"unbinding\" the delegates would undo 12 years of reform efforts, against my own initial misgivings, and despite the probability that I risked attaching my self to a losing cause.  What motivated me, however, was not blind loyalty to Kennedy as much as an instinctive rebelliousness against tying my own hands and wielding a club over my own head--and doing the same to all future delegates.</span></p> <p><span>For a long time, Kennedy's attempts to release delegates from their commitments to support the candidate they are bound to deeply offended my sense of fairness.  It seemed to be a tawdry way to manipulate the rules in order to gain political advantage, changing the way the game was played in midstream.  The precedent deeply disturbed me.  I wondered if the change would inch us back toward a system that allowed individual delegates to hold the presidential nomination captive to personal whim.</span></p> <p><span>At first glance, Kennedy's proposal seemed both opportunistic and anti-democratic, while Carter's looked straightforward enough--simply playing fair with the voters who elected the delegates.  And yet beneath Carter's rhetoric lay a far more insidious attempt at manipulation.</span></p> <p><span>Rule F(3c) destroys any possibility of a late challenge to the front-runner's nomination.  What Democrats really did last night was to confirm, in their party at least, the tyranny of the early primaries and to make a challenge to an incumbent even more difficult than it already is.</span></p> <p><span>In 1978, the Carter-controlled Winograd Commission, charged with revamping the presidential nominating process, adopted the rule unanimously.  It is ironic that rank outsider Jimmy Carter, who used the 1976 rule to claw his way from obscurity to the presidency, supported the changes from early on.  \"They (the White House) wanted to make sure that no outsiders will do to Jimmy Carter in 1980 what Jimmy Carter did to everyone else in 1976,\" said one commission member.</span></p> <p><span>As it stands now, a delegate's position already borders on impotence.  He or she cannot place rules or platform amendments on the floor without previous approval of a convention committee, and frequently delegates do not even have much say in nominating those who serve on those important committees, as the candidates' organizations agree to each other's nominees in advance and often present delegates with an approved list \"in order to save time.\"</span></p> <p><span>Whether you call it the \"robot rule\" or the \"faithful delegate principle\" it is obvious that F(3c) removes from delegates any shred of responsibility or freedom of choice and makes their judgment completely irrelevant.  They merely become a human incarnation of the mathematical proportions of the primaries.</span></p> <p><span>With the adoption of this rule, delegates will not become truer agents of the voters, as was intended.  Before last night, delegates' chief strength lay in their ability to negotiate with their own candidate in an effort to strengthen his position on the issues they were concerned about.  They were able to do this by their legitimate claim to be acting in the name of the voters back home.  Now, they are firmly in the candidate's pockets; he can remove them--or more likely, threaten to remove them--even if they are only \"seeking\" to disagree with his policies.  More so than ever before, delegates will become the simple foot soldiers of candidate organizations, simply towing the line handed down from above.</span></p> <p><span>The significance of the struggle for an open convention extends far beyond its value as a litmus test of the political muscle of Jimmy Carter or Teddy Kennedy, or even its impact on the 1980 presidential race.  For now, the selection of a party's presidential nominee has become wholly dependent on the mathematical outcome of the state primaries and caucuses, stripping political conventions of virtually all meaning.  Conventions may not be the best method of choosing a presidential candidate, but until the entire nominating process is overhauled, the conventions remain the only way to address changes in a candidate's for-tunes between the last primary and the start of the fall campaign.</span></p> <p><span>If delegates who were in fact hand-screened by Carter's campaign organization before their election feel they want to change their preference, that probably signifies there is reason for a change.  Delegates must be empowered to decide whether a \"Billygate\" or a 21-per-cent approval rating in the polls is serious enough to justify scrapping an incumbent president, or whether such a decision requires a scandal of Watergate proportions.  With an open convention rule defeated, delegates are bound not only to candidates, but also to a stifling--perhaps even intolerable--status quo.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Don't Touch That Story--It's Unpatriotic | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>S</b>UPPOSE THERE ARE two academic centers of power vying for intellectual hegemony--call them Harvard and Yale.  Harvard, long dominant in struggles for primacy, has grown complacent.  Yale, meanwhile, has devised a cunning plot designed to wreak havoc at Harvard and pave the way for its own ultimate victory in the cold war of academia.</span></p> <p><span>The scheme takes root innocuously enough, unnoticed by the high-minded Harvard decision-makers.  When a young reporter stumbles upon the plot--known menacingly as Plan Core--and insists on pursuing the subject, he falls out of favor with his paper.  But as the enterprising reporter digs deeper into the story, he comes to realize the ugly, brutal truth, horrifying through it may seem.  Could it be that Dean Rosovsky is unwittingly a Yale spy?</span></p> <p><span><i>The Spike</i> takes this idea, adds best-seller ingredients, and transposes it to a more timely bipolar conflict--that of the United States and the Soviet Union.  The latest ads for <i>The Spike</i> goad the public into paying 13 bucks to read what the \"liberal journalist establishment\" has almost universally panned.  See what those sullied liberal press types are scared of, the ad continues.  After all, chances are that those who reviewed the book in the liberal publications are <i>tyomhaya verboura:</i></span></p> <p><span>...an unconscious source....  This type of person serves Soviet interests and works under KGB control without realizing what he is doing.  Lenin used to call such people useful idiots.  Without being conscious KGB agents, they are often in a position to accomplish far more for the Soviet Union than the people who are knowingly working for us.</span></p> <p><span>Of course, those reviewers and columnists may be principal agents--<i>osnovny</i>--or merely trusted persons--<i>doveryonnoe listo.</i>  In either case, with their help, the help of the American liberal establishment and of frivolous laws like those which limit CIA powers, the Russkies are on their way to world domination.</span></p> <p><span>Or so Arnaud de Borchgrave and Robert Moss, impeccable journalists and fledgling novelists, would have us believe.  Their paranoid world-view is peculiar; it suggests that the Soviet Union could, by sowing the seeds of \"disinformation\" in the American press, influence public opinion so that it could achieve world hegemony without so much as aiming a nuclear weapon at New York.  By simply urging Western journalists to follow their own instincts--by encouraging them to expose covert CIA activities, for example--the Soviets can immeasurably further their interests, and drive Western Europe out of the U.S. sphere of influence into their grimy hands.</span></p> <p><span>But that is just one facet of The Plan--Plan Azev to be precise--that threatens to sap America's international influence.  This KGB grand design includes infiltrating Western governments with moles--double agents--who do things like conveying classified documents through microdots on the back of chewing gum wrappers sent in packages to orphans in East Germany.  No kidding.</span></p> <p><span>Robert Hockney, hotshot editor of the <i>Berkeley Barb</i> during the student uprisings of the late'60s, prize-winning Vietnam reporter and the first journalist to rip the veil off the CIA, and (naturally) handsome stud, wends his way from New York to Paris to Humburg to London and then back to Washington in search of the elusive \"truth.\"  As the authors tiresomely tell us, he faces a most disquieting question:  Were all his earlier journalistic <i>tours de force</i> fed to him indirectly by the Russkies?  Was his CIA expose planted by Soviet spies?  Was his much-heralded interview with a North Vietnamese guerilla leader a set-up?  Has he been an instrument of Soviet perfidy?</span></p> <p><span>De Borchgrave is regarded in media circles as somewhat of a prince, <i>Newsweek's</i> chief foreign correspondent who regularly conducts penetrating interview with world leaders, often ferreting out slivers of information no one else gets.  Moss edits <i>Foreign Report,</i> a trenchant publication associated with London's conservative <i>Economist.</i>  He has written two other books that received positive reviews, but this is the first attempt at fiction for the reporters.  It shows--their writing undermines their well-conceived plot.  Too often their characters approach cliche, the writing is choppy, and when they reach for poetry, they come up with doggerel.  They're at their worst when they describe the women characters in the story-all stereotypes.  There is Tessa Torrance, national sex symbol turned terrorist sympathizer; Julie Cummings, the young woman on the move who takes Capitol Hill by storm; Nguyen Canh Lani, the NLF supporter devoted more to her cause than her men; and Astrid Renard, the voracious nymphomaniac.  They all enjoy sex.  They are all beautiful.  Clearly, this bipolar world is a man's world.</span></p> <p><span>Not-surprisingly, the journalists are at their best when depicting characters based on authentic figures.  Their portrayal of President Billy Connor from Flats, Mississippi, his ignoramus friend named Timmy, and the \"Mississippi Mafia\" borders on the hilarious and hits awfully close to home.  Or there's Sen.  Seamus O'Reilly, a not-too-subtle Moynihan clone who seems to represent the authors' fondest hopes in this world gone awry.  But the protagonist, Hockney, is not exactly believable.  He decides at graduation that he wants to do investigative work, and with a minimum of effort becomes a renowned journalist.  He is extraordinarily difficult to identify with, because we get little more than fleeting glimpses at what makes him tick.  What could be a complex and moving figure is instead an empty observer who evokes little reaction.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE SPIKE ITSELF is a newspaper term that refers to the metal spike on which editors impale copy they decide not to print--for different reasons, including when they do not sympathize with its politics.  It implies bias by omission, and calls into question the meaning of \"objectivity\" in journalism.  The two celebrated writers who wrote the book have a straightforward answer:  Objectivity doesn't exist.  When Hockney first discovers the Soviets may be influencing the American media, his editors shelve the story.  In the authors' bipolar world, if you're not with us, you're against us.</span></p> <p><span>De Borchgrave and Moss argue that the overstressed  \"Vietnam syndrome\" has systematically silenced anyone who dares to question detente and the Soviets' motives-- this is, voices of moderate Republican reason have been shouted down by those who cry McCarthyism.  But if the two European journalists were to take a close look at the right in America today, they would probably shed fewer tears.  Anti-Soviet rhetoric, increased defense spending and conspiracy theories are <i>de rigueur</i> these days, and Ronald Reagan may ride into office on their public appeal.</span></p> <p><span>And who really cares if the vice president of the United States in an unwitting Soviet dupe?  We probably have a few of our own in the Kremlin anyway.  <i>The Spike</i> is a provocative book a cut above routine spy thrillers and conspiratorial yarns, but it overflows with self-important people who think <i>they</i> are making a difference, pulling the strings and waging the <i>real</i> war.  For all we know, they are.  But <i>The Spike</i> fails to prove it.  It doesn't sufficiently create that someone-is-watching-you quality, it does not suck you in and scare you; it makes you feel like a captive audience to a spectacle you've seen before.  Evil was never so banal</span></p>"}
{"title": "King Of the K-School | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>It is a dog day of Cambridge's sweltering summer, the day after Teddy Kennedy with-drew from the presidential sweepstakes.  But the pleasantly air-conditioned Kenned School of Government is abuzz with activity as on most other days, figures rushing through snakelike corridors, stopping briefly to salute one another, filling the Forum with its recognizable murmur.  To a detached observer, these people exude a slightly self-important air--but they also give the impression that they have places to <i>go.</i></span></p> <p><span>Four years ago, Graham T. Allison Jr. '62, dean of the Kennedy School, thought he too had a place to go:  Washington.  But, he explains now, President Bok's persuasion prevailed over other forces, and he turned down a post in the Carter administration to take the helm of the Kennedy School.  Since then, he has presided over a period of vigorous expansion and sometimes vigorous controversy at the school that some have labeled the pet project of Bok's presidency.</span></p> <p><span>As the K-School grows, Allison necessarily has lost the ability to remain in close touch with everyone who walks through the polished glass doors on Boylston Street, something he seemed able to do in the program's more intimate days.  Somewhere along the line, he has acquired a reputation among some as a distant but diligent manager.  The K-School has come quite a ways since the summer of 1969, when a small group of \"concerned faculty\" patiently ironed out the details of a proposal for a public policy program.  In that relatively short (in terms of Harvard) timespan, Allison too has come a long way--maybe too long.  \"Graham Allison?\"  one K-School source asks rhetorically.  \"He's the consummate bureaucrat.\"</span></p> <p><span>At first blush, the image seems hard to erase.  Allison apologizes excessively for being 20 minutes late for an appointment.  He speaks in steady, measured tones--in a sonorous voice oddly reminiscent of Dan Rather--weighing each word heavily.  He likes to order things in sets of three.  He uses words like \"prioritize\" and mouths sentences like, \"There's no model--so we're trying to define operationally a strategy for achieving that objective.\"</span></p> <p><span>His coffee table is stacked with books, his desk is cluttered with papers.  You can almost picture Allison slaving away efficiently in a dimly-lit office 90 hours a week, deriving enjoyment from pushing papers and organizing files.  There is a touch of the politician in him, as he smoothly introduces strangers and smiles expansively.  But when he says he admires \"those who run for elective positions, who are out there slugging it out, putting their own skin on the line,\" the implication is unmistakeable: Graham Allison would never be one of them.</span></p> <p><span>Last week, Allison embarked for the Soviet Union.  He had been invited by Russian officials.  In the wake of the Olympic boycott and the cooling of the cold war, however, Allison was not about to be injudicious; he called up the State Department to see if his trip was appropriate.</span></p> <p><span>Among K-School administrators, his managerial prowess is almost revered.  As Thomas Schelling, professor of Public Policy and a friend of Allison's, says, \"He's always working on the hard immediate problems.  He spends an awful lot of time doing things most of us wouldn't like to do.\"  Others, like Ira A. Jackson '71, assistant dean of the Kennedy School, bring up his tenacious application to fundraising--one of the less appealing responsibilities of a dean--during the school's high growth stage.  And since he assumed the K-School's leadership, he has plunged himself into the sea of administrative nitty gritty that has steadily deepened as programs have mushroomed.</span></p> <p><span>Even the system of governance he has constructed as dean resembles a paragon of bureaucracy.  \"The school is ruled like the island of Timor,\" Allison says.  \"Everyone sits around a big fire.  Up comes an issue.  Those most interested in that issue gather in the center of the circle.  Those in the inner circle study the matter, and bring it back to the outer circle for approval.\"  He compares faculty members to \"partners in a law firm.\"</span></p> <p><span>Allison concedes that this mechanism, aimed at decentralizing the decision-making process, will prove harder to sustain as the faculty grows larger.  In many ways, then, the signals he emits are those of the prototypical bureaucrat, a functional organizer and manager extraordinaire.</span></p> <p><span>But a current of tension runs through Graham Allison's gut, a tension paralleled in the graduate school he heads.  While Jackson describes him as \"self-effacing\" and \"remarkably unpretentious,\" he also terms him \"a bull, a tiger, a hustler, a zealot, an entreprenurial guy, an unmodified enthusiast, and a genuine one.\"  Despite his carefully controlled veneer when discussing matters important to him, Allison is \"in a fundamental way, a regular guy,\" according to Jackson.  And his style has never been to shun controversy.  In fact, he often seems to attract it, at times betraying more than a trace of bluster.  If Allison displays many characteristics associated with the \"consummate bureaucrat,\" he also has a streak of maverick individualism, sometimes, he concedes, to a fault.</span></p> <p><span>One colleague recounts a dinner party Allison attended last spring.  \"At base, Graham is a man of passion.  I asked him about the campaign.  But he had been introduced to a zoologist, and they immediately launched into an animated discussion about racoons, a few of which apparently frequent the Allison's backyard.  They talked for an hour about <i>racoons.</i>  Once he got going on a subject he clearly enjoyed, he could not be disengaged.\"</span></p> <p><span>Don K. Price, Weatherhead Professor of Government and Allison's predecessor as dean of the Kennedy School, has nothing but praise for his successor, noting in particular his fundraising skills.  He, too, detects the duality Allison's personality, an easygoing manner combined with extraordinary intentness.  \"I know Graham as an occasional fishing companion.  He's a very good, very ardent fisherman who will go with you at the drop of a hat.  He's great fun to be with, whether watching a tennis game or collaborating on a project,\" he says.</span></p> <p><span>Ardor is a trait that has revealed itself since his days as an undergraduate.  After two years spent as a Marshall scholar at Hertford College, he returned to Harvard and became an official at the fledgling Institute of Politics while working on his Ph.D. thesis, eventually published as <i>The Essence of Decision.</i>  In 1966, he acted as a decoy when Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara, the first IOP \"honorary associate,\" was beseiged by 700 angry anti-war demonstrators--the first indication that the war would not let the University rest in peace.</span></p> <p><span>In an effort to sneak McNamara past the crowd, institute officials had Allison sit in a car at the Quincy House Master's garage on DeWolfe St.  It took a couple hundred of the eager demonstrators some time before they realized the car's occupant was not defense secretary Robert McNamara, but loyal Institute official Graham Allison.</span></p> <p><span>Last October, another Secretary of Defense visited Harvard to deliver a dull address on the merits of SALT II to a more sedate group of observers.  Harold Brown had finished reciting four of his list of six reasons why SALT II was a \"significant step\" towards controlling the arms race when two surly members of the Revolutionary Communist Party interrupted his speech with a stream of obscenities.</span></p> <p><span>While Brown stepped down from the podium, his face exhibiting no emotion, Allison took a microphone beside the stage.  His voice fraught with barely restrained fury, he warned, \"If you don't shut up right now, Secretary Brown will leave.\"  The audience proved more receptive to the administration position than another gathering has 13 years before.  As applause drowned out the hoarse, profane shouts of protest, Graham Allison made his way up to the K-School forum's second tier and personally escorted the rabble rousers out of the building.</span></p> <p><span>Allison sticks to his guns.  \"Students, of all people, should be exposed to a broad range of perspectives.  Not to hear any counterarguments is wrong,\" he says.  \"But simply to distrup...you're within your rights to ask questions, even to have a short argument.  But you're not within your rights to shout and scream.\"</span></p> <p><span>Another incident involving Allison and \"the right to shout and scream\" took place year before the Brown incident.  The occasion was the dedication of the $11 million building for the K-School, and the plans for that day were grand.  But about 400 demonstrators chanted throughout Bok's address, protesting the naming of the school's library for Charles W. Engelhard--a magnate who earned much of his fortune in South African gold-mining.</span></p> <p><span>The days leading up to the dedication were filled with tense, round-the-clock negotiations between student groups demanding that one member of the organizing groups be allowed to speak at the ceremony, and several administrators, including Allison.</span></p> <p><span>In his address at the building's inauguration, Allison said at the beginning that a representative would only be allowed to speak if the protestors \"respected the dedication.\"  Drowning out the University's president with chants does not exactly coincide with Allison's idea of respect.  But the ceremony's featured speaker, Ted Kennedy, played politician and told the crowd of more than 5000 he and his family would assuredly stay to hear a spokesman chosen by the demonstrators, adding that he hoped the rest of the audience would remain as well.</span></p> <p><span>Spokesman Mark Smith '72-4 gave a rousing speech denouncing apartheid following the end of the ceremony.  It made the network news.  K-School officials reflected later that Allison and his fellow negotiators had been trapped by the Senator's politicking.</span></p> <p><span>But the Engelhard library issue did not filter away from the k-School as quickly as the throngs did.  Jackson estimates Allison spent more than 500 hours dealing with the controversy.  Schelling recalls the issue in vivid terms, saying, \"It was a terrible blow, a stunning shock to the whole school.  It was an exceptionally difficult political and diplomatic problem, on both sides.  He (Allison) was under enormous pressure from alumni threatening to withhold money, deans of other schools who saw it as an important precedent, and concerned faculty and students.\"</span></p> <p><span>By the time a committee had hammered out a solution in late May, the Engelhard issue had exhausted all concerned.  Allison and his team devised a classic compromise--the library would not be named after Engelhard but a commemorative plaque would be hung on a library wall.  Schelling says, \"We came out not unscarred but well and healthy.\"</span></p> <p><span>Allison comments ingenuously on his role in the conflicts that have dotted his career.  \"Sometimes maybe I've erred in failing to be sensitive enough to the concerns of some constituents who feel deeply about, and even offended by, the presentation of ideas.  There is danger in a University environment of being too cautions about confronting ideas.  My approach is not to shy away from ideas,\" he says.</span></p> <p><span>\"There's nothing chicken-hearted about Graham Allison,\" Jackson says, adding, \"He's a tenacious, dogged apostle of points of view, but is mature enought to modify or correct his point of view when opposing arguments prevail.\"  Schelling points out that the dean's position often shrouds his inner self.  \"A lot of people probably find him a little distant, harsh, overbearing, or thick-skinned.  To do his job he <i>has</i> to be--most of us are not good at giving people bad news, but as dean he is fully responsible for all the hard decisions,\" Schelling says, evoking questions about the island of Timor arrangement.</span></p> <p><span>The same way that Allison's personality seems a split between bureaucratic and entreprenurial prototypes, the K-School is undergoing a process of introspection and uncovering a dual strain:  training students to manage effectively and to think creatively.  But in summing up the K-School's goals, Allison cannot resist listing three major aims:  competence in public management, understanding of basic public policy issues, and encouraging people to \"think hard about the aims and limits of government.\"</span></p> <p><span>And in the same way that Allison has been freed of many of his taxing administrative chores with the arrival of Hale Champion, executive dean, he hopes that the K-School can free itself to address larger questions.  \"I think old-fashioned questions of political philosophy will become more wide-spread,\" he says.  If they do, Graham Allison will be right in the thick of the debate, whether at a Trilateral Commission tryst or a Council of foreign Relations meeting.  He will travel to keep in touch with what he terms the \"marketplace\"--he squeezes about six appointments a day into his weekly sojourns to Washington or New York--always on the ball, hustling, but never fully forgetting his role as a model for bureaucrats.</span></p>"}
{"title": "GSAS Enrollment Continues to Decline | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>There's a rumor going around the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences that only two department chairmen have responded to Dean Rosovsky's milestone report on the state and future of graduate education at the University.  Although the Dean issued the report about two years ago, this lack of Faculty feedback to Rosovsky's call for immediate community discussion isn't surprising.  Administrators and students at the GSAS feel certain that they are already grappling, if not successfully, with the issues Rosovsky raised in his report--the shrinking job market for academics, shrinking funds, and the shrinking school itself.</span></p> <p><span>Rosovsky, on the other hand, has dramatic plans for the institution that carries out the somewhat anachronistic task of training teachers and researchers for jobs that no longer exist.  His request for written comments by Faculty members on his several models for the GSAS of the future was supposed to precipitate the kind of discussion that led to Rosovsky's last success-the Core Curriculum.  In fact, from all reports, Rosovsky had pegged GSAS reform as his next pet project.</span></p> <p><span>Rosovsky waits, probably in vain, for widespread community exchange.

The Canadian program gives direct subsidies to thousands of low and middle income homeowners to help them slash their fuel bills.  The American program of tax incentives benefits only the rich.  To take a tax credit, you have to spend money first.  Of the less then 10 per cent of Americans who claimed tax credits for conservations purposes, more than 75 per cent were above the median national income, according to government statistics.  President Carter's proposal in his economic recovery program for $975 million to weatherize lower and middle income homes is the right step, but it is a drop in the bucket.  While the billions spent on synfuels and fusion are not benefitting anyone, a program of home insulation could provide direct and immediate relief for the poor.  Such a program would also create thousands of jobs in the faltering  home building and construction industries.<p>The government should split its strategy, giving insulation subsidies to the poor and increasing tax incentives for those above median income.  In addition, the Congress should act swiftly to adopt Senator Malcolm Wallop's (R-Wyo.) bill that would increase industrial tax credits for the installation of energy-efficient equipment from 10 to 30 per cent.  While they're at it, Congress should also pass the Building Energy Efficiency Performance Standards Act, shelved last year because of enforcement difficulties.  The bill would coordinate six federal agencies in the regulation of the building and housing industries.</p><p><b>C</b>ONSERVATION MAY make sense, but many people still consider it un-American--including the Republican Party.  Americans are used to spending and consuming, not tightening their belts, and Congress has balked at any attempts to place a tax on gasoline in order to reduce consumption.  Last spring Yergin proposed a gasoline tax that, no matter how politically impractical, is simpler and more effective than John Anderson's.  Yergin proposed a tax that would reach $1 a gallon in five years, with direct rebates to purchasers.  According to Yergin's statistics, that would reduce national gasoline consumption by 25 per cent.</p><p>Aside from conservation, the government should continue to explore alternative sources that don't pollute and won't provoke community opposition.  Some experts believe that hydroelectric power could, with significant technological advances, undergo a renaissance in the Northeast.  Solar energy is also in need of research funds.  Photovoltaics, the direct conversion of the sun's rays into electricity, is a promising but so far commercially unfeasible technology.  Current solar technologies are also valuable, but they require very specific types of construction and building materials.  With government tax incentives, however, a solar house does not have to cost any more than a non-solar one, and can save anywhere from 50 to 90 per cent on an average-sized home's energy consumption.</p><p>Solar energy, however, is still thought of as the energy source of visionaries and flakes.  While synfuels and fusion are celebrated, solar is scoffed at and insulation programs are considered as afterthoughts.  This winter there are millions of Americans who could benefit from national insulation and solar development programs.  Instead the only ones who will benefit from the national energy policy are the corporations and scientists in the fields of synfuel and fusion\n</p></t></span></p> <p>The government should split its strategy, giving insulation subsidies to the poor and increasing tax incentives for those above median income.

{"title": "Democracy in America | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>NEW YORK--Like a Pentagon flunky delivering the daily body count, Norma Lee stands amid the drifting clouds of hair spray, raising her voice a little so it will carry over the killer-bee whine of the foot-massaging machines.  \"Sunday--89 reporters groomed, 51 men and 38 women.  Monday--131 reporters groomed, more than half of them men.\"</span></p> <p><span>This, then, is the scene outside the Democratic convention--an endless cavalcade of politicking, oratory and hair care.  The networks can show you quite a bit but they haven't taken their cameras to the eighth floor of the Statler Hilton, home of the Bristol Myers-Clairol Press Fresh-Up Lounge.</span></p> <p><span>The idea that became the Fresh-Up Lounge first visited Lee a few months before the 1968 Democratic convention.  \"Back then, it was for women only.  I thought to myself, \"men have their bars, so women need some place to go and relax,' \" she explains.  \"A different company, that's all I say,\" sponsored her effort in Chicago, at a time when grooming meant something political.  \"But now, men are just as involved in fashion as women,\" she says, directing yet another reporter, clutching a complimentary can of Miller, into the bedroom/salon.</span></p> <p><span>\"It's so nice to see men finally beginning to take care of their hair,\" Mary Crosby, chief of the eight-man styling team, said as she worked on one midwestern reporter.  \"I hate messy hair, I just hate it,\" Crosby added, pointing to the pink-caped men hunkered down in front of lighted mirrors as proof of their emancipation from old-fashioned prejudices against $30 haircuts.</span></p> <p><span>But there are still a few shreds of the masculinity left.  \"Get that camera out of here, one newspaper man shouted when another reporter produced a Nikon.  \"My friends back home, not to mention my editor, would solder me if they knew I was here.\"  And so the photographer left, but not before picking up a \"Hospitality Bag\" filled with free samples of products from hairspray to No-Doz.  In the corner, Norma Lee is explaining one more time that business, or hospitality, is booming.  \"So far today, we've had over 100, more than half of them men...\"</span></p> <p><span>All the TV cameras came to the convention rally of the campus democrats of America, but they didn't stay long--in fact, two-thirds of the audience left as soon as the organizers announced that \"featured guest\" Chip Carter was too busy lobbying for the MX missile to show up.</span></p> <p><span>The Campus Democrats of America is the \"official student wing of the Democratic party.\"  Its press kit teatures  a one-paragraph clipping from page 51 of <i>The New York Times</i> of June 3, 1979, the early date at which the CDA decided to endorse President Carter for re-election.  There is also a letter with the salutation \"Dear fellow Democrats,\" which points out that one of the organization's seven goals is to \"create a win psychology.\"  A memo paid for by the Democratic National Committee mentions proudly that when President Carter called for draft registration, \"the CDA immediately saw the propriety of the president's stance and voiced its support for registration.\"  The newsletter adds that \"the culmination of CDA's work occurred when CDA president Bernie Friedman was selected to be the youth representative at the White House signing of the registration proclamation.  In recognition of his outstanding work, he received a personal greeting and a thank you from the president.\"</span></p> <p><span>During the series of addresses that opened the CDA rally, the following information was gleaned:</span></p> <p><span>\"1980 is the beginning of a new decade.\" <b><i>--President Friedman</i></b></span></p> <p><span>\"I'll be going back to school in a few weeks.\" \u00a0\u00a0<b><i>--Charles Leznick, head of Yale students for Carter</i></b></span></p> <p><span>\"Many students today are into serious capitalism, and that is a good thing.\" \u00a0\u00a0<b><i>--Charles Mannet, chairman of the Democratic National Committee finance council</i></b></span></p> <p><span>\"Young people are not millionaires.\" \u00a0\u00a0<b><i>--Christ Gershon, political director of operating engineers international union</i></b></span></p> <p><span>\"I can't believe we sat through this and Chip Carter isn't going to come.\" \u00a0\u00a0<b><i>--An NBC reporter</i></b></span></p> <p><span>There are other facets of the conventions the TV cameras ignore--the railroad press lounge in the Garden basement, for example, where employees of the railway lobby distribute free beer, sandwiches, and advice about the need for more government subsidies to the rail industry.  But the biggest distortion of the TV broadcasts is their ability to add excitement where it doesn't exist, and paradoxically, to miss the spirit during the few moments of true emotion.</span></p> <p><span>For the most part, the convention floor is full-people sit in their flag-red folding chairs and chat, sleep, or read <i>The Times.</i>  But the network crews, self-contained TV stations complete with backpack transmitters, constantly criss-cross the floor in search of some small scandal.  When one stops, the others gather.  Like blood beginning to clot, the aisle where Garrick Utley halts suddenly attracts Lesly Stahl, Sam Donaldson, and their assorted assistants.  Tuesday afternoon, while most of the delegates stared unseeingly at the podium or talked with someone in an adjacent delegation, Sander Vanocur decided that the Massachusetts delegation needed visiting.  Pretty soon, the Bay State section was full of more electronics and lights than Xenon's, the boisterous disco that last night hosted the Carter victory party.  \"It's all because of the blue phone and the red phone,\" a delegation aide explained enthusiastically.  \"The blue phone goes to the Kennedy trailer; the red one to the podium.  To have them both in the same place--it's a very rare combination.</span></p> <p><span>There are occasionally novelties to divert the delegates.  During the debate on federally-funded abortions, a few delegates grew tired of waving their \"Vote Life\" signs and decided to unfurl a 20-foot banner with a picture of a fetus and the legend \"abortion is murder.\"  The \"pro-choice\" campaigners in the area decided they didn't \"have to stand still for that kind of shit,\" as one explained.  So they jumped in front of the baby poster, blocking the view with their banners, which featured a picture of the Statue of Liberty.  The battle continued for the entire 20 minutes the abortion vote took; finally, inevitably, the dead baby backers began to push and shove, and pretty soon pro-choice and pro-life were hammering away at each other.  Each side accused the other of fascism; there was a good deal of loose talk about genocide and matrocide and Christianity.  And when it was all over, pro-choice backers got to crow, when their side won the vote by a comfortable margin.  More than likely, the sign would not have made much of a difference, but it's the thought that counts.</span></p> <p><span>In short, the floor of the convention is not the hot spot one might expect.  \"I came here thinking I would be awed,\" Mary Ellen Preusser, a former Cambridge City Councilor and a Kennedy alternate, said as she watched the debate.  \"But so much of it is dull,\" she added, comparing the scene to the Cambridge City Council with an extra 3200 councilors.  One reason for the boredom is that in most cases delegates don't even vote; unless they want to deviate from the Kennedy or Carter line, the delegation whip for each candidate simply casts their vote for them.  \"If the Carter person says 'Tom O'Neill can't vote, he's across the hall talking to someone,' then the Kennedy leader says, 'Sure, and how about Governor King?'\"  Massachusetts delegation aide Greg Jarboe explains.  \"They always manage to work it out,\" he adds, flashing the type of grin that marks people who like the game of politics very, very much.</span></p> <p><span>But if TV exaggerates the excitement of some incidents, it also drains the emotion from the few hours in each gathering that are truly spirited.  Ted Kennedy's supporters came to New York fueled by a deeper passion than the Carter backers; in the last few months, theirs had become a campaign of sad nobility disguised as issues.</span></p> <p><span>The shouting begins when Joan Kennedy enters the hall; it is clear that the Kennedy forces want some preaching tonight.  They are in no mood for deals--when Carter transportation secretary Neal Goldsmith announces that \"compromise unity language is circulating on the floor,\" they boo.  When Carter consumer affair representative Esther Peterson ends her defense of the Georgia presidency by yelling \"Four more years,\" there are enough jeers to positively melt the heart of Rep. John B. Anderson (R-Ill.).  And so, by the time Rep. Barbara McClusky (D-Md.) introduces Kennedy, they are ready.  The orchestra plays \"Macnamara's Band,\" the blue-and-white placards begin to wave, and the \"magnificent example of grace, courage and valor\" strides out on stage.</span></p> <p><span>From the day the campaign began, Kennedy speeches featured miscues and bumbled phrases.  To a Black audience he once decided to mimic Rep.  Walter Fauntroy (D-D.C.) and came off sounding like Steppin' Fetchit.  At a girls' school in New Hampshire he led a confused audience in singing an off-key \"Happy Birthday\" to himself.  Wherever he went, the answers to questions were filled with umms, ahs, and the sentences strung themselves out in endless, knotted ropes of words.  But Tuesday night, once he had lost, once he had fumbled a lead that once seemed as solid as any in politics could be, Kennedy was ready to orate, to stretch his Boston accent and jut his jaw and preach the Good Word.</span></p> <p><span>His speech, which the media powers that be quickly filed away under classic, drew on the fathers of Democratic liberalism--Ronald Reagan \"has no right to quote the words of Franklin Delano Roosevelt,\" Kennedy said to the biggest cheers of his address.  Offering a \"New Hope\" where his brother had offered a \"New Frontier,\" Kennedy moved beyond his standard economic line to evoke the image not only of a generation mired in economic misery, but also a \"generation unsurpassed in its potential.\"</span></p> <p><span>He would have been met with cheers had he read from the sports page of the Daily News, but Kennedy added to his welcome with the force of his speech.  The delegates paid him tribute when, for the first time all week, they sat still and listened.  And when he was done, they paid him tribute again with a demonstration that lasted 35 minutes.  From the bottom of Madison Square Garden, the center court at a Knicks game to the cheap seats around the top, the blue-and-white signs flapped up and down, the delegates shouting \"We want Ted.\"  On the floor, the standard-bearers from \"Kennedy corner,\" home of the Massachusetts, New Jersey and California entourages, began a slow march around the floor, carrying their signs, slapping hands, hugging as they went.</span></p> <p><span>Carter patrons filled much of the spectators' gallery; they sat quietly, immobile as the demonstration surged.  \"Fucking Harvard snobs,\" one murmured.  On the floor, a few southern delegates began a \"Jim--Eeee Carter\" chant, but before long it disappeared into the chorus of \"We want Ted.\"  Where television had benefited from its narrow, tight focus before, it now suffered; the power of the Kennedy backers was the most impressive on a grand scale.  The only person in the hall able even to dampen the spirits of the demonstrators was the orchestra vocalist, a bald, leather-jacketed hybrid of Johnny Rotten and Guy Lombardo who forgot the words to \"If I Had a Hammer,\" an error that by all accounts was quite welcome.  In the end, it was almost anti-climactic that Kennedy won his platform battle; his real fight, with the party, with the bitterness of a year-long campaign that led nowhere slowly, was won in the tide of cheers that refused to die.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Waiting for Lefty | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b><i>The news of the death of the liberal left has been greatly exaggerated.</i></b> <b><i>--Michael Harrington</i></b></span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE LEFT WING of the Democratic Party is not yet pushing up the daisies.  It is far, however, from healthy.  And the election campaign this fall will probably worsen the illness and make the symptoms more obvious.</span></p> <p><span>Last Tuesday morning, as the Democratic Party proper began its platform debate, part of its shrinking left edge rallied under the name \"Democratic Agenda\" at an aging theater on West 43rd St. Harrington, chairman of the Democratic Socialist organizing committee, called Democratic Agenda a \"coalition that uniquely brings together all the progressive constituencies around the idea that we cannot solve any of our problems without full employment.\"  If Democratic Agenda truly represents \"all progressive constituencies\" the the left is seriously arthritic.  Almost every spokesman at the rally was a veteran, most well past the zenith of their influence.  Gloria Steinem called for ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment.  Cesar Chavez wants a boycott of Maggio brand carrots.  And United Auto Workers president Douglas Fraser said his constituency was interested in a single issue--more jobs.</span></p> <p><span>Even the method for obtaining full employment divides the group.  To Fraser and many of his labor colleagues, it is a matter of maintaining and expanding old programs--\"the platform we adopted in '76 was pretty good, and it just hasn't been used yet,\" Fraser said.  To Harrington and the 38 socialist delegtes at the convention who caucused Wednesday, the party must \"go as far beyond FDR as he went beyond Hoover, to a new a much more radical liberalism.\"</span></p> <p><span>But Harrington, and even Fraser, spent their energies in a defensive battle, struggling to keep the majority party from drifting to the right.  They even lost that battle, at least in some ways.  Jimmy Carter is the first Democratic president since the New Deal to worry as much about inflation as unemployment, purposefully reducing job opportunities in an effort to hold down rising prices.  He not only is the first to advocate such a plan, he was also the first to get away with it.  Ted Kennedy and the liberals won their floor fight, swinging the convention behind a $12 million jobs program.  But they lost where it counted; even while delegates were shouting \"JOBS, JOBS, JOBS,\" Carter was telling his aides that he could never endorse such a program.  Too inflationary, explained Carter, who later in the day would send a letter to the convention defending the $60 million M-X missile.</span></p> <p><span>Though the failings are many, the paramount problem facing Democratic liberals is their inability to convince large numbers of Americans to support large-scale social spending.  The glamor programs of the '60s are now abused as giveaways; where once Americans applauded the war on poverty, they now save their praise, and their votes, for those who pledge to ferret out welfare cheats.  \"We must talk about the people that it is no longer popular to talk about,\" Representative Ronald Dellums (D-Cal.) told the convention Wednesday night.  Liberals, he added, just \"win back the party and win back America.\"</span></p> <p><span>Harrington's career provides a good benchmark for charting the rise of disinterest.  When he wrote <i>The Other America</i> in the early '60s, almost everyone, including congress, listened.  <i>Decade of Decision,</i> issued earlier this year and just as full of the hope and despair of American life as his earlier work, already carpets remainder tables coast to coast.</span></p> <p><span>American politics, much more than in countries with parliamentary system, demands visible leaders.  One name begins and ends the list of national liberal spokesmen--Senator Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass).  His strengths and weaknesses explain much about the rise, continuing fall, and potential resurgence of the Democratic left wing.</span></p> <p><span>Kennedy captivated the convention hall audience Tuesday night and he captured the hearts and cameras of the media.  But he was speaking to people who remembered his brothers, who understood his place in the context of history and of American liberalism, who had watched his humiliating campaign.  On the stump, however, Kennedy was perceived not only as irresponsible--the tarnish of Chappaquiddick seems resistant to the polish of time and resilient to the force of reason--but also personally weak.  In short, though the polls show many Democrats agree with him, he was unable to best a spectacularly unsuccessful president.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HERE ARE OTHER colorful leaders on the left.  They confine their efforts, however, to <i>a</i> cause, not <i>the</i> cause.  Steinem talks ERA, Chavez talks carrots.  Consequently, parts of the liberal philosophy may do very well indeed--witness, for example, the increased attention recently paid gay rights--while the liberal movement as a unified whole, remains an academic proposition.</span></p> <p><span>Beyond that lack of leaders, and the divisions that emerge from single-issue politics, there are other frailties.  In the '60s, the left was hyper-organized, able to turn out massive amounts of money and support.  But as the reformers of that decade opted out of the system, the networks began to collapse.  Simultaneously, the right began to learn its lesson.  A man named Richard Vigurie looked fondly at the power of the Sierra Club or the anti-war groups to mobilize support, and decided to go them one better.  His computer bank now contains more than 20 million names, most of them eager to give cash to anyone or anything that will help uphold decency, religion and high profits.  The anti-feminists, formerly too demure to march and lobby, now scream shrilly about co-ed bathrooms; the pro-life contingent bombs clinics and pesters legislators.  Liberals seem to be slowly emerging from the alfalfa-sprout doldrums of the decade past--a Vigurie-style operation was set up this year by some old '60s radicals--but they have a ways to go before the marchers on Washington and the floods of postcards resume.</span></p> <p><span>In their current disarray, the liberal wing of the party, most notably minority and urban Democrats, face an election that could shred whatever solidarity remains.  There are three possibilities for the left--it can go for John B. Anderson (R-Ill.), it can split into innumerable blocs, backing the hopeless candidacies of Barry Commoner or socialist David McReynolds or communist veteran Gus Hall, or it can somehow manage to fall in line behind Carter.</span></p> <p><span>The Anderson alternative--already embraced by Stewart Mott and others of the monied left--is a possibility.  Though Anderson enthusiasts were having a hard time finding much support on the convention floor, their man stands to profit from every barrage Carter and Reagan level at each other.  Many Americans will perceive Anderson as a moderate, and many on the left will examine his campaign closely and find much to cheer, both in style and substance.  Anderson's vice-presidential choice, and even more importantly, his standing in the polls as election day approaches will determine how much support he gets from the Democratic left.  Should he be close going into election day he may inherit the support of some disgruntled Kennedy backers.  More likely, he will fade as liberals decide he is an ersatz lefty, with a record that makes Carter look like a member of the Politburo.</span></p> <p><span>Fringe party candidates always get about the same minuscule percentage of the vote; only a few opt to salve their consciences by supporting the dogma-ridden, the-revolution-is-coming corners of American politics.  But this year, the candidacy of Commoner and his Citizens Party running mate LaDonna Harris, may pick up one or two per cent of the vote.  Commoner is well-known to liberals, and by all accounts well-loved, the evangelical scientist, who appeals mostly to academics and environmentalists.  If enough leftists, especially on campuses, vote for him, they could tip the balance in one or two states.</span></p> <p><span>The third option--uniting behind Jimmy Carter--will take more than the endorsement delivered by Ted Kennedy via Tip O'Neill earlier this week.  Left Democrats, as noted, are concerned about causes--the woman's movement will realize that Carter spurned their ERA and abortion platform planks, some Blacks walked out last night because he wouldn't even meet with them, and labor may recognize that \"hundreds of thousands of jobs\" promised by Carter is not quite the same as the $12 billion employment program he repudiated.  Four years ago, Carter was an untested commodity--liberals voted for him with hope.  If they vote for him this time, it will be with a sense of resignation, knowing that they merely cast anti-Reagan ballots.  And in supporting Carter, the left will submerge itself once again, proving to future candidates that they need not worry about the liberal vote as long as there is an impotent loser trying to prove his virility by leading the Republican ticket.  And there always is.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE UNATTRACTIVENESS of all three options leads to a final possibility--liberals might just stay home.  Actually, the Democratic left will never fail to vote in large numbers.  It makes them feel guilty and cheats them of the righteous pleasure of complaining during the subsequent four years.  But they may very well stay away from the storefronts where the Carter campaign will desperately need volunteers.  Thanks to new campaign financing laws, their money is not in great demand, but the endless effort of suburban housewives, the station wagons to get people to the polls, the send-me-anywhere usefulness of college activists is essential.</span></p> <p><span>Should the left--primarily Blacks, students and feminists--stay home, it will send a message that it cannot be counted on to always back the lesser of three evils.  It will also hand the election to Ronald Wilson Reagan, the bogey-man in the closet whose image every speaker this week has summoned in an effort to keep the troops in line.  There are those who say a Reagan presidency would be the best thing that could happen to the left--four years of fascism, they reason, might turn Americans into leftists again.  The people who talk like this most often live in Shaker Heights and practice corporate law during the day; if Ronald Reagan wins his battle, Common Cause may thrive, but Americans on the edge of poverty will suffer horribly.</span></p> <p><span>So the short-term future is bleak; if the liberals sacrifice principle, they remain powerless.  If they stand on principle, they fall on it as well, for Reagan will do his best, which may be pretty good, to dismantle every useful piece of government legislation ever passed.  Over the longer haul, there may be slightly more promise for the liberal wing.  Should Reagan win, liberals will consolidate; should Carter win, he must pass the presidency on in four years.  It seems unlikely liberals will accept Walter Mondale as his successor, tainted as he is by his vigorous pimping for the president and his bitter attack on Kennedy in recent months.  But there are other, new leaders that may be emerging Dellums turned on a lukewarm crowd with his mix of preaching and urban populism.  Senator Bill Bradley (D-N.J.), Senator Paul Tsongas (D-Mass), State Sen. Julian bond of Georgia and Gov. Jerry Brown of California are all young, all liberals within the party mainstream, and all rising stars.</span></p> <p><span>But the main man for the liberal faction remains Ted Kennedy.  Already his people are suggesting that the Bay State Senator may have \"undone Chappaquiddick\" with his fiery speech Tuesday night.  Probably not, but he did set lie to the notion that he cannot lead.  More importantly, he managed to unite the entire left--from Harrington to Dellums, to Fraser--behind him with his appeal to the issues, a unity demonstrated the next night when nearly every delegate pledged to Kennedy voted for him despite his withdrawal from the race.  As he was finishing his speech, one delegate unfurled a banner reading \"Kennedy in '84\"; tactically, his decision to stay with the party at least guarantees him a good shot next time.  Should the force of one speech be enough to cement together an aging, divided coalition through a campaign that promises only dilemmas and four years that will be bitter at best, Kennedy may yet have his day in the sun.  He had better, for without him the liberal left will remain in the shadows.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Don't Touch That Story--It's Unpatriotic | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>S</b>UPPOSE THERE ARE two academic centers of power vying for intellectual hegemony--call them Harvard and Yale.  Harvard, long dominant in struggles for primacy, has grown complacent.  Yale, meanwhile, has devised a cunning plot designed to wreak havoc at Harvard and pave the way for its own ultimate victory in the cold war of academia.</span></p> <p><span>The scheme takes root innocuously enough, unnoticed by the high-minded Harvard decision-makers.  When a young reporter stumbles upon the plot--known menacingly as Plan Core--and insists on pursuing the subject, he falls out of favor with his paper.  But as the enterprising reporter digs deeper into the story, he comes to realize the ugly, brutal truth, horrifying through it may seem.  Could it be that Dean Rosovsky is unwittingly a Yale spy?</span></p> <p><span><i>The Spike</i> takes this idea, adds best-seller ingredients, and transposes it to a more timely bipolar conflict--that of the United States and the Soviet Union.  The latest ads for <i>The Spike</i> goad the public into paying 13 bucks to read what the \"liberal journalist establishment\" has almost universally panned.  See what those sullied liberal press types are scared of, the ad continues.  After all, chances are that those who reviewed the book in the liberal publications are <i>tyomhaya verboura:</i></span></p> <p><span>...an unconscious source....  This type of person serves Soviet interests and works under KGB control without realizing what he is doing.  Lenin used to call such people useful idiots.  Without being conscious KGB agents, they are often in a position to accomplish far more for the Soviet Union than the people who are knowingly working for us.</span></p> <p><span>Of course, those reviewers and columnists may be principal agents--<i>osnovny</i>--or merely trusted persons--<i>doveryonnoe listo.</i>  In either case, with their help, the help of the American liberal establishment and of frivolous laws like those which limit CIA powers, the Russkies are on their way to world domination.</span></p> <p><span>Or so Arnaud de Borchgrave and Robert Moss, impeccable journalists and fledgling novelists, would have us believe.  Their paranoid world-view is peculiar; it suggests that the Soviet Union could, by sowing the seeds of \"disinformation\" in the American press, influence public opinion so that it could achieve world hegemony without so much as aiming a nuclear weapon at New York.  By simply urging Western journalists to follow their own instincts--by encouraging them to expose covert CIA activities, for example--the Soviets can immeasurably further their interests, and drive Western Europe out of the U.S. sphere of influence into their grimy hands.</span></p> <p><span>But that is just one facet of The Plan--Plan Azev to be precise--that threatens to sap America's international influence.  This KGB grand design includes infiltrating Western governments with moles--double agents--who do things like conveying classified documents through microdots on the back of chewing gum wrappers sent in packages to orphans in East Germany.  No kidding.</span></p> <p><span>Robert Hockney, hotshot editor of the <i>Berkeley Barb</i> during the student uprisings of the late'60s, prize-winning Vietnam reporter and the first journalist to rip the veil off the CIA, and (naturally) handsome stud, wends his way from New York to Paris to Humburg to London and then back to Washington in search of the elusive \"truth.\"  As the authors tiresomely tell us, he faces a most disquieting question:  Were all his earlier journalistic <i>tours de force</i> fed to him indirectly by the Russkies?  Was his CIA expose planted by Soviet spies?  Was his much-heralded interview with a North Vietnamese guerilla leader a set-up?  Has he been an instrument of Soviet perfidy?</span></p> <p><span>De Borchgrave is regarded in media circles as somewhat of a prince, <i>Newsweek's</i> chief foreign correspondent who regularly conducts penetrating interview with world leaders, often ferreting out slivers of information no one else gets.  Moss edits <i>Foreign Report,</i> a trenchant publication associated with London's conservative <i>Economist.</i>  He has written two other books that received positive reviews, but this is the first attempt at fiction for the reporters.  It shows--their writing undermines their well-conceived plot.  Too often their characters approach cliche, the writing is choppy, and when they reach for poetry, they come up with doggerel.  They're at their worst when they describe the women characters in the story-all stereotypes.  There is Tessa Torrance, national sex symbol turned terrorist sympathizer; Julie Cummings, the young woman on the move who takes Capitol Hill by storm; Nguyen Canh Lani, the NLF supporter devoted more to her cause than her men; and Astrid Renard, the voracious nymphomaniac.  They all enjoy sex.  They are all beautiful.  Clearly, this bipolar world is a man's world.</span></p> <p><span>Not-surprisingly, the journalists are at their best when depicting characters based on authentic figures.  Their portrayal of President Billy Connor from Flats, Mississippi, his ignoramus friend named Timmy, and the \"Mississippi Mafia\" borders on the hilarious and hits awfully close to home.  Or there's Sen.  Seamus O'Reilly, a not-too-subtle Moynihan clone who seems to represent the authors' fondest hopes in this world gone awry.  But the protagonist, Hockney, is not exactly believable.  He decides at graduation that he wants to do investigative work, and with a minimum of effort becomes a renowned journalist.

The two celebrated writers who wrote the book have a straightforward answer:  Objectivity doesn't exist.

{"title": "King Of the K-School | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>It is a dog day of Cambridge's sweltering summer, the day after Teddy Kennedy with-drew from the presidential sweepstakes.  But the pleasantly air-conditioned Kenned School of Government is abuzz with activity as on most other days, figures rushing through snakelike corridors, stopping briefly to salute one another, filling the Forum with its recognizable murmur.  To a detached observer, these people exude a slightly self-important air--but they also give the impression that they have places to <i>go.</i></span></p> <p><span>Four years ago, Graham T. Allison Jr. '62, dean of the Kennedy School, thought he too had a place to go:  Washington.  But, he explains now, President Bok's persuasion prevailed over other forces, and he turned down a post in the Carter administration to take the helm of the Kennedy School.  Since then, he has presided over a period of vigorous expansion and sometimes vigorous controversy at the school that some have labeled the pet project of Bok's presidency.</span></p> <p><span>As the K-School grows, Allison necessarily has lost the ability to remain in close touch with everyone who walks through the polished glass doors on Boylston Street, something he seemed able to do in the program's more intimate days.  Somewhere along the line, he has acquired a reputation among some as a distant but diligent manager.  The K-School has come quite a ways since the summer of 1969, when a small group of \"concerned faculty\" patiently ironed out the details of a proposal for a public policy program.  In that relatively short (in terms of Harvard) timespan, Allison too has come a long way--maybe too long.  \"Graham Allison?\"  one K-School source asks rhetorically.  \"He's the consummate bureaucrat.\"</span></p> <p><span>At first blush, the image seems hard to erase.  Allison apologizes excessively for being 20 minutes late for an appointment.  He speaks in steady, measured tones--in a sonorous voice oddly reminiscent of Dan Rather--weighing each word heavily.  He likes to order things in sets of three.  He uses words like \"prioritize\" and mouths sentences like, \"There's no model--so we're trying to define operationally a strategy for achieving that objective.\"</span></p> <p><span>His coffee table is stacked with books, his desk is cluttered with papers.  You can almost picture Allison slaving away efficiently in a dimly-lit office 90 hours a week, deriving enjoyment from pushing papers and organizing files.  There is a touch of the politician in him, as he smoothly introduces strangers and smiles expansively.  But when he says he admires \"those who run for elective positions, who are out there slugging it out, putting their own skin on the line,\" the implication is unmistakeable: Graham Allison would never be one of them.</span></p> <p><span>Last week, Allison embarked for the Soviet Union.  He had been invited by Russian officials.  In the wake of the Olympic boycott and the cooling of the cold war, however, Allison was not about to be injudicious; he called up the State Department to see if his trip was appropriate.</span></p> <p><span>Among K-School administrators, his managerial prowess is almost revered.  As Thomas Schelling, professor of Public Policy and a friend of Allison's, says, \"He's always working on the hard immediate problems.  He spends an awful lot of time doing things most of us wouldn't like to do.\"  Others, like Ira A. Jackson '71, assistant dean of the Kennedy School, bring up his tenacious application to fundraising--one of the less appealing responsibilities of a dean--during the school's high growth stage.  And since he assumed the K-School's leadership, he has plunged himself into the sea of administrative nitty gritty that has steadily deepened as programs have mushroomed.</span></p> <p><span>Even the system of governance he has constructed as dean resembles a paragon of bureaucracy.  \"The school is ruled like the island of Timor,\" Allison says.  \"Everyone sits around a big fire.  Up comes an issue.  Those most interested in that issue gather in the center of the circle.  Those in the inner circle study the matter, and bring it back to the outer circle for approval.\"  He compares faculty members to \"partners in a law firm.\"</span></p> <p><span>Allison concedes that this mechanism, aimed at decentralizing the decision-making process, will prove harder to sustain as the faculty grows larger.  In many ways, then, the signals he emits are those of the prototypical bureaucrat, a functional organizer and manager extraordinaire.</span></p> <p><span>But a current of tension runs through Graham Allison's gut, a tension paralleled in the graduate school he heads.  While Jackson describes him as \"self-effacing\" and \"remarkably unpretentious,\" he also terms him \"a bull, a tiger, a hustler, a zealot, an entreprenurial guy, an unmodified enthusiast, and a genuine one.\"  Despite his carefully controlled veneer when discussing matters important to him, Allison is \"in a fundamental way, a regular guy,\" according to Jackson.  And his style has never been to shun controversy.  In fact, he often seems to attract it, at times betraying more than a trace of bluster.  If Allison displays many characteristics associated with the \"consummate bureaucrat,\" he also has a streak of maverick individualism, sometimes, he concedes, to a fault.</span></p> <p><span>One colleague recounts a dinner party Allison attended last spring.  \"At base, Graham is a man of passion.  I asked him about the campaign.  But he had been introduced to a zoologist, and they immediately launched into an animated discussion about racoons, a few of which apparently frequent the Allison's backyard.  They talked for an hour about <i>racoons.</i>  Once he got going on a subject he clearly enjoyed, he could not be disengaged.\"</span></p> <p><span>Don K. Price, Weatherhead Professor of Government and Allison's predecessor as dean of the Kennedy School, has nothing but praise for his successor, noting in particular his fundraising skills.  He, too, detects the duality Allison's personality, an easygoing manner combined with extraordinary intentness.  \"I know Graham as an occasional fishing companion.  He's a very good, very ardent fisherman who will go with you at the drop of a hat.  He's great fun to be with, whether watching a tennis game or collaborating on a project,\" he says.</span></p> <p><span>Ardor is a trait that has revealed itself since his days as an undergraduate.  After two years spent as a Marshall scholar at Hertford College, he returned to Harvard and became an official at the fledgling Institute of Politics while working on his Ph.D. thesis, eventually published as <i>The Essence of Decision.</i>  In 1966, he acted as a decoy when Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara, the first IOP \"honorary associate,\" was beseiged by 700 angry anti-war demonstrators--the first indication that the war would not let the University rest in peace.</span></p> <p><span>In an effort to sneak McNamara past the crowd, institute officials had Allison sit in a car at the Quincy House Master's garage on DeWolfe St.  It took a couple hundred of the eager demonstrators some time before they realized the car's occupant was not defense secretary Robert McNamara, but loyal Institute official Graham Allison.</span></p> <p><span>Last October, another Secretary of Defense visited Harvard to deliver a dull address on the merits of SALT II to a more sedate group of observers.  Harold Brown had finished reciting four of his list of six reasons why SALT II was a \"significant step\" towards controlling the arms race when two surly members of the Revolutionary Communist Party interrupted his speech with a stream of obscenities.</span></p> <p><span>While Brown stepped down from the podium, his face exhibiting no emotion, Allison took a microphone beside the stage.  His voice fraught with barely restrained fury, he warned, \"If you don't shut up right now, Secretary Brown will leave.\"  The audience proved more receptive to the administration position than another gathering has 13 years before.  As applause drowned out the hoarse, profane shouts of protest, Graham Allison made his way up to the K-School forum's second tier and personally escorted the rabble rousers out of the building.</span></p> <p><span>Allison sticks to his guns.  \"Students, of all people, should be exposed to a broad range of perspectives.  Not to hear any counterarguments is wrong,\" he says.  \"But simply to distrup...you're within your rights to ask questions, even to have a short argument.  But you're not within your rights to shout and scream.\"</span></p> <p><span>Another incident involving Allison and \"the right to shout and scream\" took place year before the Brown incident.  The occasion was the dedication of the $11 million building for the K-School, and the plans for that day were grand.  But about 400 demonstrators chanted throughout Bok's address, protesting the naming of the school's library for Charles W. Engelhard--a magnate who earned much of his fortune in South African gold-mining.</span></p> <p><span>The days leading up to the dedication were filled with tense, round-the-clock negotiations between student groups demanding that one member of the organizing groups be allowed to speak at the ceremony, and several administrators, including Allison.</span></p> <p><span>In his address at the building's inauguration, Allison said at the beginning that a representative would only be allowed to speak if the protestors \"respected the dedication.\"  Drowning out the University's president with chants does not exactly coincide with Allison's idea of respect.  But the ceremony's featured speaker, Ted Kennedy, played politician and told the crowd of more than 5000 he and his family would assuredly stay to hear a spokesman chosen by the demonstrators, adding that he hoped the rest of the audience would remain as well.</span></p> <p><span>Spokesman Mark Smith '72-4 gave a rousing speech denouncing apartheid following the end of the ceremony.  It made the network news.  K-School officials reflected later that Allison and his fellow negotiators had been trapped by the Senator's politicking.</span></p> <p><span>But the Engelhard library issue did not filter away from the k-School as quickly as the throngs did.  Jackson estimates Allison spent more than 500 hours dealing with the controversy.  Schelling recalls the issue in vivid terms, saying, \"It was a terrible blow, a stunning shock to the whole school.  It was an exceptionally difficult political and diplomatic problem, on both sides.  He (Allison) was under enormous pressure from alumni threatening to withhold money, deans of other schools who saw it as an important precedent, and concerned faculty and students.\"</span></p> <p><span>By the time a committee had hammered out a solution in late May, the Engelhard issue had exhausted all concerned.  Allison and his team devised a classic compromise--the library would not be named after Engelhard but a commemorative plaque would be hung on a library wall.  Schelling says, \"We came out not unscarred but well and healthy.\"</span></p> <p><span>Allison comments ingenuously on his role in the conflicts that have dotted his career.  \"Sometimes maybe I've erred in failing to be sensitive enough to the concerns of some constituents who feel deeply about, and even offended by, the presentation of ideas.  There is danger in a University environment of being too cautions about confronting ideas.  My approach is not to shy away from ideas,\" he says.</span></p> <p><span>\"There's nothing chicken-hearted about Graham Allison,\" Jackson says, adding, \"He's a tenacious, dogged apostle of points of view, but is mature enought to modify or correct his point of view when opposing arguments prevail.\"  Schelling points out that the dean's position often shrouds his inner self.  \"A lot of people probably find him a little distant, harsh, overbearing, or thick-skinned.  To do his job he <i>has</i> to be--most of us are not good at giving people bad news, but as dean he is fully responsible for all the hard decisions,\" Schelling says, evoking questions about the island of Timor arrangement.</span></p> <p><span>The same way that Allison's personality seems a split between bureaucratic and entreprenurial prototypes, the K-School is undergoing a process of introspection and uncovering a dual strain:  training students to manage effectively and to think creatively.  But in summing up the K-School's goals, Allison cannot resist listing three major aims:  competence in public management, understanding of basic public policy issues, and encouraging people to \"think hard about the aims and limits of government.\"</span></p> <p><span>And in the same way that Allison has been freed of many of his taxing administrative chores with the arrival of Hale Champion, executive dean, he hopes that the K-School can free itself to address larger questions.  \"I think old-fashioned questions of political philosophy will become more wide-spread,\" he says.  If they do, Graham Allison will be right in the thick of the debate, whether at a Trilateral Commission tryst or a Council of foreign Relations meeting.  He will travel to keep in touch with what he terms the \"marketplace\"--he squeezes about six appointments a day into his weekly sojourns to Washington or New York--always on the ball, hustling, but never fully forgetting his role as a model for bureaucrats.</span></p>"}

{"title": "A Glass Half Empty | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>J</b>IMMY CARTER'S presidency has enshrined a law of contemporary politics that seemingly governs those who govern:  For every vision, there is an equal and opposite revision.  Not that he bears sole responsibility--he is at once a product and an extension of the politics fashioned by the media and the polls.  He cannot automatically be condemned for conducting his presidency like a campaign and his campaign like a president.  More dangerous are the roots of his present posture, a stance much different from that of four years ago, when he rode a wave of superficial optimism into office.  Carter is practicing the politics of pessimism, needlessly, and his very negativism may sweep him out of the White House--his crisis of confidence supplanted by Ronald Reagan's crisis of overconfidence.</span></p> <p><span>Four years ago, Carter thought it appropriate to ask America two questions in his paperback.  \"Why Not the Best?\":</span></p> <p><span>Can our government be honest, decent, open, fair and compassionate?  Can our government be competent?</span></p> <p><span>Sadly, \"Why Not The Best?\"  has not proved to be a rhetorical question over the last four years.  But it would be too easy for a pundit to point cynically at Bert Lance as an example of \"honesty\", Billy Carter as \"decent\", Presidential Directive #59 as \"open\", the president's unwillingness to debate as \"fair\", the induced recession to combat inflation as \"compassionate\", and Carter's overall record as \"competent\".</span></p> <p><span>Carter's blatant politicking while in office has sown the seeds of paranoia, a tension of the type he claimed he would dispel.  Who knows what U.S. foreign policy is exactly?  Is the Georgia clan running the country?  More conspiratorially, some have wondered if Carter deliberately induced the recession knowing the slump would tail off and conditions would be \"improving\" around election time.  Perhaps that scheme seems ridiculous, but such is the psychological atmosphere--and it only represents relativistic politics taken to a logical extreme.</span></p> <p><span>It is not likely Carter cooked up such a strategy.  But that it does not defy the imagination underscores Carter's main weakness as president:  he has not led, he has been led.  If citizens agree with the president's own refrain that there must be \"no acceptance of mediocrity in any aspect of our private or public lives,\" then Carter will surely lose in November.  But once layers of rhetoric are peeled away--words should not obscure reality--citizens may be confronted with the disturbing notion that Carter represents quite accurately their attitudes.  He has reflected a certain ambivalence, an ambiguity in direction.  If he has lurched from difficulty to difficulty without a coherent design, if he has wavered between two extremes in both economic and foreign policy, it is only because he keeps one eye cocked at public opinion polls.  At every instance, he has not acted but reacted.</span></p> <p><span><b>S</b>EVERAL CARTER BACKERS claim that is what democracy is all about--a president should just comply with the will of the majority at a given time, even when the nation seems unsure of where it wants to go.  But why have a president if his sole purpose is to effect the tyranny of the polls?  By his unwillingness to provide leadership, Carter has unwittingly paved the way for the resurgence of conservatism, allowing well-organized interest groups with narrow bases of support--like anti-ERA forces--to arrogate to themselves political power through sheer zeal.</span></p> <p><span>Carter's presidency has frozen government into stasis.  Paradoxically, Carter gained power largely because of fragmentation of power, a fact duly acknowledged by Press Secretary Jody Powell in David Broder's latest book.  The system has worked:  Carter has fulfilled the prophesy of 1976 campaign chronicler James Wooten, who noted in \"Dasher\" that</span></p> <p><span>Carter was quick to notice that, in politics, it is often just as important to be perceived as something as actually to be that something and, as a matter of fact, that one need not be anything ideologically at all.</span></p> <p><span>We could forgive Carter his lack of ideology if he governed effectively.  Whereas his predecessors in the TV age governed by straddling the two prominent wings of American politics, Carter--to be sure, in less prosperous times--finds himself in a saddle without a horse.  The center has eroded.  As Carter's supporters justifiably point out, there are dangers inherent in cleaving too closely to a set doctrine, a grand design; consensus politics have not always produced desirable results.  In a fit of frustration, White House domestic adviser Stuart Eizenstat admitted to Broder that he longed for a parliamentary system.  This amounts to a revealing response to Carter's second question, \"Can our government be competent?\"  and it comes from the president's top domestic consultant.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>N THE DOG DAYS of this enervating campaign, it has become fashionable to gaze wistfully north and draw analogies to Canada.  Former presidential candidates such as Sen. Howard H. Baker (R-Tenn.) have called for a shortened campaign, referring to the recent Canadian elections.  In the space of a few months, Baker noted, one government fell, a federal election was conducted, and a new government installed--while American hopefuls were focusing on the New Hampshire primary.  Of course, the parallel breaks down; in Canada, the party leaders were firmly in place and had only to face each other, a mere nine months after the previous election.  Still, for Canada the process was healthy.  Issues were focused and debated, stances clearly enuniciated, and the voters given a less blurry choice than Americans will have in November.</span></p> <p><span>For a worthwhile history lesson, Carter might consider the May 1979 Canadian federal election.  Incumbent Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and his Liberal Party had held power since 1968.  The strategy of the campaign was to focus attention on Joe Clark, the inexperienced and unimpressive leader of the opposition Conservative Party.  Trudeau attacked Clark relentlessly, but neglected to provide a reasonable, positive agenda for the country.</span></p> <p><span>Most Canadians recognized Trudeau's leadership capacity as superior to Clark's.  But Clark presented himself as \"of the people,\" pointed at 11 years of Liberal government, and won the race.  There was an \"Anderson factor\" as well--the socialist New Democratic Party split the vote of the left with the Liberals, putting Clark in power through the back door.  Nine months later, Canadians tired of Clark--as the United States might grow weary with Reagan after nine months-and reelected a majority Liberal government after Clark ran an anti-Trudeau campaign.</span></p> <p><span><b>P</b>ERHAPS, THEN, Jimmy Carter should reconsider his politics of Pessimism, and recognize that he will not win by projecting a \"lesser of two evils\" image.  If liberals and moderates reject Reagan as dangerous, and fear Anderson will siphon off enough Democratic votes to propel Reagan into office, Carter must make himself an acceptable choice, rather than a weak alternative.</span></p> <p><span>To date, Carter has not seized the initiative, in the process underscoring all his familiar failings as a leader.  Here are some things he might consider:  Taking part in the presidential debates, as any responsible leader would; apologizing to Iran for past indiscretions, as any brave head of state would; sticking to his own party's platform, as any democratic leader would; implementing a foreign policy that defends human rights in practice as well as in theory; increasing aid to less developed countries; giving America's allies at least some confidence that he will stick by them; renewing his commitment to SALT II; and forging new initiatives in social programs.</span></p> <p><span>Then, maybe, Carter will prove acceptable to liberals, to all Democrats and to the country's center.  He will get their votes when he deserves them.  They want nothing more than a viable candidate of whom their consciences will approve.  As it stands, a victory is not forthcoming, and if it were, it would be an empty one.  As the man responsible for the politics of pessimism, he is the man responsible for restoring the politics of hope.</span></p>"}

SMITH</i>:  Good evening ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the first of the League of Women Voters' 1980 presidential debates.  Participating in tonight's debate will be, in alphabetical order, John Anderson, candidate of the National Unity Party, the Chair of Jimmy Carter, candidate of the Democratic party, and Ronald Reagan, candidate of the Republican party.  Mr. Carter has declined to appear in person because he says he does not want to debate two Republicans.  He also muttered something about the Iranian hostage crisis becoming unmanageable again.  Thank you gentlemen for accepting the League's invitation.</span></p> <p><span>In tonight's debate, the four journalists on our panel will be given the chance to ask each candidate one question; each of the other candidates will be given the chance to respond.  Questioning the candidates tonight we have, in alphabetical order, David Broder of <i>The Washington Post,</i> the Chair of Barbara Walters of ABC News, Martin Nolan of <i>The Boston Globe</i> and Hedrick Smith of <i>The New York Times.</i>  Ms. Walters also declined our invitation to be in Baltimore tonight; ABC News has informed us that they refuse to participate on a panel with three newspapers.  Thank you all for coming tonight.  Mr. Broder, the first question is yours.</span></p> <p><span><i>David S. Broder</i>:  Thank you, Howard.  Mr. Reagan, you've been accused of giving simplistic answers to highly complex questions on such important issues as defense and the economy.  In a political age in which it seems vital that a candidate possess the intelligence to understand all aspects of an issue, why do you think the public has responded so strongly to your brand of simple answers to complex questions?</span></p> <p><span><i>Ronald Reagan</i>:  No.</span></p> <p><span><i>Smith</i>:  Mr. Carter's chair, your response?</span></p> <p><span><i>Jimmy Carter's Chair</i>:</span></p> <p><span><i>Smith</i>:  Mr. Anderson?</span></p> <p><span><i>John Anderson</i>:  I think both Mr. Reagan's and Mr. Carter's Chair's answers speak for themselves.  They are typical of the blind words of optimism that both of my opponents have been spewing forth for months.  But the voters this year want more than promises from representatives of the major parties.  They want action and, as the candidate of the National Unity Party-</span></p> <p><span><i>Smith</i>:  Thank you, Mr. Anderson.  Your time is up.  Mr. Nolan, the next question is yours-to Mr. Anderson.</span></p> <p><span><i>Martin Nolan</i>:  Mr. Anderson, a question along similar lines.  Many people have called your speaking style bombastic and inflated, almost as though you pontificate to audiences that want to hear answers to important questions on such issues as defense and the economy.  Do you think this has been an effective campaign style, and do you intend to put more substance into your speeches?</span></p> <p><span><i>Anderson</i>:  Let me begin by saying emphatically that I believe-and believe very strongly-that the immense problems we face in our country and society-and indeed the world-today are highly complex and demand carefully considered, well thought out and clearly articulated answers that address these difficult enigmas with intelligence and straightforwardness which, perhaps, when you comprehend.  As Alexis de Tocqueville wrote after he crossed this great land, \"Americans have all a lively faith in the perfectability of man, they judge that the diffusion of knowledge must necessarily be advantageous, and the consequences of ignorance fatal; they all consider society as a body in a state of improvement, humanity as a changing scene, in which nothing is, or ought to be, permanent, and they admit that what appears to them today to be good, may be superseded by something better tomorrow.\"</span></p> <p><span><i>Smith</i>:  Is that all?</span></p> <p><span><i>Anderson</i>:  I believe so. Yes.</span></p> <p><span><i>Smith;</i> Mr. Reagan?</span></p> <p><span><i>Reagan</i>:  (nodding off)</span></p> <p><span><i>Smith</i>:  Mr. Reagan?</span></p> <p><span><i>Reagan</i>:  (Startled) Er, uh.  I paid for this microphone.  Let's make America great again.</span></p> <p><span><i>Smith</i>:  The next question is from the chair of Ms. Walters and is directed toward the chair of Mr. Carter.</span></p> <p><span><i>Barbara Walters' chair</i>:</span></p> <p><span><i>Carter's chair</i>:</span></p> <p><span><i>Smith</i>:  Mr. Reagan, your response?</span></p> <p><span><i>Reagan</i>:  I couldn't make out the question.  But I pledge here and now to the American people that should I ever become senile during my term of office, I'll, I'll (fumbling through note cards)...</span></p> <p><span><i>Smith</i>:  Mr. Anderson, your response?</span></p> <p><span><i>Anderson</i>:  In my 20 years on the floor of the Congress in the House of Representatives of the United States, I've done some things that I can't say I'm proud of today.  Perhaps the worse of those was my vote in favor of H.R. 13546, which was the bill to fund construction of deep water wells to provide irrigation to apple orchards of less than five square miles owned by minority farmers in the northwest regions of Washington state.</span></p> <p><span><i>Smith</i>:  The next question is directed toward Mr. Reagan.</span></p> <p><span><i>Hedrick Smith</i>:  Mr. Reagan, a recent New York Times/CBS poll indicates that you are now running neck and neck with President Carter.  In view of the fact that just six weeks ago, you were rated in some polls as 15 points ahead of Mr. Carter, how do you explain the volatility of the American electorate?</span></p> <p><span><i>Reagan</i>:  Well, I, too, have noticed that the crowds at rallies have been particularly loud this year, and I think, in general, that Americans are just an excitable people.</span></p> <p><span><i>Smith</i>:  I said volatility, not volubility, Mr. Reagan.  What I am asking in essence is what you feel the American people are looking for in a presidential candidate?</span></p> <p><span><i>Reagan</i>:  I'm glad you asked me that question here in Baltimore, home of the John Birch Society and birthplace of 567 men who died defending our country's honors and values in our last noble war.  But to answer your question, as Franklin Delano Roosevelt once said-(five Reagan aides gag the candidate and remove him from the studio.)</span></p> <p><span><i>Smith</i>:  Thank you, Mr. Reagan. Mr. Carter's chair:</span></p> <p><span><i>Carter's chair</i>:</span></p> <p><span><i>Smith</i>:  The last word is yours, Mr. Anderson.</span></p> <p><span><i>Anderson</i>:  As has been the case throughout history, in our country and elsewhere in the world, in democracies and totalitarian states alike, ordinary people, like the citizens I meet every day as I travel through this land of ours, have cried out for something new when the old begins to...(transmission of sound interrupted for 27 minutes)...this vast land of ours, which I have traveled for months now, speaking with people from every walk of life, the lowly to the mighty.</span></p> <p><span><i>Smith</i>:  Our time is up, Mr. Anderson.  That concludes the first of the League of Women Voters' 1980 Presidential debates.  Thank you candidates.  Thank you, questioners.  Thank you, chairs.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Anderson's Vision | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>I have just finished reading Jeffrey Toobin's editorial, \"What I did during my summer vacation,\" and I am perplexed.  By all indications, when Toobin came to Boston with the advance team in early August, he was a committed, die-hard Anderson supporter.  Now, with the impression that only he can measure the pulse of the nation, and with the egoistic idea that as Toobin goes so goes the nation, Toobin explains why John Anderson is not the candidate of moment in this election.</span></p> <p><span>Specifically, Toobin's article is fascinating for what it fails to recognize about the Anderson campaign.  His final sentence, one last jab at a campaign which he apparently considered more a job than a movement of national significance, questions Congressman Anderson's \"vision of America.\"</span></p> <p><span>How can Jeff Toobin question Anderson's vision?  How can he of all people, having traveled the country with a man who has not stopped campaigning since September of 1979, having worked across the country with field coordinators who believe unflappably in Anderson's conviction and in his goals, how can he write about John Anderson's \"lack of a clear vision for the people of the nation\"?  What Toobin's editorial signifies is one disenchanted liberal's self-indulgent attempt at journalism.  But let me try to repair the damage done by Toobin's opus.</span></p> <p><span>There is an interesting trend in the mood of the electorate.  The constituency that has begun to catch on to the Unity Compaign is the very constituency that can elect him.  No longer the darling of the academic community, Anderson has maintained his standing in the pools.  The support base has shifted toward a more representative group of the American electorate.</span></p> <p><span>At this point the Anderson campaign does have a real chance of victory.  The state-by-state polls of recent weeks show the Anderson campaign in the lead when the voter assumes that the Anderson candidacy is \"viable.\"</span></p> <p><span>All of this is well-known to Toobin, as is the real problem we are having with the press.  It is time, and this is the point that voters must understand, that we stop asking the question, can Anderson win?  and begin to ask the question, should he win?</span></p> <p><span>There is something special about Harvard University.  When I work on the streets, response is much warmer than at Harvard, When I work at other schools, I find more enthusiasm than at Harvard.  When I work at other schools, I find more enthusiasm than at Harvard.  Harvard students are part of that voter segment that is so frightened of Ronald Reagan that they are willing to vote for an incumbent president whose record they will not defend and whose credibility as president they choose not to discuss.</span></p> <p><span>My point is that intellectuals, having abandoned the Anderson campaign, will undermine what is so dear and so important to them.  People like Jeffrey Toobin, by leaving the Anderson campaign (although few have turned coat in the shiny black print of The Harvard Crimson) stand in their own way.  We are at a turning point in the Unity Campaign.  We are eligible for federal funds.  We have been endorsed by the N.Y. Liberal Party.  Nationally televised debates are coming and we stand our first bona fide chance to gain national prominence.  But right now we are vulnerable.  Until we pass up Carter in a national poll, we will be the object of much derogation.  Until then no one will believe that only John Anderson, and not Jimmy Carter, can beat Ronald Reagan in November.</span></p> <p><span>So an article like Toobin's is especially damaging to what everybody must realize is a last hope for this election.  And an article like Toobin's, because it questions the national vision of the campaign, because it attempts to measure this unique campaign with the yardstick of previous campaigns, is most damaging because it represents the kind of thinking that will surely elect Ronald Reagan come November. <b>David S.

{"title": "Somewhere in Argentina... | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Every Thursday the women stand in silent protest by the president's palace in Buenos Aires, Argentina.  They don't do much--just hold up photos of missing family members and, looking pleadingly at the pink building, weep.  Occasionally the military police of dictator General Jorge Rafael Videla drag the women away to join the ranks of their relatives--the <i>Desaparecidos</i>--the disappeared ones, who are either jailed or killed by the government.  But usually the police just watch the women mockingly.  \"They're crazy,\" one said.  \"Everyone knows that.\"</span></p> <p><span>The truth is, not everyone knows that in Argentina.  Most people will tell you they know someone who's disappeared.  And many worry they may meet the same fate.  When some Buenos Aires residents were asked about the padlocked door of a neighbor, they fidgeted.  \"Another 'disappearance'--the third this month in our building alone,\" one said.  There was an uncomfortable silence.  \"Are we next?\"  another whispered.</span></p> <p><span>Since seizing power in 1976, Videla's regime has abducted over 15,000 persons, according to Amnesty International.  Other human rights groups estimate that 30,000 have been missing since 1970.  Their crime?  \"Agitating\" against the government.  Some of these victims have actually organized against Videla--have actually bombed government buildings, killed diplomats and government officials, and openly criticized the regime.  But according to one member of the disbanded \"Montoneros\" urban guerrilla group, only a small percent of those persecuted by the government now have direct connections with the terrorist left.  \"At our heyday in 1975, we numbered only several thousand, along with other revolutionary groups, such as the ERP (Marxist People's Revolutionary Army).  By 1977, most of us were either killed or had fled the country.  The <i>Desaparecidos</i> today are generally nonmilitant family or friends.\"</span></p> <p><span>There is not much to protect the innocent.  Laws permit searching without warrants, jailing without bail, trying without defense, and condemning without trial.  If you look suspicious, associate with 'subversives,' or don't appeal to your neighborhood policeman, you can be seized without explanation.  During one of many arbitrary street document checks, a young man was ordered by a guardsman to shave his beard.  \"He told me that I looked like a revolutionary, and that he'd jail me if I didn't remove it.  So I shaved it--these guys are irrational but serious.\"</span></p> <p><span>Youths in particular are victimized.  Compared to other Latin American countries, one sees few young persons in the streets of Buenos Aires.  And those one sees are often crippled from tortures with electric cattle prods, beatings, and limb dislocation.</span></p> <p><span>Intellectuals--especially social scientists--constitute another prime target.  The government closed the Di Tella Institute, formerly one of Latin America's most renowned research centers for sociological studies, and most of its staff are missing or self-exiled.  The state-run universities offer only a highly censored curriculum in philosophy, political science, and anthropology, and the regime is considering outlawing psychiatry and psychology.  \"I'm not surprised,\" a psychiatrist said, \"They don't want people to think.\"</span></p> <p><span>The law school program has also been severely limited.  \"I decided to drop out and become an engineer,\" one former law school student said, \"when they cut Plato out of our courses.  Anyway, who'd want to be a lawyer in this lawless country?\"</span></p> <p><span>Dissenters must lead a double life.  One family had a secret door in their closet where they hid such \"subversive\" material as banned Argentine Julio Cortazar's novels, Marx's complete works, and <i>New York Times</i> articles about Argentine repression.  Although they vocally criticized the government in their apartment, in public cafes with friends they hyperbolically praised Videla's political policies.  \"You can't trust anyone,\" they explained.</span></p> <p><span>Even within the military there is some liberal dissent.  One man, speaking in muted tones at an air force base near Buenos Aires, said he joined the forces to protect himself and his family.  \"My brother was involved in leftist politics, and I was afraid I'd be indicted by extension.  This way, I hope the government will think me and my parents above suspicion and will never know we're aiding him.  But, \"he adds, glancing at a poster over his head that warns \"YOU have secrets the ENEMY wants.  Don't abuse them, \"everytime I look at that I wonder if they know about me.\"</span></p> <p><span>Because of media censorship, journalists must be equally careful.  During a visit to Cambridge in spring 1979, Robert Cox, former editor-in-chief of the conservative English language newspaper, The Buenos Aires Herald, adamantly said the North American press exaggerated the extent of repression and censorship in Argentina.  He contradicted himself six months later when he explained in Time magazine why he and his family chose to defect to the U.S.</span></p> <p><span>The strain of this double life takes its emotional toll.  One does not see many smiling, relaxed people in the streets of Buenos Aires, and according to one psychiatrist, since 1976 cases of \"psychosis\" have escalated three-fold.  \"The tension of 'when will they come for me\"?, the anxiety of not being able to trust people, the pain of losing loved ones and not being able to do anything about it is too much.  It's like being in a war zone 24 hours a day.\"</span></p> <p><span>Intensifying this strain is a sense that the military--and paramilitary--is ubiquitous.  Many phones are tapped, letters censored, and on every corner in downtown Buenos Aires is positioned a guardsman with a machine gun and German metal World War II helmet.  Even a foreigner is subject to this seemingly omniscient force.  After a week in Buenos Aires, one noticed a man following her.  When she pointed him out to friends, they frowned.  \"He's been following us for months.  He probably thinks you're smuggling arms or socialist literature to us.\"</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps one of the most frustrating strains the family of a <i>Desaparecido</i> must endure is the uncertainty of whether the missing are dead or will return.  \"The suspense is unbearable--if I knew M. were dead I would mourn and try to forget.  But this way I don't know if I should entertain hope,\" one mother said.  \"And the government refuses to tell me anything.  They just threaten me, saying I'll put my life in danger if I investigate further.\"</span></p> <p><span>Under pressure from the UN and the Carter Administration, Videla accounted for onethird of the 15,000 <i>Desaparecidos</i> last year.  But it generally does not assume responsibility for the unidentified, mutilated corpses washed up on the banks of the Plata River, or for the unmarked mass graves found outside the capitol.</span></p> <p><span>Relatives of <i>Desaparecidos</i> interviewed seemed to agree that although Isabel Peron's 1973-76 regime paralleled Videla's brutal extermination of students, leftists, and intellectuals, its death-squad was more straightforward about its deeds.  \"At least they wore uniforms, at least they phoned the newspapers to tell them what they did,\" one woman said.  \"But now you get the feeling there's evil lurking under the surface that's not being admitted to.\"</span></p> <p><span>One certainly feels something's being covered up.  A bomb creating major damage on a Buenos Aires street last fall went unmentioned in the government-run media.  In another attempt at pretense, the government has inadequately covered with cement several thousand machine gun holes in buildings where hundreds of rioting leftist students were massacred in 1975.</span></p> <p><span>There is no way to ignore the situation while in Argentina, but one can't easily escape it either.  Leaving the country is not an option for most people; in order to keep currency from leaving Argentina and to prevent political dialogue in other countries, the government is reluctant to let its citizens go abroad.  Exit visa applications can wait as long as a year or two to be granted, but even then one cannot necessarily leave--passports still remain in government custody and often are not released.  Frequently Argentines don't even bother to apply for one--out of fear.  \"I would do anything to go to the US or Europe, but what about my family?\"  laments one businessman.  \"I would endanger their lives if I sought political asylum elsewhere.\"</span></p> <p><span>Is there any possible solution to this repressive mire, other than escaping it?  Could the situation go on forever?  According to one Argentine sociologist who lives in New York City, \"Repression's been a tradition in Argentina since colonial times.  We had dictatorships 25 years before Peron.  People have known nothing else--they've been weaned on lack of liberty and learned to accept it.\"</span></p> <p><span>And the lingering militant leftist underground is dwindling, said one active member.  \"Our forces have dried up, it is no longer possible to smuggle arms through Uruguay, Paraguay, and Bolivia.  The paramilitary knows where we are; it's only time before they kill us all.\"</span></p> <p><span>The possibility of a coup from the more moderate Peronists, with whom the military has been shuffling the nation's control since 1943, seems slim.  Although the majority of urban workers and professionals are Peronists, many interviewed are afraid of participating in a violent insurrection.</span></p> <p><span>A rightist coup is not very likely either.  Last November, a group of officers to the right of Videla--the <i>duros</i>--or \"hard ones\"--failed miserably in an attempted takeover.  Videla's loyal forces were just too omnipotent.</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps the only remaining hope is an uprising organized from the outside.  Mere international pressure doesn't suffice, as Carter's and the UN's condemnation of Videla's violation of human rights has shown.  The only outcome of the long-standing disapproval was the release of newspaper editor Jacobo Timerman, his imprisonment in his apartment and a profusion of heart-shaped bumper stickers stating \"We Argentines Are Human and Right.\"</span></p> <p><span>Short of arming the revolutionary underground--an unattractive prospect for most Western governments--the only possibility for change in Argentina is an international economic boycott.  But the USSR and West Germany, which conduct a significant amount of trade with Argentina, would no doubt be unwilling to cooperate as would the United States under a conservative president such as Reagan.</span></p> <p><span>In the meantime, Argentines try to anaesthesize themselves from the stress, from the pain.  The cafes in Buenos Aires are always full, the cinema always well-attended.  People still buy their groceries and go to work, trying to ignore the underlying crisis.  As one automobile worker said, \"You keep on living.  Despite the terror, despite the hysteria, life goes on in its contorted way.\"</span></p> <p><span>The militant leftist underground is dwindling, said one active member.  \"Our forces have dried up.  It is no longer possible to smuggle arms.  The paramilitary where are; it's only time before they kill us all.\"</span></p>"}

After all, most people wouldn't read the book he was passing out--the John Birch classic \"None Dare Call It Conspiracy\"--but it presumably has little to say on the subject of the Invisible Empire.  \"Read it--see for yourself,\" he ventured, his shoulders quivering under his polyester suit.  Squinting through embroidered eyeholes, the Klansman leafed through the book, which offers conclusive proof that the Marxists who celebrate their religion on Saturday are responsible for virtually everything nasty.  \"Well, I see you're anti-minority and anti-Communist and anti-women--I guess you're all right.\"</span></p> <p><span>Had the conversation ended there, moderation, played by the Bircher, would have triumphed.  But he had to say it, courageous in a way.  \"I guess the only thing we don't entirely agree about is Blacks,\" he said.  \"What?\"  the robed figure cried.  \"What has a nigger ever done for you?  Tell me, what has one ever done for you?\"  The short guy, he blanched a little, and the words started to spill out fast--\"Oh, I know in general they're a problem, and for the most part you're right that they're a blight.  But I knew one once, this guy George Schuyler who worked for George Wallace, and he was all right...\" As he finished, another robe marched over.  \"I showed his stuff to the Imperial Wizard, and he says you have to stop it.  So get out.\"  And the little guy did--just walked away.</span></p> <p><span>The shelves sag with Marxist thought, corners devoted to the master, Engels, Lenin, even Stalin.  A chart on the wall, querying, \"How Many Hands Wield the <i>Revolutionary Worker?\"</i>  chronicles the number of party newspapers sold each week.  And Revolution Books, just outside Central Square, serves as local headquarters for the Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP).  The press conference is conducted from two sofas and a couple of chairs in the middle of the bookstore.  A press conference without press, save one <i>Harvard Crimson</i> reporter, and he looks bored.  To interest him, a local party publicist reads some statements of support for the featured attraction, Stephen Yip, U.N.  One of the U.N. Two, about to be sentenced for throwing red paint on the U.S. and Soviet ambassadors to the United Nations.</span></p> <p><span>When mainstream politicians seek endorsements, they usually ask famous people.  When the U.N. Two look for friends, they are less selective.  \"Here is a statement from a socialist doctor in Boston,\" the leader announces, and the physician stands up to deliver a short, snappy round of revolution-talk.  Other supporters include \"2 Lawyers and 2 Employees from an attorney's office in Heidelberg, West Germany,\" and \"30 inmates at the Cincinnati Workhouse.\"  Well supported, Yip answers a few questions, explaining that his was an attempt to \"expose imperialist war preparations.\"  The paint, he adds, was waterbased.</span></p> <p><span>Bill Wilkinson, Imperial Wizard, climbs out of his silver Caddy and, clad in a blue business suit, strides to the platform.  Backed by an American flag and a Klan banner, surrounded by hoods (literal use), he launches into his speech.  Starting slowly, he declares, \"I'm a segregationist, and I will die a segregationist.\"  Warming to his task, this former electrical contractor explains that mixing the races will never work because \"you cannot make unequal people equal.\"  His philosophical cards on the table, Wilkinson's job becomes easier--his only remaining task is to suggest the future course of public policy.  His program includes the shooting of Cuban refugees in the water, voting for Ronald Reagan, and putting pressure on President Carter to refer to Blacks as \"niggers\" in public.</span></p> <p><span>The speech tends to drag; the reporters, who make up a third of the crowd, keep looking over their shoulders at the 30-foot cross that will be burned to cap the evening.  But the real audience, most of whom look like they arrived on motorcycles, won't let him stop.  \"Send the fuckers back,\" they yell when he talks about refugees; and when he mentions that a high proportion of the Cubans \"don't like the things that other men like,\" they all start screaming, \"faggot, queer.\"  Welfare is unpopular, as is charity, deemed \"communist.\"  A beery tough asks one Klansman how much it costs to join.  Told $20, he replies, \"For that, can I burn two niggers a month?\"  \"The Klan has no connection to all that violence you've heard about,\" the kleagle says, and the man looks confused till he sees a radio microphone stretched in their direction.  \"Get that fucking thing out of here,\" he tells the reporter, and then apologizes profusely to the robed one.  \"That's all right--and once you join, you can do anything you want,\" he's told.</span></p> <p><span>RCP members are nothing if not eager.  I went to North Cambridge one day last spring to write a story about a party follower who had been fired for proselytizing fourth graders in his job as a gym/history teacher.  That glimmer of reportorial interest was spark enough; since, there have been visits every couple of weeks from party members bearing the newspaper and willing to talk about the revolution, more than willing.  Dawn, a party publicist, comes most often.  She speaks a strange brand of English, leaning heavily on the rhetorical question (\"Yeah, but what's at the <i>base</i> of all that?\").  There is a theory for almost everything, and as long as you buy the basic assumption--that capitalists consciously try to oppress others constantly--then it fits together pretty well.  And the inevitability part is nice--one day Dawn brought along \"The Draft Manifesto and Programme of the Revolutionary Communist Party USA,\" a thick booklet on what will happen after, with detailed discussions of the personal ownership of firearms, the place of culture, and the limits on dissent.</span></p> <p><span>The visit is important, but other things take precedence--one RCP member excused himself after a summer conversation saying only, \"I've got to go agitate.\"</span></p> <p><span>The Klan puts out a newspaper called <i>The Klansman.</i>  A special \"mini-edition,\" five million copies of which they say they are distributing across the nation, was available at the Scotland, Conn., rally; it offers a glimpse into the journalism of the Neanderthal Right.  \"Ku Klux Klan Calls For:\"  and then, in 144-point type, \"WHITE UNITY.\"  The lead article, written by Mr. Wilkinson, urges whites to \"unite and reclaim our country and bring an end to black crime.\"  Otherwise, it is a fairly dull treatise on liberal social schemes, affirmative action, \"blood money\" sent to Israel, and welfare.  More interesting is the other front-page story, which calls on youngsters ten to 17 years old to join the Klan Youth Corps.  \"Uptight about schools... or just about Negroes!!!\"  Have you 'had it' with blacks following you home to beat you up?...  Are you 'fed up' with special privileges given to blacks by the School Administration simply because they are black?  Are you really 'uptight' because White girls have to submit to being molested by crowds of grinning black thugs?\"</span></p> <p><span>If so, you should \"get on the Klan van\" by sending in $6 and organizing \"White Youth in every school along racial lines,\" adopting \"a get-tough policy with arrogant non-Whites,\" and forcing school administrators to offer \"White Cultural\" classes.  The program ends like this:  \"We want segregation of classes, followed by eventual segregation of schools.\"</span></p> <p><span>The RCP newspaper features many articles by its leader, Bob Avakian (as in \"Free Bob Avakian\").  Usually there is a political piece or two--insights on Iran or imperialist war preparations or the people raising the red flag of revolution and telling their capitalist bosses that they plan to get off their knees.  Lots of space is devoted to timely causes, often to demands that someone be freed--the U.S. Two, the Houston Park Four, the Mao Tse-Tung Five.  For several issues last winter, the theme was May Day 1980, which the party urged workers to celebrate by leaving their jobs and marching.  The edition after the event conceded that the national goal--10,000 people in the streets--had not been met, but it did insist that \"shock waves,\" pictured on the front cover, had been sent rippling through the establishment.</span></p> <p><span>The <i>Revolutionary Worker</i> appears in both English and Spanish.</span></p> <p><span>No word ever sums up an event, but \"pathetic\" does a pretty good job when applied to the first three quarters of the Klan rally.  The end, though, the end was scary.  Wilkinson led the crowd of 400 across the field to the cross and, cautioning spectators to stay out of range of the flames, distributed torches to the 40 or 50 hooded Klansmen.  After explaining the religious significance of the ceremony--\"Christ's purifying light will shine forever\"--the Wizard told his followers to light their gasoline-soaked torches.  Barking out his orders, he had them circle the cross three times and then wave their torches up and down, up and down, up and down, slowly so the whoosh could be heard.  \"Klansmen to the cross,\" he intoned solemnly; and forth they went, lighting the gas-doused burlap wrapped around it.  In a second the flames rolled up the shaft and across the crossbar; around it, Klansmen danced in ecstasy, arms spread wide, the heat and light full on their chests.  The followers, the bikers, broke the \"reverent silence\" Wilkinson had requested and began to holler:  \"Get me a nigger,\" \"Put a Puerto Rican up there, they burn well cause they're so greasy.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Kill Martin Luther Coon,\" someone yelled.</span></p> <p><span>* * *</span></p> <p><span><b>E</b>VERYONE TALKS contemptuously about radicals, repeating something someone once told them about how the far left is just like the far right.  There are some similarities--neither the RCP nor the Klan is particularly realistic, and both are hated by a good segment of society--often the same segment.  But the differences are much more important--the Klan member wants for himself; the revolutionary communist, however screwed up, wants for others.  The Klan has a vision of the past, the RCP of the future.  People can be excused for their fantasies about the future, for no proof exists that they are wrong.  So scorn the Klan, hate the Klan, pray that they go away.  But when you pass the RCP people in the Square, understand them, tell whoever you're with that their hearts are in the right place, give them a quarter for the goddamn newspaper.</span></p>"}

{"title": "The IOP Prepares For the White House Changing of the Guard | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>When the biggest and baddest at the Kennedy School of Government lumber into a seminar room to work over a major political problem, you expect some noise--if not national media chatter or awed applause from Washington, then at least the venerable murmurs of academe.  If the heavyweights square off against an issue as imposing as the transition of presidents, you might even look for Howard Cosell at ringside, narrating the blow by blow.  But the presidential transition is just the problem that Institute of Politics (IOP) director Jonathan Moore, K-School professor Ernest R. May and several of their colleagues are now confronting.  And almost no one knows about it.</span></p> <p><span>From the presidential challenger's vantage point, preparation for a possible transition is a sticky business.  The would-be chief executive must concentrate far more on winning the general election than on agency reorganization or new Oval Office drapes.  He must guard against overcommitting himself, both to prospective policies and to job seekers, but still display the confidence of a man who already sees himself lounging on the East Lawn.</span></p> <p><span>Since they are butting into this delicate situation uninvited, the K-School gurus say they do not want to pile added pressure on the challengers.  They keep their research and results private, submitting ideas and observations without attracting much attention.</span></p> <p><span>The seven-man IOP Study Group on Presidential Transition will produce two approximately 150-page studies by November.  One will go to either Rep. John B. Anderson R-III.) or former California governor Ronald Reagan if President Carter slips from the throne.  \"The purpose is not to make substantive recommendation on how to manage a specific transition,\" Moore says.  \"We look at past experiences, dating as far back as Eisenhower, and try to draw together the lessons which apply to the current conditions of society and the federal government.</span></p> <p><span>Our advantage is that we have a backlog of information and the time to analyze it,\" May says, adding that, \"The professionals' memories will be partial; we provide a context for their decision-making.\"</span></p> <p><span>Moore and other participants in the project emphasize that their research is done without interference from the Reagan or Anderson staffs.  Although \"there obviously ought to be some communication between the scholars and the professionals they are assisting,\" Moore says that as in 1968 and 1976, when the IOP sponsored similar studies, partisanship is taboo.</span></p> <p><span>Most of the researchers have had extensive experience in national government under more than one administration.  May describes his own political career as ranging from Pentagon work under Truman and Eisenhower to being \"one in the hundreds\" who wrote speeches for John F. Kennedy.  \"We don't have a problem drawing the line\" between scholarly advice and political advocacy,\" May adds.  While other Harvard faculty members have declared support for a specific camp, the transition team strives for \"an objective approach to what is good governance,\" Moore says.</span></p> <p><span>Addressing a problem such as the staffing of the enormous executive branch, the IOP study group does not distinguish very much between the Anderson or Reagan camps.  Because of the general nature of their analysis, \"the presentations really do not need to be that different,\" research fellow Al Alm, another committee member, says.  Moore, carefully avoiding an answer which would classify Reagan as the current statistical frontrunner or Anderson as a third party long shot, says the studies will be \"similar, though not identical in all aspects.\"  \"We do not have to worry so much about ideology or the latest party politics; we are talking about a historic, procedural emphasis,\" he adds.</span></p> <p><span>The last recipient of the IOP's transition primer is no longer eligible for such help.  If reelected, Jimmy Carter--whom Moore says the committee \"is in no way counting out of the race\"--will have to spend the winter between his two terms without the wisdom of Harvard.  Four years ago, however, Carter did possess a bound volume embossed with the IOP seal--and his move to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave was still far from smooth.  Many have cited the early feuding between Hamilton Jordan's Hatfields, who planned the Carter election, and the McCoys under Jack Watson, who handled the transition, as the first hint of the disorganization and confusion that has haunted the administration since.</span></p> <p><span>\"There's no way in the world we can know if this kind of thing gets implemented,\" explains Alm, who was in the Carter administration in 1976.  \"The new president has hundreds of looseleaf notebooks on his desk telling him about how to get going; he cannot read them all,\" Alm says.  \"But if I were president, I seriously think I would read this one, because most advice comes from people who are themselves jockeying for position.\"</span></p> <p><span>The researchers are not only uncertain if all their planning helps anyone, but they are also hesitant to describe the criteria for a truly successful transition.  \"You can evaluate it procedurally, but even if that looks good, something can go wrong,\" he adds.  \"The Kennedy transition seemed successful in 1960-61, but look what directly followed that:  the Bay of Pigs.\"  Unlike Moore, who declines to discuss the Carter experience in 1976, May points out the \"procedural flaw\" made in trying to separate officially Watson's staff from Jordan's.  Remembering and explaining such as lesson in this election and in the future is the job of the IOP committee, May adds.</span></p> <p><span>No one on the panel wants to discuss the specific areas covered in the report, but Moore explains that they have made an important adjustment since 1976.  \"This time we will be less prescriptive,\" he says, adding that the change does not reflect the results of the last report, but is part of \"a continuous process of experimentation.\"  The IOP director describes the group as \"aware of our limitations.  This is one way of refining our efforts.\"</span></p> <p><span>One characteristic of the transition project that has not changed is its low profile on the political landscape.  Moore openly admits that he would prefer that it receive no publicity at all:  \"The likelihood of its being used, of the scholarship being translated into action, is increased if the whole thing is kept quiet.\"  He adds, however, that the project \"has never been an outright secret.\"  If one of the two challengers wins in November, the IOP will send him the study, but if Carter prevails, the report will remain at the IOP and will be used for further research within the K-School Moore says.  Copies are not made available to the public.</span></p> <p><span>Neither of the two challengers' camps is any more eager to discuss publicly a possible transition.  Mark Rosenker, a Reagan spokesman, declines comment on the work underway at the \tIOP, insisting that \"right now we are only in the business of getting a man elected.\"  Two weeks ago, in an interview with <i>The New York Times,</i> Edwin Meese, chief of staff of the Reagan campaign, mentioned the IOP's study as one of several outside research projects that will complement the campaign's own planning.  Rosenker says that a three man group is heading a small staff of transition planners within the campaign, but he refused to name any of these staffers.  \"We would be inundated with hundreds and hundreds of job applications; we don't need that right now,\" he says.</span></p> <p><span>The Anderson campaign will postpone all transition planning until the independent candidate is certain he'll be changing addresses, Alton Frye, Anderson's policy director, says.  \"We are glad they [the IOP] are helping,\" Frye adds, agreeing that the specifics of such outside counseling should not be made public.</span></p> <p><span>Within two weeks Frye expects Anderson to announce the formation of a 20- to 25-man National Advisory Council which could eventually help a new Anderson administration settle in.  \"The usual problems of transition will not be acute for us because we will operate sequentially; the same people who might help elect the candidate will continue as the transition staff,\" Frye explains.  \"Our disadvantage is that we will start very late.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Preparing the transition report is certainly a high-risk business.\"  Alm says.  \"It can have a high payoff if we can clear something up for the new administration, though.  In any case, it is a good exercise for the Institute of Politics, and in the long run, worth the time and effort.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"This particular problem [of presidential transition] is unique to our system,\" May says.  \"We change the entire leadership of the nation, not just the top... We think we can pull together some ideas that will help.\"</span></p>"}

Act II:  No congressional inquiry of the President takes place.  Instead, Carter wins a second term in a landslide victory.</span></p> <p><span>While the script seems implausible in U.S. politics, a credible version is now being produced on the French political stage.  While first-lady Anne-Aymone is under attack for using inside sources to make a killing on the Paris stock market, adviser Michel Poniatowski is being investigated for obstructing justice, and two first cousins have been accused of following the Executive's lead in accepting diamonds from former Central African dictator Jean-Bedel Bokassa, French President Valerie Giscard d'Estaing nonetheless stands as perhaps the most secure of western leaders, facing a red carpet to reelection in 1981.</span></p> <p><span>A comparison of French and American reaction to political scandal only illustrates how far the Atlantic separates the two nations' ideas of \"the presidency.\"  While in theory the two countries maintain similar political systems, in practice they are as different as apple pie and crepe suzette.  Only two months ago, Jimmy Carter narrowly escaped Washington's heated \"Billygate,\" which made headlines for weeks and almost cost Carter the nomination.  On the other hand, throughout the many scandals that have shattered the pristine panes of the Elysee Palace since his election in 1974, Giscard d'Estaing has shown plexiglass resistance; none of the various family misdeeds threatened his right to office.  A French president piously pleading his probity to the public is inconceivable.  In France, the president stands above personal calumny, cautiously leaning on an inveterate heritage of divine right.</span></p> <p><span>How can a pluralistic democracy coexist with a monarch at its head?  The answer lies in the constitution, in the division of power, and in the personality of the \"king\" himself.  De Gaulle's Fifth Republic prescribes an almost absolute executive.  Disdainful of the \"regime of the parties\" that stalemated governments of the Third and Fourth Republics, the general reduced the role of the legislative and the judiciary to little more than docile vassals for government directives.  The system lacks the checks and balances that were deliberately built into the U.S. system, allowing Giscard to maneuver in ways Jimmy Carter could never hope to emulate.</span></p> <p><span>But with such overwhelming power, the president needed safeguards to protect him from his often unruly populace.  Accordingly, the constitution cleverly shelters the president from the responsibility of day-to-day politics while putting the onus of government failures on his appointed prime-minister.  Blame for the country's implacable double-digit inflation and ever-rising unemployment falls on Raymond Barre, not Giscard.  The government's retaliatory economics policies have become known as \"The Barre Plan.\"  Giscard operates almost invisibly, pushing Barre forward as the government's official bearer of bad news, letting him take the heat for unpopular policies.  The result:  Giscard's approval rating consistently rides a good 15 per cent higher than Barre's.  Freed from the burden of popular disenchantment with the state of the nation, Giscard can maintain a high profile in foreign affairs, a low profile in domestic turmoil, and most importantly, a distance between himself and his people.</span></p> <p><span>Further abetting an imperial presidency is the almost complete absence of the fourth power--the press.  The state controls all radio stations and television networks, assuring constant praise, or at least minimal criticism, of the president's performance.  And while the written press ostensibly escapes government intervention, lawsuits and other more indirect forms of chastisement often befall publications for printing \"injurious\" material.  If a certain newspaper seems too critical, the government instructs its faithful employees to deprive that publication of all political information.  The unfaithful quickly fall back into line.</span></p> <p><span>There are even press laws which prescribe stiff penalties for those who offend the \"honour and dignity\" of the president.  That these laws date from 1881 did not deter de Gaulle from invoking them 118 times while in office.  So when Giscard deigned to hold a press conference over the Bokassa affair, he had little difficulty dodging uncomfortable questions.  With such an arsenal of press restrictions, Giscard worries far less than Jimmy Carter about public invective.  The press' lack of freedom directly enhances the president's power, permitting him to play up the laudable and tone down the culpable.</span></p> <p><span><b>G</b>ISCARD'S position has evolved considerably from his 1974 role as the \"people's president.\"  During that election, he ran what many perceived as an American-style campaign:  psoing for informal pictures with friends and family while playing accordian, or standing bare-chested in a soccer stadium.  Once in office, he even invited garbage collectors to dinner at the Elysee Palace and once a month staged a televised meal with an \"average French family\" at their home.  But that populist touch has now all but vanished.  Today he is aloof, unabashedly aristocratic, and fashions himself a closet literary critic with a passion for Guy de Maupassant.  He has learned to manipulate the constitution and the press to serve his interests, and today projects an almost frigid aura of statesmanship.  Giscard now practices with atavistic veracity de Gaulle's most imperial trait--standing at a calculated distance form his people.  And judging from his re-election prospects, the French approve.</span></p> <p><span>Alexis de Tocqueville once wrote how, on the eve of the French Revolution, the monarchy seemed inexpugnable even to those men who were about to destroy it.  His words still apply today.  With all his monarchical attributes, Giscard stands to be the first of the Fifth Republic's presidents to complete a full first term and launch a second.  Long live the king.</span></p>"}

In 1976 they had some hope.  Jimmy Carter promised to be the first president to establish a national urban policy.  He proposed a \"new partnership\" in government to redevelop our inner cities and place some of the burden of caring for our urban poor upon the federal government.  More of America's resources, Carter promised, would be devoted to lifting urban areas out of economic distress and fiscal crisis.</span></p> <p><span>Today the people who live in our cities have lower real incomes than they did twenty years ago.  And as this poverty has spread, President Carter has failed again and again at putting his urban policies into action.  Last Friday night the legislative centerpiece of Carter's program--a bill to double the $700 million budget of the Economic Development Administration, and permitting it to perform some of the functions of a \"national development bank\"--died in a congressional conference.  Once again, the Administration couldn't overcome the regional concerns of numerous congressmen to rally support for a national program.</span></p> <p><span>Reagan's program provides big city mayors with an even more depressing alternative.  Sunday night's debate showed him unable to understand the problems that confront our cities.  When Lee May of <i>The Los Angeles Times</i> asked him what he would do to fight the \"emotional and physical\" crises of American cities, Reagan responded with one of his fill-in-the-blank answers.  \"Get the federal government off the back of <i>(blank).\"</i>  (Choose one:a) business, b) local governments, c) the American family, d) the oil companies, e) all of the above.)  Reagan chose letter \"b.\"</span></p> <p><span>The Reagan plan would turn \"back tax sources to the state and local governments as well as the responsibility for these program.\"  In other words, cities would pay all the welfare costs of their poorest citizens and cover medicaid, mass transit, educational and numerous other expenses as well.  Somehow, this program is supposed to bring America's cities out of fiscal crisis.</span></p> <p><span><b>O</b>F COURSE REAGAN plans to give cities jurisdiction over new tax sources to help pay for these hefty burdens, but he doesn't realize that cities have limited tax bases, and that to pay for the services needed by the urban poor, municipalities must reach beyond city and regional boundaries.  The booming economy of Reagan's Southwest is the other side of the equation of shifting industrialization that has caused decay in the Northeast and upper Midwest.</span></p> <p><span>When confronted with this issue.  Reagan only spouts rhetoric.  Sunday night, the Republican nominee devised an utterly nonsensical explanation of our government's inability to respond effectively to urban problems.  \"New York is being taxed for money that will go to Detroit,\" claimed Reagan, \"but Detroit is being taxed for money that, let's say, will go to Chicago, while Chicago is being taxed to help with the problems in Philadelphia.\"  Reagan failed to mention that while these cities are being taxed and then granted federal dollars, the federal government is also collecting revenues from affluent suburbs surrounding them and from relatively well-to-do regions like the Southwest.  He overlooked the <i>raison d'etre</i> of a national urban program--to funnel tax revenues from affluent, non-urban communities into poverty-stricken inner cities.</span></p> <p><span>In Sunday's debate, Reagan also outlined his plans for an \"urban homesteading\" act, a plan to make our inner cities the new \"American West.\"  Yet like most of Reagan's proposals, this romantic notion is marked by simplicity rather than substance.  The urban homesteading program would let inner city residents buy government-owned, vacant and delapidated buildings for one dollar provided that they rehabilitate them and then move in.  This sounds nice but it doesn't work.  Put simply, the impoverished homesteaders cannot afford to pay the expensive rehabilitation costs of vacant buildings.  Even homesteading programs coupled with generous mortgage subsidies may run into difficulties.  In New York City, where such programs exist, homesteading still proceeds at an excrutiatingly slow pace.  Of the 50,000 vacant and mostly city-owned housing units in the South Bronx, for example, only a handful are being renovated by homesteaders.</span></p> <p><span>Surprisingly, Reagan has stumbled into one fairly good idea about how to bring businesses back into distressed urban areas.  His endorsement of the Kemp-Garcia bill proposes to set up tax free zones in areas like the South Bronx.  It represents a move toward a more active use of the tax incentive in urban renewal efforts.  Tax incentives can help, but Reagan overestimates just how much.  Even Rep. Robert Garcia, who sponsored the legislation, thinks that his bill alone cannot revitalize the South Bronx.</span></p> <p><span>Many incentives to locate businesses in decaying inner cities, such as the abatement of state and local taxes and rock-bottom market values of land already exist in our slums.  A factory owner can buy a square foot of industrial loft space in the South Bronx for two dollars per square foot.  For the same price, he could only rent this much space for one year in northern New Jersey.</span></p> <p><span>Despite these in-place incentives for the private sector to rush to the aid of the inner cities, industry has not saved areas like the South Bronx.  \"Where has the private sector been, Governor Reagan, during the years that our cities have been deteriorating\" asked John Anderson Sunday night.  Companies have stayed out of slum neighborhoods for the same reasons that they moved out in the first place.  Businessmen fear for the security of their investment against thieves and vandals.  They question their ability to get highly skilled workforce supervisors to work in these areas, and, in the case of companies that have moved totally out of the Northeast or upper Midwest, businessmen shy away from the higher energy and personnel costs that come with operating in the North.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>AX REDUCTIONS ALONE cannot offset all these forces.  When combined with cutbacks in federal aid to distressed urban areas, they can only contribute to the long-range fiscal plight of America's cities by sealing off tax revenues for years to come.  But when used alongside other governmental efforts such as federal loans, loan guarantees, interest subsidies or direct public sector development, and when used in the right amounts at the proper time in the right neighborhoods, the tax breaks can help turn our cities around.  Only John Anderson puts the tax break in this more accurate perspective.  Jimmy Carter rejects the idea totally.  Ronald Reagan unrealistically views it as a panacea.</span></p> <p><span>The Anderson program calls for combining strong tax incentives in \"enterprise zones\" with a more traditional national urban policy that focuses on initial public sector investments; the plan aims to convince businessmen of the advantages of locating in city centers.  Anderson has discussed establishing urban reinvestment trust funds with $8 billion in federal funds circulating into cities.  This sounds very much like the Carter program proposed three years ago.  But two special challenges confront John Anderson.  The first is to bring his independent candidacy to the White House.  The second would be to convince Congress of the need for a strong, national urban policy.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Lost in Translation | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Before the border conflict between Iraq and Iran exploded into all-out war this week, at least some experts believed the U.S. missed a chance to free the 52 American hostages who, barring a surprise of major proportions, will spend their 329th day in captivity today.</span></p> <p><span>The experts--four of them, including Michael M.J. Fischer, associate professor of Social Anthropology and Middle Eastern Studies--met in Washington September 15 with Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs David D. Newsom, Assistant Secretary of State for the Near East and South Asia Harold Saunders, and other State Department officials.</span></p> <p><span>The meeting came three days after the Ayatollah Khomeini gave a speech that raised eyebrows among weary observers of the seemingly endless rollercoaster of hints, charges, denials and counter-charges that has continued since the hostages were seized last November 4.</span></p> <p><span>In the speech, Khomeini neglected the customary demand that the United States repent for past misdeeds against Iran--a demand which, in any case, the experts say only required a pledge of future non-intervention, not a full apology.  Intrigued, the State Department called together the four experts to analyze the speech and \"to try to get an understanding of the meaning, theory and purpose of repentance in Islam,\" according to Steve Grummon of the department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research.</span></p> <p><span>The experts readily obliged.  They told Newsom that Khomeini's omission was a deliberate signal--not an accident, as some Iranian politicians had claimed--and recommended that the U.S. give a quick and positive reply before hardliners added any new conditions.</span></p> <p><span>That didn't happen.  Last Monday, Secretary of State Edmund S. Muskie pledged U.S. non-interference in Iran's internal affairs, noted that a \"chapter has closed\" in Iran's history with the fall and death of the Shah, and emphasized that the U.S. \"recognize(s) the reality of the Iranian Revolution.\"  But by that time, the hostage issue had receded behind the shadow of the confrontation across the Iraq-Iran frontier.</span></p> <p><span>\"The White House staff has prolonged this crisis to an unconscionable degree,\" William O. Beeman, assistant professor of anthropology at Brown, said.  Specifically, he assailed the \"extraordinarily irresponsible\" actions of Zbigniew Brzezinski's National Security Council, which has reportedly frequently overruled State Department recommendations on Iran policy.</span></p> <p><span>In one such case, Beeman, Fischer and three other experts urged the U.S. to avoid any military intervention--two days before the aborted April 24 rescue attempt.</span></p> <p><span>Richard N. Frye, Aga Khan Professor of Iran, who has also been sharply critical of Carter administration policy during the crisis--\"I have advice, but it certainly didn't do any good\"--agrees that stubbornness and an unwillingness to bridge the cultural gap between the U.S. and Iran have prolonged the stalemate.</span></p> <p><span>\"They say 'morality, morality, morality,' talking about our support of the Shah, and all we say is 'legality, legality, legality'--the hostages.\"  In one way, however, Frye said, the two governments are in harmony:  \"They're using it (the crisis) as a political football, just like here.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "Get the Klan | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>To the Editors of The Crimson:</span></p> <p><span>William E. McKibben's article \"View From the Fringe\" (<b>Crimson,</b> 22 Sept.) was basically a liberal's attempt to equate the far left and the far right as members of the so-called unrealistic fringe, hated by a \"good segment of society.\"  This equation is the same methodology which led the bourgeois press to characterize the KKK's cold-blooded murder of five anti-Klan militants in Greensboro, North Carolina, as simply a \"shootout\" between two \"violence-prone extremist groups.\"</span></p> <p><span>The Klan does not simply have a \"vision of the past\" as McKibben states.  It is an active organization of fascist terrorists who have a long history of terror and murder against Blacks, Jews, trade unionists and the left.  Fascism is the most naked form of capitalist reaction.  The alarming growth of the KKK is a product of the deteriorating economic condition of U.S. imperialism.  Workers who are battling grinding inflation, plant closings and layoffs often perceive Blacks and non-white immigrant workers as a threat to the precious few jobs that are left and thus can more easily be taken in by fascist demagogy.  While Carter and Reagan bluster about each other's allegiances to the Klan, the KKK won a Democratic primary in southern California while stating that Republican Ronald Reagan is the man for them.  It could not be more clear that as far as the KKK is concerned, there is no difference between the Democratic and Republican parties.  Furthermore, it was government agencies--the FBI and the Treasury Department--which had paid agents to participate in the 1963 Birmingham, Alabama, church bombing and the 1979 Greensboro massacre.</span></p> <p><span>Fascism is a real and dangerous alternative for the capitalist class when it is faced with the spectre of workers' revolution.  Fascism was used by the bourgeoisie in Germany to destroy a conscious and militant working class that threatened its private property.  As U.S. imperialism decays, the threat of the Klan terrorists being unleashed against the labor movement, Blacks, Jews and other minorities becomes increasingly \"realistic\" for the U.S. bourgeoisie.</span></p> <p><span>McKibben falsely labels the Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP) as \"revolutionary socialists.\"  In fact the RCP has had precious little to do with the fight against fascism and even objectively supported the Louise Day Hicks campaign in its efforts to \"unite against Boston busing.\"  Real communists like the Spartacist League/Spartacus Youth League offer the only alternative to imperialist decay and fascism.  So when the KKK wanted to \"celebrate\" the Greensboro massacre in the labor/Black town of Detroit it was the SL and 500 predominantly Black workers who demonstrated and stopped the Klan.  And when the Nazis threatened to celebrate Hitler's birthday on April 19 in San Francisco, over 1,200 trade unionists, Blacks, Chicanos, Jews, gays and socialists supported the SL's call for a mass labor-centered mobilization and actually stopped the fascists' \"birthday party.\"  The Blacks whose relatives have been lynched and the Jews who have had Nazism tattooed on their arms understood that there is no equation of leftists with fascists and they took a side with us. <b>Barry Kallio</b></span></p>"}

{"title": "A Candle Burning at Both Ends | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Since Alexis de Tocqueville trumpeted the virtue and necessity of political participation, Americans have been, well, participating, albeit in somewhat contrived fashion.  Involvement in the political process rejuvenates the individual and strengthens the country.  With a zeal even Tocqueville might have underestimated, the elephants trundled to the Motor City last week to climax long months of participation--or, as one clever delegate with an ear for language said, \"participaction.\"</span></p> <p><span>What hath all the hoopla and brouhaha wrought?  Not much.  The convention merely reaffirmed several predictable phenomena.</span></p> <p><span>First, it nominated a man named Reagan almost a given since the New Hampshire primary.  Remember how Mr. Reagan became stern one night back before the \"Live Free or Die\" state went to the polls?  \"Mr. Green, I paid for that microphone!\"  Reagan thundered during a Nashua debate.  As the defender of America's sacred property rights, he captured the hearts if not the minds of many citizens.</span></p> <p><span>That incident has not faded from the impeccable momories of several elephants.  One delegate from the state of Florida circulated the lyrics to a song entitled, \"Mr. Green, I Paid for that Microphone,\" despite its implications for party unity.  After all, George Bush came out the villain in that unseemly Republican incident.  The circulation of the xeroxed song, by the way, was suppressed by a representative of the Reagan task force for unity.</span></p> <p><span>The second thing last week's Republican convention reaffirmed was the age-old adage of oratory.  Add one ounce of optimism to every sentence, mix with several grams of virulence directed at the opposing party or the third party candidate--especially, if applicable, at the incumbent--wave hands in frenetic form, pound the microphone with Churchillian grandeur to show strength, ask rhetorical questions the answers to which are either a resounding \"No\" or the name of the nominee, and you get a pleasant and predictable melange, certain to excite and incite the conventioneers--and to bore everyone else.</span></p> <p><span>Third, this convention showed once again that the media is the paramount consideration.  The permanent chairman warned the delegates that prime time was running short on an embarrassing number of occasions.  It worked, and the delegates kept quiet.  The convention officials made sure the \"important\" media types (the press was arranged in a convenient caste system with t.v. at the top and college publications roughly on the bottom) got on the floor, and that lesser lights stayed off.  The media operations center run by the Republican National Committee fed the journalists an endless series of press releases.  Other \"publications,\" like \"The Dick Lugar News\" and \"News about Bob Dole\" mysteriously appeared alongside prepared texts of speeches. Thrilling reading, these.</span></p> <p><span>Convention officials made the atmosphere of the arena conducive to panoramic t.v. shots in the comforting tones of red, white and blue.  Make that Red, White and Blue--especially the balloons, although they got stuck for a while.  The lighting allowed professional photographers and the paparazzi to snap good shots.  There was plenty of coffee, donuts, and above all, beer.</span></p> <p><span>The fourth thing this convention confirmed was the euphemistic meaning of the word \"involvement.\"  Put simply, everyone was on the make.  \"Let's compare notes\" was a favorite phrase among journalists.  Rumor--the highest form of convention participation--had it that Detroit loved more than a good party.  But those gathered in the city for the convention conducted their affairs with a modicum of judiciousness; they made sure that, given the convention's short life, they didn't get too deeply \"involved.\"</span></p> <p><span>Finally, there were the more conventional forms of participation.  The delegates sported colorful attire, New Jersey folk being the most original, California and Texas representatives wearing the most prominent cowboy hats.  Conventioneers joined in general merriment, singing along to old favorites like \"Dixie\" and \"I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy.\"</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps the best example of grass roots participation came from an obscure group known as the Pachyderms, who in one week expanded their operation to 29 states.  Just who are the Pachyderms?  \"A sort of Kiwanis club for Republicans,\" one delegate from Missouri said, as Mr. Reagan was accepting the nomination.  Then, <i>sotta voce,</i> he added, \"If this catches on, the Democrats will copy us, and it will be good for the country.\"  But the delegate didn't stay to hear the conclusion of the acceptance speech; a week of incessant participation, he said, had tired him out.  And most people agreed it was a good thing conventions only come along once every four years.</span></p>"}

A \"Betty Boop for President\" movement had been parading around Cobo Hall with its candidate since Sunday, and inside a bearded fellow wearing tails insisted that he, Mark Twain, not Ronald Reagan, deserved the GOP's backing.</span></p> <p><span>Ignoring a four-foot spray-painted \"NO REAGUN\" (sic) message, which appeared on the front of the convention hall despite 24-hour police protection, the messiah from the West marched into Cobo and reminded his disciples, \"This is a crusade, not a campaign.\"</span></p> <p><span>Not more than two blocks away from the 1980 Republican Love-In, another political party watched the week's festivities with a condescending smirk as it readied itself for the November showdown. The leaders of the National Unity Campaign--Michigan division for Rep. John B. Anderson (R-III.)--insist that it was only a coincidence that they opened their Detroit headquarters last Saturday, two days before their former bedmates hit town and just in time to absorb the overflow of media coverage seeping through the walls of Cobo Hall.</span></p> <p><span>\"Naturally we're pleased by the fortunate timing of our arrival here in Detroit,\" says Lorraine Beebe, the coalition's state coordinator in Michigan.</span></p> <p><span>\"But it really was a matter of chance; we were hunting for a place for quite a while, found this one and moved in as soon as possible.\"</span></p> <p><span>Two weeks ago the store front on West Congress St. that now boasts brilliant red and white bunting and the omniscient countenance of John Bayard Anderson looked like many others in Detroit--broken glass, beer bottles and splintered plywood showcased behind a smudged display window.</span></p> <p><span>Last Saturday Beebe and her troopers were making phone calls and receiving visitors in a gleaming, air-conditioned office, complete with Bunn-o-matic coffee makers and an offering of Anderson t-shirts, buttons and frisbees.  \"We work fast,\" says Beebe with a smile.</span></p> <p><span>Unlike many of her younger colleagues, Beebe is no newcomer to serious politics.  A former state senator and director of consumer affairs in Michigan, this energetic grandmother skips the usual P.R. hype, preferring to outline what she sees as Anderson's challenging, but not unpassable, trail to the Oval Office.</span></p> <p><span>Her first concern is success in Michigan's biennial primary, which falls this year on August 5:  \"The vote itself is not really important, but we see it as a dry run for November, when our candidate will be considered more of a real alternative.  Now we can find the soft spots in our campaign and firm them up.\"</span></p> <p><span>The ongoing battle to get Anderson's name on enough state ballots for the general election--he is on eight thus far--does not worry, Beebe:  \"Sure that's a hurdle we must leap, but I think it's crucial that we look very hard toward the main confrontation in the fall.  We'll get the signatures for sure.\"  Beebe and company had little trouble filling their own petition sheets, but they must wait until after the August 5 primary before celebrating Michigan's official elevation to the status of a \"safe\" state.  Anderson must receive about 4500 votes next months to qualify for the general election.</span></p> <p><span>Once the dust settles from the conventions and autumn winds chase away Detroit's stifling summer humidity, Beebe predicts a drastic change in the three-way presidential race.  \"We will pick up many of the Republicans who realize they can't support Reagan and many of the Democrats who realize the same thing about Carter.  Our candidate will become a serious contender very quickly...very, very quickly.\"  Beebe adds, \"What we hear less and less of is, 'Who is this John Anderson?' That's really gratifying.\"</span></p> <p><span>Although it is almost 8 p.m. as Beebe speaks, curious pedestrians are still dropping in to look around.  One mustachioed visitor, quickly identified by staffers as Kurt Vonnegut, chats amiably for about ten minutes before signing autographs and leaving.  \"That was Kurt Vonnegut, the author.  He just walked right in,\" bubbled Tina Rosenberg, a 20-year-old press aide.</span></p> <p><span>Rosenberg fits the Andersonite stereotype far better than the matronly Beebe.  Wide-eyed and inexperienced, Rosenberg sees Anderson not only as an alternative to two retread candidates, but also as a savior for the entire American political system.</span></p> <p><span>\"He is by far the most exciting thing in politics in this country in a long time.  His candidacy questions the two party system at a very basic level.  It jolts us into the realization that a major change is needed,\" she says.</span></p> <p><span>Ed Turanchik, Anderson's State Field Coordinator in Michigan, elaborates more coolly on the possibility of a political realignment comparable to the one which brought Franklin Delano Roosevelt to power in 1932 and solidified the New Deal Coalition.</span></p> <p><span>\"We could see new lines drawn on the political spectrum.  People like me would become active members of the Republican party, and that party would have to take on a new character,\" says Turanchik, a young man who ditched his nearly finished Ph.D. research in zoology to work for Anderson full-time.</span></p> <p><span>What seems completely missing from these and other endorsements of Anderson is an understanding of the magnitude of the born-again conservative movement that is fast weaving its way throughout the Republican party.  Turanchik calls Reagan \"a joke, a person without common sense who is living in a pseudo-reality.\"</span></p> <p><span>But while the would-be zoologist deployed bumper stickers and plotted campus rallies this week, the man he calls \"a joke\" has received nearly unanimous backing for his traditional right-wing views from all segments of the Republican party.  And above all, the GOP appears determined to remain just that, the Grand <b>Old</b> Party--no realignments, no changes.</span></p> <p><span>Faced with these unsettling realities, Turanchik and his cohorts defensively fall back on Anderson's surprisingly good showings in recent polls.  Surveys have shown the Illinois congressman garnering as much as 20 per cent of the vote and Reagan winning more than a third of the vote to beat President Carter by several percentage points.</span></p> <p><span>Of all the samplings the Anderson folks like to brag about, the ABC News-Louis Harris survey released last month is their favorite.  Harris said on June 19 that if polls showed that Anderson had a real shot at the presidential election by October, 31 per cent of the electorate would vote for the independent, equaling the number who would vote for Carter and falling only four points short of Reagan's total. \"If Anderson's apparent momentum were to continue, it is entirely possible that he could finish ahead of Carter and could press Reagan for the lead,\" added Harris.</span></p> <p><span>\"We know that we have to keep climbing, but we're certainly on the way,\" says Turanchik.  There's no doubt; we're going to win.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "Your Show of Shows | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>In the grand tradition of Broadway and Hollywood, the Kennedy School of Government brought Harvard a bit of the old sparkle and a splash of the spot light this year.  Using the glamorous Institute of Politics (IOP) Forum, a three-story atrium smack in the middle of the K-School structure, as his stage, Nicholas Mitropoulos, assistant director of the IOP, orchestrated a gala revue of presidential candidates, prominent journalists, and other luminaries.  After 105 presentations and an attendance record which would put some major league baseball teams to shame, Mitropoulos can lean back and reflect, \"I think we were pretty successful, but don't believe that we're giving up on getting Carter and Reagan.  We'll be after them in the fall.\"</span></p> <p><span>The Forum has put the K-School in the headlines and on the map.  President Carter took such a shellacking from some of his competitors, who criticized his affection for the White House rose garden from behind the Forum's simple wooden podium, that presidential press secretary Jody Powell complained in March, \"There seems to be a pattern developing that whenever any candidate for the presidency of either party experiences a major defeat, he responds by going to Harvard and attacking the President.\"</span></p> <p><span>February's Los Angeles Times-Institute of Politics Conference on the press and the primaries drew well-known journalists and politicos who entertained large audiences over three days with their acerbic exchanges and insightful observations.  Also early in the year, Bob Hope and Tony Randall shared the Forum spotlight.  But since September, Mitropoulos has been packing them in not only for the big names, but also for panels on the role Blacks and Hispanics play in national politics, feminist speakers, and intense debates between Harvard professors.</span></p> <p><span>Jonathan Moore, director of the IOP says the excitement in the Forum helps the Institute fulfill its mission of serving as a link between the ivory tower and the smoke-filled political backroom and main street.  Others at the K-School agree; no one has anything but praise for Mitropoulos's and Moore's efforts.  \"The relationship between the school and the Forum has been a healthy one,\" says Ira Jackson '70, associate dean of the K-School, adding that, \"The activities that go on there provoke intellectual curiosity and broadly disseminate information.  The Forum also provides a psychological bond for all people who work in this place.\"</span></p> <p><span>Although the Forum has clearly dominated the IOP this year, Moore points out that his organization has not cut back on the opportunities it provides for undergraduate students, on its special workshops for professionals, or on its faculty research endeavors.  \"We've been tempted to limit our-selves and concentrate more on one or another area, but we like the variety and we seem to be keeping up,\" he says.  One new project which draws from all the Institue's resources is the planning of a research center to study the relationship between government and the media.  Plans for this project are far from complete, but Moore says he and his associates are working quickly to increase the IOP's involvement in the various media.  Examples of this activity include the television series, \"The Advocates,\" co-produced with WGBH of Boston, and the books and reports that often result from IOP studies.  Moore also intends to step up direct aid to the journalistic cause through the IOP's series of seminars on specific topics for journalists.  \"The media are growing too fast,\" says Moore.  \"They didn't ask for it and they can't handle it.  We think we can help.\"</span></p>"}

Given House and Senate consent for registration, Carter may be able to sign the proposal into law as early as next week.  A little more than a month later, officials say, the government would ask 19- and 20-year-old men to report to their local post offices to register by mail.</span></p> <p><span>Egged on by the Russian invasion of Afghanistan and eager to protect his political fortunes, Carter last winter sounded a clarion call for a return to draft registration.  The allvolunteer forces are a dismal failure and registration is a military necessity, Carter told the American people in his State of the Union address.  Now, although Carter's original proposal to register men and women between the ages of 18 and 26 is no more than a shadow of its former self, the president may be on the verge of a major victory.</span></p> <p><span>Bob Mills, a staff member of the Senate Appropriations Committee--which last month approved spending the funds Carter requested--has been watching the registration proposal ever since it first went before the House.  Mills has seen a large number of White House and Pentagon lobbyists troop by his office in the past two months in search of the votes they need to secure registration.  But what surprises Mills more than the undeniably political nature of the Carter proposal is what he calls the plan's basic unworkability.  \"Frankly,\" he says, \"I just don't think this thing has been well thought out from start to finish.\"</span></p> <p><span>In late March, anti-registration forces converged on Washington to rally against registration in a gathering that reminded many of demonstrations against the Vietnam war.  Since then, however, anti-registration activity on college campuses and across the nation has diminished significantly.  Anti-registration spokesmen attribute the downswing in part to a natural attitude shift that accompanies the end of any school year.</span></p> <p><span>\"I don't think that people are any less concerned about registration,\" Nora Leyland, a spokesman for the Boston Alliance Against Registration and the Draft says, adding \"But the end of the term is here and people have to pass their finals.\"  James Bristol, director of the national anti-draft effort for the American Friends Service Committee, concurs with Leyland's judgement but declines to explain the \"cooling off\" period of April and May.</span></p> <p><span>Bristol and spokesmen for other national anti-registration groups, however, point to the reaction that greeted Carter's program immediately after the president's speech.  Students across the nation demonstrated against the president's plan, and at Harvard more than 800 turned out on one of the coldest nights of the year to protest the proposal.  But since the bill entered Congress in February, registration news has faded from the pages of newspapers and activism has decreased.</span></p> <p><span>\"The Congressional decision keeps dragging on and on,\" Bristol says, adding, \"Maybe people are fed up with that.\"  Steven Leifman, national director fo the Coalition of Independent Colleges and University Students, suggest that \"students don't really feel that registration is that big of a threat--it's not something that's going to hurt them tomorrow.\"</span></p> <p><span>If and when Congress passes the president's proposal, anti-registration activists predict mass protests on college campuses and elsewhere.  David Landau '72, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union and deputy director of the National Coalition Against Registration and the Draft, a group of about 50 religious, peace and student organizations committed to fighting the president's plan, says that the present belies the future.  \"There's a lot of brooding underneath the surface,\" Landau says.</span></p> <p><span>Up until now, Landau contends, a number of dissatisfied people in the country have had nowhere to focus their energies.  If instituted, draft registration will \"provide a focus for the national debate over military and foreign policy,\" Landau says.  Bristol echoes that judgment.  \"The opposition isn't dead,\" Bristol argues.  \"Once it becomes law--and the dates are announced for registration--there's not only going to be a lot of non-registration but also civil disobedience at post offices\" and other forms of protest.</span></p> <p><span>Administration spokesmen disagree with opponents predictions.  \"Congress has already taken all the heat it's going to take for registration,\" says one White House insider.  Both pro- and anti-registration forces agree that if registration begins during the summer--as now seems likely--any forms of protest would be severely diluted.</span></p> <p><span>Estimates vary greatly over what would happen if registration became law.  Laudau says 40 to 50 per cent of the 4 million men who would be required to register may not comply.  He cites a poll of University of Wisconsin freshmen, in which 35 per cent of respondents indicated they would not register and another survey by Blackdata, Inc., which indicates that three of every four Black men born in 1960 or 1961 prefer the current system of an all-volunteer force.</span></p> <p><span>White House spokesmen deny such claims.  \"No one really knows what's going to happen,\" says one administration lobbyist.  \"The mood out there is nothing like what was going on in Vietnam.\"  Mills says that while the administration  has been downplaying the possibilities of noncompliance, \"they have not produced anything to support their case.\"</span></p> <p><span>At the very least, Landau argues, non-compliance rates will match 1973-74 levels of about 10 per cent.  \"Even if there's only a 5- per-cent non-compliance,\" one Senate aide points out, \"you'll still have a possibility of 200,000 felony cases.\"  This time, moreover, Canadian officials have promised to barricade the roads leading north.  Analysts point out that the administration has not made careful plans in case of massive non-compliance.  The Justice Department is not equipped to catch up with large numbers of non-registrants.  Even if it did find all the offenders, one lobbyist points out, the sudden barrage of 200,000 felony cases would saturate the nation's courts.</span></p> <p><span>Some anti-registration activists feel that the government's real problem will be those people who do not vocally denounce registration but simply ignore the president's order.  When he testified before the Senate Appropriations Committee, Bristol warned its members that there's going to be a lot of \"quiet absence.\"</span></p> <p><span>Even if the Selective Service System (SSS)-- which currently sports a \"skeleton crew\" of 100 employees nationwide--can gear up to carry out nationwide mail registration, its problems would be far from over.  \"Implicit in the president's post office plan is that the registrants will keep the SSS informed of their whereabouts,\" Mills points out.  \"Anyone who thinks that 19-and 20-year-olds will stop to fill out a 'change of address' form has his head in the sand,\" he adds.</span></p> <p><span>Officials on both sides of the question, however, say the greatest challenge to any registration effort may occur in the courts.  Although the registration plan before the Senate does not include women--a House subcommittee easily quashed such efforts earlier this year--Hatfield or another registration opponent may introduce such an amendment.</span></p> <p><span>A federal district court in eastern Pennsylvania is finally hearing arguments in a 1971 case that challenges the nation's registration system on grounds of sexual discrimination.  Observers say the case may reach the Supreme Court, and, if it does, would not only challenge the legality of male-only registration, but also open the doors to innumberable similar challenges.</span></p> <p><span>An even more serious question, in Mills' opinion, is what the Justice Department plans to do about people who request alternate service or declare that they are \"conscientious objectors.\"  The bill the Senate is considering includes an amendment introduced by Hatfield, asking registrants to indicate whether they will seek conscientious objector status, and even SSS studies indicate that such figures could be high.</span></p> <p><span>In January, the director of the SSS issued a report in which he concluded that premobilization registration was not only unnecessary, but fraught with technical and financial difficulties.  Later that month, the president repudiated the report's findings by asking Congress to revive draft registration.  Six months later, the president's call for registration seems to have posed many more dilemmas than it may solve.  If congress this week approves the president's plan to begin registering 19- and 20-year-old men for the draft, the protests which follow that action may only be the start of the government's problems.</span></p>"}

The State Department granted her the visa, which will allow her to stay in this country indefinitely, because she has relatives who are U.S. citizens.  Poorooshasb is one of a number of students exempted from President Carter's \"hard-line\" policy of not renewing Iranian students' visas when they expire.  Carter's policy of denying entry to the U.S. to Iranians will still indirectly affect Poorooshasb, though, for it means her parents will not be allowed to attend Commencement.</span></p> <p><span>Guive Nifendereski, a fifth-year student at Tufts' Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, is not so lucky. he will probably spend the next few weeks in court.  Nifendereski faces a possible trial, and then appeal proceedings but he has not broken any law.  He is an Iranian student who holds a visa that will expire soon, and although he still has a year left at Fletcher, the State Department will not renew his visa.  He must leave the U.S. within ten days after his visa expires or the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) will deport him.</span></p> <p><span>Almost seven months ago, in the wake of the seizure of 53 Americans by militant students in Tehran, the White House demanded that all Iranian students in the U.S. register with INS officials in their area.  Although some officials threatened that deportations would begin immediately, little happened.</span></p> <p><span>But in early April, after a United Nations commission which visited Iran failed to produce quick results toward obtaining the release of the hostages, Carter announced a new \"hard-line policy toward Iranian students.</span></p> <p><span>Following Carter's announcement, the State Department sent a directive to INS directors, instructing them to turn down all applications by Iranians for extensions of visas and for permanent residency.</span></p> <p><span>The directive exempts three groups from the policy:  Iranians with immediate relatives in the U.S., applications for political asylum and those who can present humanitarian (read medical) reasons.  Since April, approximately 4000 students have left the U.S., many without completing their studies, as a result of the policy, and 10,000 more of the 70,000 Iranian students in the U.S. may be required to leave by next fall.  About a quarter of all Iranian students hold dated visas, the kind that expire each year (usually around May 31), and must be renewed by the INS.  The remainder hold \"duration of status\" visas that are valid until the students finish their studies.  The distinction between \"duration\" and \"dated\" visas arises from a bureaucratic decision of the INS to reduce the extensive record-keeping system that \"dated\" visas required.</span></p> <p><span>Local INS officials report that about 200 Iranian students have left the Boston area since early April, and that almost 100 are currently involved in deportation hearings.  After the INS labels students, most leave the country within the 15-day deadline, but INS has had to forcibly deport two students, and, in one instance, a student assaulted an immigration officer who was attempting to process the student's deportation papers.  \"They are not pleased with the policy,\" Timothy Whelan, deputy director of the New England district INS, says simply.</span></p> <p><span>Faculty and administrators at several U.S. universities criticized Carter's policy, which affects only those holding dated visas, as arbitrary.  Many have expressed disapproval of the INS policy and disagree with White House claims that the measures will aid in obtaining the release of the American hostages.</span></p> <p><span>At Harvard, where 15 of the University's 37 Iranian students will be required to leave by the fall, officials, despite their quiet words, have lobbied against the order.  President Bok, for example recently joined Tufts' president Jean Mayer in signing a letter to Secretary of State Edmund S. Muskie which calls for repealing the INS policy.  Bok says he doubts the government's policy will affect the hostage situation and labels Carter's motivations \"rather obscure.\"  State Department spokesmen confirm that the department has received Bok and Mayer's letter but decline to say what their response will be.</span></p> <p><span>Whelan sees a direct link between the hostages and Iranian students in the U.S.  In light of the government's unsuccessful efforts thus far, Whelan says, Carter's policy toward Iranian students might help with the hostages' release.</span></p> <p><span>But most local experts disagree with Whelan and the government.  Richard Frye, Aga Khan Professor of Iranian, calls Carter's measures \"absolutely incredible\" and \"stupid.\"  \"The idea is just wrong,\" Frye says, adding, \"The Iranian government is not going to be moved to release the hostages by this action.\"  Roger Fisher '43, Williston Professor of Law, who has written extensively about the situation in Iran, argues that the White House has made \"a great mistake to respond to the madness in Iran by madness over here.\"</span></p> <p><span>Other universities in the area have responded to the problem with varying degrees of concern for their students.  In addition to the letter Mayer and Bok signed, Mayer sent a letter to <i>The New York Times</i> last December, soon after Carter first announced his policy, saying that the action \"insults and attacks\" the students, and calling for repeal of the measure.  Mayer also promised that Tufts will furnish legal aid to its students and is prepared to pursue any kind of legal action on their behalf if it will help them to remain in the U.S.  But since the Supreme Court has already declared that the U.S. is under no obligation to renew visas for any foreign citizen, and specifically Iranian students, it is unclear if Mayer's offer means anything concrete.</span></p> <p><span>The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has displayed the greatest support for its students of any area university.  In a special meeting held on May 29, faculty members overwhelmingly adopted a resolution \"deploring\" the government's action and questioning its constitutionality.  The faculty resolved to \"take appropriate action\" and to \"offer legal support... for principled court challenges to these policies,\" but it failed to devise a list of specific steps.</span></p> <p><span>Shahrokh Rouhani, an Iranian graduate student at Harvard, says action by MIT and other local universities will aid in speeding the release of the hostages.  Rouhani, who holds a \"duration-of-status\" visa and may remain at Harvard until he graduates next June, says the White House policy stems from a basic misunderstanding of the aims of the Iranian nation and the nature of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's government.</span></p> <p><span>Rouhani's uncle was imprisoned by SAVAK, the shah's secret police force for many years because of his activities in the National Front, and agents of the shah harassed other members of his family.  Because of Iranian experience with abuse at the hands of American-backed forces, Rouhani says, they see the action against the students as just another in a long line of injustices.  Far from causing them to consider releasing the hostages, Carter's hard line will simply strengthen their resolve to persevere until the U.S. apologizes.</span></p> <p><span>But despite the feelings of students like Rouhani and efforts of area universities to rectify the INS policy, Carter has not given any indication that he will back down on his stance.  Neither Bok nor Mayer, who say they have spoken with government officials, have received any signals that their efforts are affecting decisions made in Washington, and both offer only guarded optimism for the fate of Iranian students.</span></p> <p><span>Even if the State Department does reverse its order and permit Iranians to continue their studies in this country, it will be too late for the thousands of students who have already been forced to leave.  Many voice doubt that Carter will reverse his decision in an election year, and, if he does not, Nifendereski and the many students like him may be returning to their homeland sooner than they thought.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Keeping Commencement Happy | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><i>\"The exercises were much as usual.  Some were tiresome, others I could not hear.  The whole thing is a tax upon the patience of all excepting such as have relations present....  The glory of former days so far as it consisted of bustle, show and glare has departed, perhaps in truth there is no very great loss by the change.\"</i> <i>--Charles Francis Adams, Class of 1810, commenting on Commencement circa 1825</i></span></p> <p><span>On Friday, September 23, 1642, nine \"young men of good hope\" received degrees at Harvard's first Commencement.  Notables such as Governor Winthrop arrived by ferry or carriage.  The valedictory oration, delivered by one of the many ministers present, closed by invoking the congratulations--not the blessings--of God, and President Dunster personally presented each with a \"Booke of the Arts.\"</span></p> <p><span>Today, some 25,000 will pack Harvard's hallowed Yard to march, to gawk, or to enter the \"company of educated men and women.\"  The ritual has long since hardened into a sturdy tradition.  As Samuel Eliot Morison writes in his history of Harvard, Thomas Aquinas migh recognize today a lineal descent from the Commencement ceremonies he often attended in the 12th century--even then, they were marked by caps and gowns, Latin orations and general confusion.</span></p> <p><span>To ensure a modicum of method amid the madness, the Associated Harvard Alumni (AHA), in characteristic University fashion, has a committee, which clings to its arcane title of the Committee on the Happy Observance of Commencement.  Or, as those involved like to say, the \"Happy Committee.\"</span></p> <p><span><i>The festive spirit of Commencement has a longstanding heritage.  Morison describes the development of Commencement from \"a purely literary occasion\" to a \"sort of puritan midsummer's holiday.\"  In 1681, when President Oakes perished shortly before Commencement, the authorities seeking a sober ceremony felt compelled to restrict students to a provision of one gallon of wine per man.  Despite that one prohibitive graduation, the tradition of imbibement was propagated, climaxing in the \"Plum cake scandal\" of 1693, when kill-joy President Mather outlawed the tainted pastries, deeming the custom \"dishonourable to the Colledge.\"  Needless to say, in spite of various fines imposed by Mather, the tradition survives in one form or another.</i></span></p> <p><span>Just what does the Happy Committee do?  For starters, the 20 alumni who compose the group perform variegated duties, ranging from the chief marshal's luncheon (attended by honorary degree recipients and University bigwigs), seating and ushering, organizing the procession of alumni, escorting the older alumni in the march proper, and managing the \"tree spread\" (lunch for alumni in the 50th reunion class and older).  The committee as a whole meets but once a year, because its members are so well-trained in their respective tasks.</span></p> <p><span>But as Morris Gray '43, chairman of the Happy Committee, explains, \"We basically stand around and look pretty.\"</span></p> <p><span>For his part, Gray \"calls\" the parade in the afternoon, barking instructions to the alumni to expedite the procession into Tercentenary theater.  The Happy Committee is in charge of the \"aides,\" distinguished members of the 25th reunion class.  Harvard aides and marshals are accorded the honor of donning black top hats, white four-in-hand ties and cutaway coats, while their Radcliffe equals sport white dresses with crimson sashes.</span></p> <p><span>\"That silly paraphernalia costs so much to rent now,\" M. Greely Summers '42, a member of the Happy Committee, says.  \"But if we didn't wear it, it would detract from the dignity and decor of the situation.\"</span></p> <p><span><i>1860's Commencement dinner featured nine brands of champagne, and the feast itself included lobster, pheasant, beef, and innumerable delicacies.  This seems a substantial improvement from Charles Francis Adams' day.  His remarks on the post-ceremony meal:  \"The usual scramble for a bad dinner took place and the usual psalm, after which we left as rapidly as possible.\"  The custom of the Commencement dinner has faded from the scene for unknown reasons.</i></span></p> <p><span><i>Commencement in 1886 marked the University's 250th anniversary.  Then-president Cleveland declined the offer of an honorary degree, claiming he wasn't properly qualified.  Franklin D. Roosevelt '04, Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy '40 all received honorary degrees before they acceded to the presidency.  Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford and President Carter have not garnered honoraries.</i></span></p> <p><span>Gray stresses that the afternoon portion of what most people refer to as \"Commencement\" is really the annual meeting of the AHA.  \"After degrees are given in the morning, the University stops and the AHA takes over,\" Gray says, adding, \"The morning Commencement ceremony is a serious, inspiring occasion.  The tenor we aim for in the afternoon is a happy occasion.\"</span></p> <p><span>The keynote speaker, and even \"high officials of the University are essentially guests,\" Gray says.  So in reality, the Committee on the Happy Observance of Harvard Commencement has little to do with Commencement itself, while the University has little to do with the afternoon ceremonies.  But the Happy Committee maintains its name, Gray says, because of tradition.</span></p> <p><span>As chairman of the Happy Committee, Gray makes one report a year--at the March meeting of the AHA.  \"We report that it's not going to rain on Commencement day,\" Gray explains.</span></p> <p><span><i>In 1940, President Conant wanted to impress upon the Harvard community the urgency of the international situation; he invited then Secretary of State Cordell Hull to deliver the main address.  Hull obliged, noting in his speech the rise of fascism in Europe and the highly unstable status quo in East Asia.  He also warned the graduating seniors that they should be prepared to fight for American ideals in the near future.  Hull's remarks were greeted with catcalls, David A. Aloian '49 executive director of the AHA, says.  Apparently, the seniors had hoped for a happy Commencement.</i></span></p> <p><span><i>Seven years later, another secretary of state spoke at Commencement.  Gen.  George C. Marshall found the occasion propitious enough to announce his celebrated Marshall Plan for the revitalization of Europe in the wake of wartime devastation.</i></span></p> <p><span>Last year the alumni procession lasted 50 minutes, 20 minutes longer than scheduled.  \"The trouble spot was in front of Widener.  People squeezed into one lane,\" Aloian, who serves on the Happy Committee, says.  \"This year, we'll aim for a crisper start to the parade, better movement, and wider lanes.  We're going to try to keep the walkway wide--three abreast--to break the Widener bottleneck,\" he adds.</span></p> <p><span>Aloian concedes that since the procession is led by the oldest mobile alumni, the Happy Committee can only speed up the parade to a limited extent.  But the Happy Committee does prepare for unfortunate contingencies.  As Gray says, \"There's always a doctor who watches the head of the parade.\"</span></p> <p><span>With the crowds at recent Commencements swelling to record numbers, the aides and marshalls under the jurisdiction of the Happy Committee have had to be more forcible in keeping the general public out of reserved seats.  \"The aides are not really trained in crowd control.  But they try to do the most polite job possible,\" Aloian says.</span></p> <p><span><i>The rhythm of Commencement in the spring of 1970 was broken by the appearance of a group of community activists seeking to disrupt the normally staid proceedings, to draw attention to Harvard's expansion in the Riverside area of Cambridge.  Led by Saundra Graham--later elected a city councilor--the \"counter-commencement\" group was allowed to speak its piece after last minute behind-the-scene bargaining.</i></span></p> <p><span><i>As rain poured down on observers two years ago, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn used the Commencement podium to launch a biting diatribe at the West's value structure.  The voice of the interpreter blended with the Nobel Prize winner's producing a grating effect and making listening difficult.  But his words rang out far beyond the confines of the Tercentenary theater; a rebuttal from Rosalynn Carter and mixed public and press reaction were not long in coming.</i></span></p> <p><span>Against the historical backdrop, each Commencement seems fleeting.  The caps and gowns and top hats and sashes, the remnants from the days of Thomas Aquinas, the pomp and splendor and complacency and controversy combine to create an image of both continuity and peculiarity.  Captain George Walsh of the Harvard police, who has witnessed the last 30 Commencements, lends perspective to this intangible double-life:  \"Every one is just as great as the next, but every one is a little different from the last.\"  And today will probably bear out Walsh's maxim; the legacies of the past will melt together with the particular character of 1980.  With the help of the Happy Committee, of course.</span></p>"}
{"title": "The Meaning of Morality | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>W</b>ITH A CONVULSIVE SHOUT, America's leaders are dragging it down the road to war.  For the new militarism, getting worked up into a fighting frenzy is more important than knowing when, where, whom or why to fight.  The brief spell after Vietnam under which American leaders sought to understand why that tragedy occurred and how to prevent it in the future ended quickly enough; today a typical attitude about foreign affairs seems to be, \"America has taken enough shit from the world and ought to start flinging some back.\"</span></p> <p><span>The U.S.'s return to gunboat diplomacy and covert operations--in President Carter's Iranian rescue mission and Congress's freeing the Central Intelligence Agency to roam foreign nations at will--certainly signals the start of that flinging.  But Americans who feel that their government has a right to do what it wants in the world as a result of a few years of a nominally moral foreign policy are turning their backs on every lesson in international relations the world has given the U.S. since World War II.</span></p> <p><span>The Iranian crisis--which remains a crisis, despite Carter's best attempts to wish it away--has crystallized this dangerous attitude.  The U.S. has reached an impasse in Iran as much because of its own refusal to take responsibility for its past as because of the intransigence of the Iranian militants.  American claims of international law sound good in Washington, but in Tehran, where a C.I.A.-engineered coup placed the shah in power in 1953, Uncle Sam looks less innocent.  The rights of the hostages are important, but where was American concern for human rights while the shah's secret police tortured his political opponents?  America ought to recognize its complicity in the fate of Iran and publicly repudiate the Shah; the hostages' return might well be furthered, but more importantly, Iranians and non-aligned nations everywhere would see that America understands the criminality of much of its past, and resolves not to let history repeat itself.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>N FACT, OF COURSE, the trend in both public opinion and government action seems, ironically, exactly the reverse.  As a consequence of a crisis the U.S. got into because of an arrogant, immoral foreign policy, our leaders decide to step up the arrogance and immorality.  Soon after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, for example, Carter proposed massive aid to Pakistan--like the shah's Iran a repressive military dictatorship.</span></p> <p><span>The ineptness of much of Carter's foreign policy continues to stupefy the world.  The bungles are endless--from the buck-passing and double-dealing following the vote in the U.N. Security Council on Israel's West Bank settlements to the recent diplomatic <i>faux pas</i> of the president's absence at Yugoslav leader Josip Tito's funeral.  One reason for the perpetual inconsistency of Carter's diplomacy, of course, is his stage-fright:  every move on the international stage is selected to please the audience of American voters, not to further a coherent foreign policy.  It is precisely Carter's failure to solve domestic problems--most notably his inability to present an effective energy program--that have led him to seek the warrior's glory around the globe.</span></p> <p><span>Carter deserves the most blame for irresponsibly aggravating war fever; his absurd statement that the invasion of Afghanistan constituted the gravest threat to world peace since World War II has become a sitting target for commentators.  But behind Carter's hysteria stands a serious policy of confrontation with the Soviet Union that makes no sense internationally, though plenty for Carter's domestic political survival.</span></p> <p><span>We oppose a return to draft registration, and the functioning draft that would inevitably follow, because the motivation behind it is purely political.  Neither American military needs nor the nation's security requires this step; only Jimmy Carter's future seems to demand it.  The war 19-and 20-year-olds might die in would be to defend America's inability to secure its energy independence, not our national interests at all, as the Carter Doctrine wildly states.  We urge students to fight the reinstitution of draft registration, and if--as is likely--Congress approves the bill and Carter signs it, not to comply with the law.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>MERICAN FOREIGN POLICY under Zbigniew Brzezinski is returning to its state under our last <i>realpolitik,</i> government-professor National Security Adviser:  a nearsighted, bipolar view of the world which cares less about a nation's welfare or common interests with us than about its value in the life-or-death wrestling match between the two superpowers.  In a world that has a third arena no one can ignore, the stupidity of such a view could be fatal.  Looking at developing nations merely as pawns in the game against the U.S.S.R., with a blind eye to their internal affairs, is what first associated the repression in places like South Korea and South Vietnam with the American name across the world.  Tying America's policies to individual leaders like the shah not only makes a mockery of American principles; it does not even further our self-interest.  Such autocrats usually topple from power after revolutions spawned by their own repression, leaving America with even fewer friends.</span></p> <p><span>A consistently moral foreign policy--not Carter's abortive, capricious \"human rights\" campaign--would offer financial aid to nations where it can save lives and promote economic health; and military aid only to those governments which we know will not use American arms to invade their neighbors or turn American guns against their own people.  If we hope to convince the Third World that our system of government is superior to the Soviets', it simply won't do to continue making ourselves laughing-stocks every time we send a shipment of arms to a dictator.  If we sacrifice our values every time we try to defend them, why bother?</span></p>"}
{"title": "The Right Sacrifices | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>HE FEELING in America today, the inarticulate upwelling of the nation's collective consciousness, is that the country is \"in trouble.\"  Fear fills the minds of Americans, from the people who can't feed their families, to the elderly who wonder what will heat their homes next window, to the young men and women who expect to fight in whatever war looms ahead, to the minorities and the poor with no future except more of the same.  So far, this fear has no object, but hovers ominously in the streets like a waiting thundercloud.</span></p> <p><span>Why this national <i>angst?</i>  The commonplace explanations--that at home Americans have given up on their government's ability to make life better for them, and abroad they see their nation humiliated in a world they can no longer control--just aren't enough.  Political cynicism in America goes back at least as far as Ben Franklin, and American international omnipotence was always more the offspring of wishful thinking than of cold reality.</span></p> <p><span>The fear in America today springs rather from a sense that the American lifestyle may have to change, a sense clumsily fostered by our national leaders.  Despite the stubborn persistence of poverty in some groups and areas and new troubles caused by exorbitant inflation, life in the United States today is comfortable and gratifying for most of its citizens.  When President Carter or his economic-policy underlings tell them they will have to give up some of their comforts, the first response is a reflexive \"no!\" that echoes out of the history of rugged American individualism.  Only thereafter does the all-important \"why?\" appear in people's minds and on their lips.</span></p> <p><span>The national leadership had better answer this \"why?\" before it repeats its request for people to reduce their standard of living.  Sacrifice is an emotional thing--people won't do it unless their hearts are in it and they can see everyone is sharing the burden.  Drivers won't want to pay huge gas taxes when they read about the obscene end-of-year oil company profit figures that helped double the price of gas in the first place.  The poor will hardly understand the need for them to sacrifice the programs that keep them above the poverty line when they see their government spend $60 billion on a giant shell-game for its missiles.  Families will miss the logic of why they have to earn less and borrow nothing as the only cure for aching inflation, when they realize this policy aims to placate only the business community, lately the biggest beneficiary of the federal government.  The unemployed will miss the point of an economic policy that deliberately deprives them of jobs for the sake of the few tenths of a percentage point their misery <i>might</i> lower the inflation rate.  Young people will not make the biggest sacrifice of all if the war they're asked to fight in protects something as sacrificeable as oil profits and not the national interest at all.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HERE <i>ARE</i> sacrifices Americans should make, and probably would if the government stopped relying on the fiction of the free market and took decisive action.  The 12-mile-a-gallon Cadillac ought to go the way of the grass-eating brontosaurus, and government regulation should drive it to extinction if natural selection doesn't.  Immediate price controls and rationing of gasoline would instantly force a reduction in oil consumption and dependence on imports--and this is a sacrifice Americans have long been willing to make, but this administration has timidly avoided.  There are sacrifices aplenty to be made everywhere in society--by the profiteers in the weapons industry, by the bankers charging never-before-contemplated interest rates, by the energy companies growing rich off the price-rises of the oil cartel and then editorializing about the evils of regulation, asking for the freedom to make even more.  The government should ask them to sacrifice at least as much as the average American; they can afford much, much more.</span></p> <p><span>Unless government takes the steps today to channel the fears of Americans towards the right sacrifices--and insures that all segments of society chip in--we will end up making the wrong ones for decades to come.  We will fight wars to defend a national interest determined in a few corporate boardrooms.  We will continue to polarize our society economically so that a handful maintain their standard of consumption while many sink into an abyss of hopeless misery.  Worst of all, as we struggle to save the least desirable qualities of the American way of life, we will lose hold of its most valuable freedoms.</span></p>"}

At Harvard more than 800 students braved the deadly cold of a winter night to rally against the president's program.</span></p> <p><span>But as Carter's proposal got mired in Congressional bureaucracy, student demonstrations subsided and Congress began to scrutinize the plan.</span></p> <p><span>In the spring, a House committee emphatically rejected Carter's call for registering women and eventually sent a proposal to the floor calling for post-office registration of men born in 1960 and 1961.  The House passed the proposal and sent it on to the Senate.</span></p> <p><span>Carter learned a basic lesson in civics when his proposal fell on hard times in the Senate.  A subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee learned that federal agency budget requests would overrun budgetary ceilings and Carter's plan--which called for a $13.3 million budgetary supplement-- was put on the back burner.</span></p> <p><span>Eventually, the proposal wound its way through the Appropriations Committee, but not without carrying an amendment by Sen. Mark O. Hatfield (R-Ore.) asking registrants whether they would be conscientious objectors.</span></p> <p><span>That amendment may require the House to reconsider its earlier vote.  But that won't happen until the Senate, which is considering the proposal now, gives its stamp of approval to the plan.</span></p> <p><span>And Hatfield's promise to filibuster the bill probably won't speed up the already slow process.</span></p> <p><span>Up in Boston, apparently a few people did not believe that Hatfield's plan would succeed.  A group of five, including two Harvard students, staged a sit-in at the Boston offices of Sen.  Edward M.

Not surprisingly, these men often took whatever jobs they could get:  Cameron Blaikie Jr. '30 reports positions as an apprentice iron worker, salesman for a chimney-cleaning oufit, bill collector, and finally a railroad man.</span></p> <p><span>\"During the following four years, dedicated to avoiding bankruptcy, I saw history repeating itself,\" John D. Elliot Jr. writes, adding, \"the great blunders had been and were continuing to be made by the Experts, in the interest of those who were unconcerned with reversing the Depression but rather, profiting from it.\"</span></p> <p><span>Foreign service officer Walworth Barbour says that even overseas while working for the government, the Depression seemed very close.  \"Everyone was given one month's leave without pay and we were stuck--all because the government wanted to cut down,\" he says.</span></p> <p><span>Another man's parents had him committed to a mental institution in Vermont because he couldn't find a job.  After eight years of sweating out to see a lawyer, he finally secured his release, although the courts have never awarded him damages.</span></p> <p><span>\"Papers were served on the institution; my father showed up and said he wasn't interested in contesting the case, and the hospital agreed to my unconditional release,\" he writes.</span></p> <p><span>The world inside the confines of the College had been a hard world of a different sort, the end of the '20s, a different era from the beginning of the '30s.</span></p> <p><span>Many of the Class of '30 moved into the River Houses with an eye toward a room in the Yard senior year.  Spencer Brown '30 says he remembers most vividly conversations with his classmates about \"life, God, science, and all those things we didn't know much about.\"  He adds that, as a scholarship student, he felt the constraints of social class, symbolized by the automobile and the gentleman's C.  \"It was easy to distinguish between those with the Back Bay accents and cars and those who were interested in getting on the Dean's list and keeping their scholarship,\" he says.</span></p> <p><span>Not everyone could live in college dormitories sophomore year, and a bad lottery number meant removal to special \"slums\" long gone from the Square.  \"You wouldn't have been surprised to be bitten by a rat in one of those rooms,\" he recalls.  \"The other dormitories were too expensive for anyone but the Gold Coast denizens to live in,\" he adds.</span></p> <p><span>One of those \"Gold Coast denizens\" found his professional career in a theater on Holyoke St. Harold Adamson came to the College with no idea that he wanted to be a lyricist until he wrote the book for Hasty Pudding and Pi Eta Club shows.  \"When I did the first Pudding show we had a professional from New York doing the choreography, and he said I was good enough for Broadway so I went,\" Adamson says.  He went on to write for Ziegfeld shows in New York, and was later voted to the Songwriters' Hall of Fame.</span></p> <p><span>When Franklin Delano Roosevelt, then governor of New York, delivered the 1930 Commencement address to his son James and the rest of the graduating class, he may not have realized the effects his later actions as president would have on the political ideas of the group entering \"the company of educated men and women.\"</span></p> <p><span>His New Deal, which most members of the Class of '30 alternately describe as 'a handout\" and \"a giveaway program\" helped codify many of their ideas about the economy.  \"It's not only Carter but the whole socialist giveaway, welfare state, with its endless social programs and wasteful spending, begun under Roosevelt and propagandized by those like J.K. Galbraith and other college professors who accept good salaries and hope for tenure and long vacations, as well as sabbatical leaves, and yet so hypocritically criticize capitalism that provides this largesse for them,\" Gordon B. Worcester writes to his class.  But Elliot, a lobbyist, emerges with an opposite view, \"I reached the never-to-be-reversed conviction that Uncle Sam's taxing authority utilized to balance our economy by curtailing greed and dishonesty and developing social benefits and policies...was the only means which could effectively reverse the Depression and permanently carry forward the just, honest economy we ought to enjoy so as to maintain full employment.\"</span></p> <p><span>Just as the Depression may have been their first experience with the power of economics beyond its favor with business and law school admissions officers, for some World War II provided a dramatic reminder of the responsibilities of the international stature of the United States in the late 30's.</span></p> <p><span>One engineer writes, \"In the war, I learned that five years infantry experience in a southern military school, and two years with A's in Mil. Sci. had no value; but I received a commission in the Air Force based on business experience.\"</span></p> <p><span>Barbour was stationed in Bulgaria when war was declared.  \"There was less of it at the beginning, in 1930, and diplomacy was acquiring opprobrium as a striped pants gentlemanly occupation.  However, clouds were gathering, clouds which carried the lightning of upheaval, and which still persist today, with different manifestations but with the fundamental ingredient of increasing Soviet power.\"</span></p> <p><span>What did you do in the war, Daddy?  \"My toughest fight was with my draft board.  Sent to England, I spent the first six months in base and convalescent hospitals,\" Blaikie reports.  From their various war offices and combat units, the Class of '30 returned home to another term of FDR, many deploring the necessity of war but convinced of the importance of military preparedness.</span></p> <p><span>\"Only the United States, the most powerful nation in the world, can make the Kremlin pause and think.  Not by military tactics, but by the power of its will and preparedness to stop the imbalance, made manifest at all times, and including the inherent threat to employ the military if essential, to continue our existence and that of our equally determined allies,\" Barbour writes.</span></p> <p><span>John C. Gray '30, now a physicist, connects world-wide aggression with the predominance of sexism in most cultures.  \"Whatever advantages existed once for the traditional roles assigned males and females, the world is now too small and populated, too interdependent, and supplied with terrible weapons, to continue male macho dominance,\" he writes.</span></p> <p><span>Richard G. Tinnerholm, a corporate vice president, sees the need for more sweeping reform.

Larry Loper, of Sugar Land, Texas, contributed the following to one discussion of the relative merits of 45s vs 9 mm ammunition.  \"Let's try an experiment,\" Loper suggests.  \"Lie flat on your back on a bench or table.  Have a friend--or enemy--take a baseball bat and slam it into your gut with all the force he can.  Your skin remains unbroken and there is no wound.  Yet you are rolling on the floor, puking, due to energy transmitted via hydrostasis and body reaction.  A good hollowpoint does the same thing.  IT drills a hole in the body, then gives it s good kick in the gut.\"</span></p> <p><span>The lead article--no less than the third in a three-part series--concerns illegal aliens in the Southwest.

Foreign espionage agents also enjoy the freedom of our turnstile border...New Mexico is officially bilingual...  'A low regard for life is part of Mexican culture, so when an illegal comes north, that culture usually travels with him'...  'The country is being overwhelmed, with no effort being made to stop it.  But I think a change in the national attitude could correct it.\"</span></p> <p><span><i>Soldier of Fortune</i> bulges with advertising, most of it aimed at the high-priced professional \"adventurer.\"  There are lots of advertisement for books, on every topic from how \"to build a submachine gun in your home workshop,\" to \"a revealing look at fantastically effective sniping techniques,\" the latter complete with a chapter on \"Sniper Employment.\"  Maybe you need German Paratrooper Boots?  Or a knife called the Dwarf (\"the bastard of the mating of wormeaten wood with twisted steel.\")  Or perhaps you are \"ready for the fun and excitement of the M-19 A\" submachine gun?  All are available in the <i>Soldier of Fortune</i> market place.</span></p> <p><span>Lest you fear <i>Soldier of Fortune</i> is too macho for your perusal, rest assured the magazine has something for everyone.  As an example, there is Bill Carpenter's informative treatise on \"Guns for Gals.\"  Carpenter begin his accout with the story of a woman who heard a noise at the door and called the police, only to be told that because of budgetary problems it would take some time to answer the call.</span></p> <p><span>\"When the police finallyarrive, you probably know nothing of it, because you are raped, kidnapped, dead or beaten badly.  Sounds frightening, doesn't it?\"  It certainly does, but Carpenter has the solution--guns.  Because \"in many cases the man of the house must be away from home due to work etc,\" women need firearms.  Big firearms, because smaller ones \"lack the stopping power to bring down an advancing felon.\"  Carpenter admits his advice may be legally questionable.  \"Some states have ridiculous laws, such as one can shoot in self-defense only if the intruder states he intends physicals harm\" But fire away anyway, he recommends pithily.</span></p> <p><span>\"I would much rather be tried by 12 of my peers than have six of them as pallbearers.\"</span></p> <p><span><i>EASY RIDERS</i>--Entertainment for Adult Bikers, monthly, $1.75, published by Paisana Publications.</span></p> <p><span><i>Easyriders</i> is an up-front magazine.  As the editor says in his introduction to an interview with David Duke, the  Grand Wizard of the KKK, \"Anyone who has read us for any period of time knows that we're up-front about  everything and believe absolutely in freedom on the press.  At times we present controversial articles, knowing full well we may catch some flack from someone, somewhere--and we welcome it.  We firmly believe in presenting both sides of any issue, and so we will certainly print rebuttals to the following up-front interview.\"</span></p> <p><span>Earl Warren couldn't have said it better; in the name of the First Amendment, Duke discloses, among other things that \"white people face massive discrimination in employment opportunities, in scholarship opportunities in school, in promotions in industry, in college entrance admittance....  We prefer things that are white.  We prefer the white race in terms of physical beauty, we prefer the white race in terms of our heritage and culture.  We prefer our lifestyle to that of blacks and non-whites around the world...the discrimination whites are experiencing today is far more massive than what blacks experienced in the past.\"</span></p> <p><span>Up front means more than politics though.  <i>Easyriders</i> is honest about every controversial topic--sex, 130 mph motorized tricycles, farting and even death.  A member of the staff, Ken Stambaugh, was killed in a motorcycle accident a few days before publication, and <i>Easyriders'</i> lead columnist, Spider, eulogized him in this fashion:  \"I didn't get to know the man--he'd just been with us a few weeks.  He was working on his S.U. carb on the shoulder of the road near our firetrap the other night when a broad in a cage went off the road, smackin' him and his sled, shovin' 'em a hundred feet down the road.  It makes you wonder why these things happen.\"</span></p> <p><span>Letters fill large chunks of Easy Riders.  A true classic, reprinted here in its entirely, came from Pete Chambly, Quebec, Canada:  \"I'm typing this letter because I can't write for shit.\"  A testimony on behalf of children comes from \"The Widow,\" a native of Salisbury, Md.  \"This is to all you outlaws who think rugrats are a hassle.  Kids are the only way to keep our lives free!  We've got to teach our babies about love and brotherhood.  We've got to make them proud to be scooter people.\"</span></p> <p><span>The only letter signed with a real name comes from W.K. Coors, of Golden, Colo.--\"Word has reached me that an unfounded rumor that the Adolph Coors Company, or members of the Coors family, have contributed money or support to national gun control legislation continues to be spread.  I wish to inform everyone that neither myself nor my company has made any contribution of this kind.

Another passage from the magazine's James Reston, Spider:  \"I'm about to pay my taxes, folks, so I'll strap another one on ya.

Colorfully.</span></p> <p><span>Color is a commandment taken literally by the seasoned corps of hardnosed reporters that hold high the Henry Luce standard.  The June 16 issue, for example, includes in its lead story the following information:  Ted Kennedy travelled in a \"long, black Lincoln Continental\" wearing a \"diplomat's dark blue suit.\"  He made his decision to stay in the presidential race \"after several hours of discussion with a break for sandwiches.</span></p> <p><span>An accompanying piece about the president's Republican rivals catches Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford \"stroll(ing) out of their meeting near the 13th hole of the Thunderbird Country Club in Palm Springs...\"  Ford, always a clothes horse, was \"smiling and relaxed in a blue blazer and beige slacks,\"  A story on ghetto problems discusses a \"black former newpaper publisher in a gray pinstripe suit.\"  The \"People\" section of this weekly reveals that when Idi Amin walks down the strets of Saudi Arabia \"he wears the shapeless white <i>thobe</i> gown and <i>ghutra</i> headcloth.\"</span></p> <p><span>Beyond their prismatic gift for tint and shading the editors of Time have a real talent for discovering anguish.  the illustrating example abounds--a teaser for the cover story on \"Help--Teachers Can't Teach\" tells of one teacher who \"suffered a literal case of 'teacher burnout.\"  Returning from lunch one day, he found flames leaping from his classroom window.\"  Another mother despairs, \"How do you tell your chid that contrary to what the teacher says, pin and pen are not homonyms?\"  But virtue lives on in some corners.  One teacher \"scrubs the desks in her classroom herself and sweeps the floors three times each day.  Says she:  'Kids sense the order, and they like it.  They behave differently in a clean classroom.\"</span></p> <p><span><i>Time</i> delights in the story behind the story.  Maddened by a putdown from Joan Kennedy but under orders not to respond, \"Rosalynn Cater's anger vibrated through the White House corridors\" only to show up on the Time Inc.  seismograph.  And the talent for summation almost overwhelms.  When voters told pollsters that they wouldn't support Jimmy Carter in November, \"their mood was captured by Roy Brown, a food company executive in Fort Lee, N.J., who declared:  'We need a change.  anything would be better than four more years of Jimmy Carter.\"</span></p> <p><span>Each week, the last page of the magazine features the \"Time Essay.\"  This week, Frank Trippett used the space to discuss \"The Human Need to Break Records.\"  Pointing to gigantic games of musical chairs and quick consumption of jalapeno peppers a proof, Trippett concludes,\"Only humans striving for more than mere survival have elaborated competitiveness into the cultural imperative that it is .  The obsession with setting records is finally inextricable from the human determination to rise above the past.\"  Consider, in closing, another Trippett observation, \"The act of dying,\" he says, \"is one of the very few human activities that do not stir up competitive fever among people.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "Resist Registration | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>D</b>RAFT REGISTRATION is now an unhappy reality; the choice for 19- and 20-year-olds is no longer how to oppose passage of the law.  Instead, young people now face a personal choice--whether to register.</span></p> <p><span>We urge those called upon to register to refuse, and to refuse loudly.  The arguments against registration are sound--it is militarily foolish, coercive, and motivated in large part by President Carter's re-election campaign.  Registration now will trim by only a handful of days the time it takes to induct Americans--on that ground alone even former Calif. Gov. Ronald Reagan opposes the plan.  As a sign of \"national solidarity\" in the wake of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, draft registration is a part of Carter's dangerously confrontational stance of reviving the cold war.  And as a part of the Carter \"doctrine\" of military intervention in the Persian Gulf, draft registration represents Carter's failure to enact a sound program of energy independence.</span></p> <p><span>Young people opposed to registration have not avoided their responsibility to dissent within the system.  Hundreds of thousands have demonstrated legally.  Others have lobbied on Capitol Hill, or written letters to Washington.</span></p> <p><span>Now, when their voices have been ignored by older men intent on personal political gain and committed to a reactionary and senseless foreign policy, young people must continue the fight.  Those who refuse to register should publicly explain their reasons, to local newspapers, to their friends, parents and Congressmen, and to local registration boards.</span></p> <p><span>Registration is more than a personal problem--it is an integral part of burgeoning American militarism and a device that will make intervention in other nation's affairs more easy and likely, psychologically if not practically.  Resisting registration becomes, on one level, a way of saying no to a system that places spending for military accumulation above spending for human needs, and of opposing a government that feels it has \"no reason to apologize\" for the damage it has done to the people of other nations.</span></p> <p><span><b>R</b>EFUSING REGISTRATION is not a light decision--currently the law exacts a penalty of up to five years in prison and $10,000 in fines for resisters.  And if registration takes place over the summer, as seems likely, it will be hard for many young people to find the support they may need to make a hard choice and live with its consequences.  Many will label resisters selfish, but the charge loses its sting in the light of the political selfishness that brought registration back.  Those who resist a policy at high personal cost because they find it immoral and unwise are courageous next to those who legislate the fate of others for the sake of their own gain.</span></p> <p><span>There is another probable cost to resistance.  The societal upheaval that widespread and active opposition could produce is not something to be discounted.  But it appears now that nothing short of it will suffice to change the minds of those who run the country.  Furthermore, a climate of resistance to one abuse of contemporary society may bring to the surface needed discussion of other problems facing the country.  A mass display of civil disobedience would offer America much hope along with its turmoil.</span></p> <p><span>Many will argue that registration is only a first step that there is little need to resist until some civil servant starts pulling draft numbers out of a hat.  Those who oppose the draft must continue political efforts to stop its adoption, but resisting once a draft goes into effect may come too late.  It is time now to warn the nation that we do not plan to be used as tools in one man's political campaign or as cannon fodder in a war that can claim no moral justification.  If the unhappy day comes when a necessary and moral battle needs to be fought, we will volunteer.  For today, we say resist.</span></p>"}

These are movies about jes' plain folk who might live around the corner or across the state, silly stories of ordinary people who want to be rich so that they can be happy, happy in the American way.</span></p> <p><span>Strangely enough, it is this slapdash indictment of the American system that differentiates these first \"summer\" films of the eighties from movies of other summers.  Neither of these films has a political consciousness to speak of, and both are only mildly--and spottily--entertaining.  But each takes a stab at the American capitalist system and the Protestant ethic of hard work and honesty.  And in each film, the American way of life takes a beating, handily defeated by chicanery, theft and vice.</span></p> <p><span>Jane Curtin, Jessica Lange and Susan St. James play three women down to their last nickels and thyme in High Cost of Living, each eager to drop the bad script life has tossed them, all of them desperate for money.  They decide to rob a shopping mall.  Curtin, with her wing-nut mouth, bolting eyebrows and thunderous thighs has the biggest role.  While she never slips into Mrs. Loopner, or any other of her <b><i>Saturday</i></b> Night <b><i>Live</i></b> characters, Curtin is not as successful on the silver screen as she has been on the tube.</span></p> <p><span>This is largely true of Lange and St. James as well and might be attributed to the earnest but flat script.  While Lange purrs as beautifully as a Persian cat and St. James creates a perfect suburban mother, the trio never manages to build the kind of fast-talking, silly camraderie maintained even by Charlie's Angels.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>High Cost of Living</i></b> has no value, of course, on a practical level but director Scheerer cannot be accused of not trying.  Except for the outlandishness of the robbery plot, his portrait of three middle-aged middle-class women in Eugene, Oregon is devastatingly accurate.  Their adventures with the police, with gas station attendants, exhusbands, husbands, and little leaguers have the all too humid air of authenticity about them.</span></p> <p><span>The very choice of a shopping mall as the target of their heist attempt makes an air-conditioned, claustrophobic comment about the American middle-class.  Never mind that if these women sold off even half their wardrobes, they could drive gas-guzzling American cars for years--the cost of living is not only expensive, it is high.  And part of that high cost is the material drain of today's values.  Curtin, Lange and St. James each play women who would have no trouble voting for Ronald Reagan in November if there were to be a sequel called, say, <b><i>How to Make American Great Again.</i></b>  But they are also citizens who, unless reminded, would not vote at all.  With its stumbling but accurate portrait of America caught in the throes of a mid-life crisis, this bubbly comedy provides more chills than laughs.</span></p> <p><span><b>U</b>SED CARS attempts a similar brand of semi-political humor where all the \"statements\" are cheap shots at American institutions, including Jimmy Carter.  It stars Kurt Russell, the notorious Elvis impersonator, as a stupendous used car salesman anxious to make the grade as a U.S. Senator.  Young Kurt is positive that with enough fast-talking, and with his charming good looks, he can fool all of the people all of the time, despite his plaid sport jackets and polyester slacks.</span></p> <p><span>This knee-slapper details the rivalry between two used-car-selling brothers (both played by Jack Warden) and the shenanigans they perpetrate to dominate the used car market in this small Southern California town.  Due--understandably if you've seen How to Beat the High Cost of Living--to a slow economy, business is bad in both lots, which face off across a strip of pavement that serves as a demilitarized zone.  Soon these good ol'boys are playing at war, and their tactics become increasingly destructive.</span></p> <p><span>Whatever political comment Used Cars aims to make (and there is a hilarious moment involving a presidential address), it gets lost in the car race that consumes the second half of the film.  All of it is tongue-in-cheek, silly with a hint of satire but the slam-bang plot turns the movie into a predictable demolition derby.</span></p> <p><span>Only one line stands out.  As Russell leads a caravan of 250 used cars across the California desert, he realizes that he'll never make his deadline if he sticks to the speed limit.

{"title": "GO Politics | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>D</b>ETROIT--Curious how the unwavering mood of most Republicans gathered for the national convention in the Motor City is unswerving conservatism.  Sensing a coast-to-coast crystallization of right-wing thought, GOP delegates seek to ride the tide to the Oval Office. While the rarified atmosphere of a convention can blur vision, it appears that today's smart money is on Ronald Reagan to win the presidential sweepstakes.</span></p> <p><span>With Reagan entrenched as the party's nominee, the Republicans' rightist elements are eagerly seizing control of the party.  To a large extent, as scrutiny of the platform developed last week reveals, they already have.  But they have achieved this newfound surpremacy at the expense of party moderates, who have been shunted rudely aside.</span></p> <p><span>Republican moderates, in the minority here, have responded in kind; they have rallied behind the former California governor, stretching their principles in the name of party unity.  Of course, all Republicans still have one overriding goal in common--ousting President Carter from power.  Toward that end, the party is determined to stage a play without drama here, to write a story with a  predictable ending.  It has succeeded thus far.</span></p> <p><span>If Reagan prevails in November, he will have forged an unlikely coalition, adding disaffected Democrats and Independents deterred from voting for John Anderson and Carter, to the conservative elements he has long represented.  Reagan's personal characteristics, his seeming steady hand and gleaming image, make such a partnership viable.</span></p> <p><span>It should come as no surprise to liberal Democrats that the country has waxed conservative.  Citizens see an America held hostage in Iran, helpless in Afghanistan, held in disrespect by Allies and hated by enemies.  They have less money to make ends meet, see big government as a convenient target for contempt, and want a tax cut as an expedient remedy.  The country seems less prosperous, less in control.</span></p> <p><span>Playing and preying on the insecurity of individuals, the GOP seeks to capitalize on Carter's numerous mistakes and broken promises.  But in riding the crest of this wave to Washington, the Republicans risk swamping America's future.  These are the politics of reaction, short-term quick-fixes made all the more attractive by a bumbling president who has himself sought to react to Patrick Cadell's latest survey.  As Sen. Robert J. Dole (R-Kan.) said this week, \"We couldn't have done it without Jimmy Carter.\"</span></p> <p><span>Instead of preparing measured, judicious responses to Carter's gaffes the GOP has proved content the last two weeks to go with the Big Mo.  It has allowed the ultra-conservative elements to exert influence disproportionate to their support among the electorate.  Former president Gerald R. Ford was introduced by a film whose soundtrack featured the melancholy ode \"What I Did for Love.\"  In his speech, he insisted he was not an elder statesman; he pledged that he would be active in campaigning to defeat Carter while failing to mention whether he would try to move the party back to a more responsible, centrist position.</span></p> <p><span>For Reagan truly to represent the country in the office of the presidency, he must straddle some issues.  If he is elected on the basis of his present stances--the ones enunciated repeatedly here, strikingly in the realm of economic policy and anti-Soviet policy--he may wind up tied to programs that would severely hinder any sort of progress toward resolving long-term dilemmas.  Of course, much of the rhetoric spouted this week is bluster, and the delegate selection process tends naturally to send loyal hardliners as representatives to a convention.  But beneath the bluster must be some indication that Reagan will govern effectively if elected, with an eye cocked to the wishes and interests of all Americans.  And some signs that the moderate viewpoint will not be overlooked.</span></p> <p><span>In its attempt to organize a tightly-organized convention, the GOP has projected an image of unity behind the banner of conservatism.  By dint of the overwhelming majority of right-wingers gathered, the Republicans have demonstrated a remarkable intolerance for differing perspectives.  By systematic suppression of dissent, the party is unwittingly undermining rather than reinforcing the precepts of democracy.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>O FURTHER THE COMMON CAUSE of reoccuping the White House, the GOP was willing to put its differences of four years ago behind it.  The nearly consummated Reagan-Ford marriage would have provided the Republicans with an imposing, if not unbeatable, team.  While several observers Wednesday night wondered whether the drawn-out back room bargaining was evidence of Reagan's indecision, others speculated the excitement-- like everything else here--may have been deliberately staged in the former California governor's finest dramatic tradition.  Reagan's eventual withdrawal of concessions to Ford, while perhaps in the best interest of the presidential office, again represented a refusal to deal with moderate Republican forces.</span></p> <p><span>Even the choice of George Bush, merely one in a long parade of former Reagan adversaries who chose not to disagree with the GOP's candidate or its platform this week, should not prove significant. A second choice, Bush will probably parrot Reagan rhetoric since his positions during his own campaign were no less simplistic than Reagan's.  Bush, too, will be drenched in the \"populist\" flood of conservatism.</span></p> <p><span>If this is the path to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave, then the road must be perilously paved.  If moderates must resort to strident speeches to appease the party, then the party may push itself too far right to appease the nation.  If party homogeneity is necessary to subvert the tyranny of manifold conflicting interest groups, then the political process needs a doctor.</span></p> <p><span>Is the opinion of GOP moderates anathema to conservatives?  In an atmosphere of reaction, tacitly strengthened by public sentiment, it is.  And as the moderates--who pose the greatest threat to rigid conservatism--are co-opted by this convention, the country's future dims.  Amid the anti-Carter rhetoric that can carry the November election, there must be some strands of reason, some sign that conservatives are not uncompromising.  This week in Detroit, there have been no such indications.  Maybe that's why conservatives sport smiles wide than Carter's 1976 grin.  The roots of the slogan, \"Together--A New Beginning,\" are found not in optimism, however, but in intolerance--a profound cynicism about anything classified as non-conservative.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Grinding the Ax | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>F</b>LABBY, OTIOSE, AND even worse, whimsical:  labels that might be affixed to an economy increasingly mired in lassitude, beset by the twin problems of inflation and recession.  As if those dual difficulties were not sufficient to twist minds from Washington to Cambridge, the latest productivity figures show an alarmingly small rise--indicating that the most jaded and chronic criticisms may in fact be borne out.  It's crisis time, and the crescent encompasses a region less foreign than the Near East.</span></p> <p><span>In an effort to subvert dire suspicions of economic collapse, the Republicans have put their best hooves forward on the Senate floor, lurching from tax cut proposal to tax cut proposal.  Usurping the populist initiative by adopting a stance historically reserved as a presidential re-election panacea, the GOP in the name of its soon-to-be coronated nominee Ronald Reagan has stolen some traditional Democratic thunder.  President Carter last week called the proposal \"irresponsible,\" adding that it would prove the first step in a plan that could cost the Federal Treasury $280 billion a year by 1985.</span></p> <p><span>Against the incumbent's stern, presidential warnings of a tax cut, the Republicans have rushed to fill what they term a \"leadership vacuum,\" and appear anxious to spank Carter in public on the basis of the president's past economic flip-flops.  Sen. Robert Dole (R-Kan.), himself a defeated candidate for both president and vice president, spoke out this weekend as the ranking Republican on the finance committee.  \"Those who are irresponsible in a time of crisis, including economic crisis, are those who cannot and will not act,\" Dole said in a sharp rejoinder to Carter's accusations of earlier in the week.  He added, a touch snidely, that Reagan and the GOP \"have filled the leadership void in Washington.\"</span></p> <p><span>Carter's criticism of the GOP proposal stems from his projection that adoption of the original 10-per-cent, across-the-board individual tax cut plan (businesses would be allowed to deduct new investment on income taxes more quickly) would lead to an eventual three-year 30-per-cent total reduction--a measure supported by many Republicans in the house.  The more drastic slash would also adjust rates for inflation annually.  Carter himself has said he would review possible tax cut legislation after election heat has subsided, vowing that he would not be tempted by the potential vote-getting power of a reduction in taxes.  After all, the call for a tax cut has long been heard from certain senate Republican circles, Dole offering a prime example.  And the Kemp-Roth proposal for balancing the budget, which includes a massive tax cut, has been the object of flirtation for many politicos.  Martin Feldstein, professor of Economics, has characterized the Kemp-Roth proposal as something \"politicians can digest in thirty seconds and discuss for months.\"</span></p> <p><span>This clamor for a tax cut is probably, to use Carter-speak, \"irresponsible.\"  But given the depth of the current slump, and the fact that the economy faces a substantial tax increase next year-- in the form of social security payments, windfall profits payments and the effect of higher tax brackets caused by inflation--it seems reasonable to try the limited tax slash plan recently defeated in the House.  As higher production costs and increasing uncertainty continue to stunt incentive in the industrial sector, it may prove necessary to counter the recessionary trend with some sort of tax cut.</span></p> <p><span>Even liberal Sen. Paul E. Tsongas (D-Mass.) suggested last week in a <i>New York Times</i> op-edpiece that tax cuts to businessmen before individuals may be in the best long-term interests of the country.  The premise of individual tax cuts--that consumers would use additional disposable income as the savings needed to stem inflation--is a flimsy one at best.  External factors such as snowballing oil, food and medical costs point to consumer behavior that entails running as fast as possible to stay in the same place--that is, spending.  Republicans respond to such criticism by denying any paternalistic intent, claiming people know what to do with their money.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE BEST REMEDY for an ailing economy might be a stiff tax on oil--similar to the one extolled by presidential candidate Rep. John B. Anderson (R Ill.) and Harvard Business School professor Daniel Yergin--coupled with a social security tax cut for individuals and investment tax credits for business so that depreciation schedules might be used to better advantage.  The gas tax acts as a disincentive to profligate oil consumption, while the additional disposable income afforded by a reduction in the regressive social security tax allows consumers the type of choice that supply-side economists and Republicans say has been slighted by big government.  Reaganites, in an attempt to upstage a stumbling president, have inadvertently found themselves championing the cause of the man on the street, the little business on the block.</span></p> <p><span>However specious that claim may seem to students of history, it does not behoove the Democrats in an eelection year to grin and bear stunted growth and unrelenting unemployment. Carter, whose foreign policy pronouncements have left even the most attentive listeners wondering what he really means, has yet to define what he calls \"responsible\" behavior at home.  He should lead by example instead of watching public opinion polls and reflecting the mood of the moment.  And though his hesitancy to impose a tax cut marks a departure from his habit of appeasing the pollsters, it's ironic that he may be missing his best opportunity to give the economy a dose of good medicine.</span></p>"}

I'd prefer migraines.\"</span></p> <p><span>Feigned or not, Queen's illness and subsequent release will make him rich.  He has signed to write a book for Doubleday and will be technical adviser for the upcoming motion picture <i>Man From Tehran.</i>  That picture will star Marlon Brando as Col. Charles Beckwith with Omar Sharif as the deposed shah of Iran.</span></p> <p><span>In addition, Queen's presence in Geneva will make it easy for him to open a Swiss Bank Account for funds derived from the impoundment of Iranian holdings in the U.S.  As the first American released, Queen will have his pick of oil wells in Texas, coal mines in Wyoming, or a deluxe embassy mission in Washington.</span></p> <p><span>\"Ham Jordan won the White House betting pool with his guess of May 4,\" Born disclosed, adding Jordan came closest without going over the actual date of the release of the first hostage.  \"Carter had $10 on April 1,\" he confided.</span></p> <p><span>\"Predictions were limited to dates before November 4.  \"Any hostage release after then was deemed useless,\" Born continued, dispelling the rumor that Jordan planned to keep his winnings to himself.  \"There's no question that Ham will split the pot with Richard Queen.  After all, Queen did the time for this caper.\"</span></p> <p><span>Other <i>Hostage</i> cast members expressed polite envy over Queen's new wealth.  \"What can you say?\"  asks Howard Staggart, a professional hostage who was held at Entebbe and the B'nai Brith offices in Washington.  \"This is a tough business.  It demands long hours of punishing work and it can be very boring.  It's not as glamorous as people think.  But success is possible and Dick Queen's an example.  I only wish I had gotten the break.\"</span></p> <p><span>Analysts and theater critics agree that Queen's release indicates Iranian production values may be changing.  \"I think we're seeing a new, softer Khomeini,\" says Walter Mutt of <i>The New York Times.</i>  \"He's still living in a glass house, but he's getting other people to throw his stones.\"</span></p> <p><span>The future of Mission Innoculation depends on the proper diagnosis of American illnesses--and the CIA's strength at smuggling bacteria into Tehran.  \"We're working on a new strain of dysentery,\" agent Frank Snepp reported cheerfully.  \"It's called Ayatollah's Revenge.\"</span></p>"}

President Carter's official pronouncement giving priority to attacking military targets in the Soviet Union rather than cities and industrial complexes.</span></p> <p><span>Samuel P. Huntington, Thomson professor of Government and director of the Center for International Affairs (CFIA) said yesterday the recent directive marks the \"culmination\" of ten years of research and evolution, adding that the shift in official strategy allows for a \"measured, moderate response.\"</span></p> <p><span>Huntington, who has served as security coordinator for the National Security Council during the Carter administration, said the revised policy would increase capability to hit large military targets.</span></p> <p><span>\"We have not had a proper capability for a limited response.  The directive will permit us to substantially increase intelligence satellites and command and controls.\"  Huntington said, adding that the decision was the outcome of a detailed three-year study and did not represent a political reelection ploy.</span></p> <p><span>But George B. Kistiakowsky, Lawrence Professor of Chemistry Emeritus and an expert on nuclear weapons, yesterday called the shift in policy \"stupid and juvenile,\" saying, \"the whole business of emphasizing counterforce weapons is an extremely dangerous move that accelerates the possibility of nuclear war.\"</span></p> <p><span>Because the policy will cause \"frightful instability in case of a general political crisis,\" Kistiakowsky said, it will create an atmosphere where leaders might \"jump the gun.\"</span></p> <p><span>Kistiakowsky said Secretary of Defense Harold Brown is a \"very weak individual, unable to resist pressure from his surroundings,\" and accused Carter of \"licking the ass of the right wing\" in an effort to \"play election politics.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>Rhetoric</b></span></p> <p><span>Derek Leebaert, a research fellow at the CFIA and manging editor of \"In- ternational Security,\" said the new directive signified a change in rhetoric rather than substance.</span></p> <p><span>\"All along, there's been a disjunction between actual planning and what responsible officials have been saying,\" Leebaert said, adding, \"The announcement was timed to coincide with the Republicans' emphasis on superiority.\"</span></p> <p><span>Huntington also acknowledged that planning had moved toward capability of destroying military targets, even during the '60s when the language of \"Mutual Assured Destruction\" predominated.

They issued a memo when they returned:  <i>\"To all Convention Staff:</i>  The Republicans made very good use of the colors red, white and blue.  Please consider using these wherever appropriate.\"</span></p> <p><span>It's going to be that kind of convention, a four-day affair that could kill all chances for a show of party unity; a 96-hour extravaganza of political divisiveness that may rupture the party permanently; 5760 minutes of protests by communists and socialists and angry constituents that could become unwieldy and even violent.</span></p> <p><span>Bill Dixon, a tall, sandy-haired Carter man who ran the president's Wisconsin campaign four years ago, now sits atop the convention throne.  It's his party and the way things are going, it looks like he'll be running short of chopped liver, cole slaw and drink mixers long before the networks sign off from their play-by-play coverage of \"Convention '80.\"</span></p> <p><span>Dixon keeps a low profile.  He grants few interviews and maintains a calm facade.  He still contends the convention will be a success.  But what is success?  An open convention?  Jimmy Carter nominated?  Ted Kennedy hushed?  Red, white and blue bunting?</span></p> <p><span>The Kennedy threat is real among workers here at headquarters.  A couple of weeks ago, when Kennedy threatened to file 30 minority reports, rumors spread that the convention would last five days instead of the regularly-scheduled four.  Dixon ordered credentials to be printed for the extra day.  Even after a Carter-Kennedy peace accord, the convention will last long hours.  The right speakers may not appear during prime time.</span></p> <p><span>More importantly, the Democrats simply will reinforce their current image of disunity and disorganization.  The pall of the Carter Administration will extend to the darkest corners of the beer stands in Madison Square Garden:  Liberty, Justice and Incompetence for all.  The president, who hopes to mend fences with Kennedy when the campaign ends, may find it difficult even to shake hands with Ted at the convention podium.</span></p> <p><span>A look at the convention volunteers reveals the depth of the Party's problems.  Most of these grass roots workers do not support Carter.  High school and college students eager to learn something about politics and have a good time at it; many openly support the more glamorous candidates:  Kennedy or Anderson.  Some prepare to vote for Barry Commoner.  An open convention would suit them fine.  Sending Carter back to Plains would be even better.</span></p> <p><span><b>C</b>ARTER has his supporters, of course.  Patronage appointees are not quick to shoot their goose.  Many of them still rave about the president's performance in drawled Southern accents.  The Georgia Mafia--with members from all over the country--has taken over and will be difficult to dislodge.</span></p> <p><span>But the appointees remain scared.  They worry that their volunteer staff will turn openly against them when the convention starts.  To prevent the possibility of being outshouted on the convention floor, the Carter people are closely monitoring the distribution of convention credentials.  Four years ago, any volunteer who wanted to attend the convention received credentials.  This year, with the incumbent's share of supporters and news coverage, volunteers get ignored easily.  No one even knows who's going to get credentials.</span></p> <p><span>And the Carter people are scared of the protesters, who have filled a list with scheduled protests and plan even more, spilling through the streets of New York and into Central Park.  If it sounds anything like Chicago in '68, the description is accurate.  The New York police are using films from the late Mayor Daley's fiasco for training.</span></p> <p><span>At convention headquarters, the volunteers remain quiet.  Deprived of substantial responsibility by their appointed bosses, they secretly hope for an open convention but keep their opinions secret.  Menial tasks take on increase importance.  They talk about convention buses and hotel reservations.  When conversation turns to Carter versus Kennedy politics, it's far easier to talk about how many credentials are being printed.  Or about which colors will look best on the convention floor.</span></p>"}

{"title": "A Better Idea | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>L</b>AST WEEK'S negotiations between representatives of Ronald Reagan and former President Gerald R. Ford to create a so-called Republican dream ticket--with Walter Cronkite as unofficial mediator--have generated volumes of information on the minute-by-minute intricacies of the process.  <i>The New York Times, The Washington Post</i> and <i>The Boston Globe</i> all printed similar accounts of what happened, and <i>The Chicago Sun-Times</i> had a version all its own:  \"It's Reagan--and Ford,\" the front-page headline declared.</span></p> <p><span>Midwestern aberrations aside, all those reports told us pretty much the same thing:  Ford would have liked the number-two spot, but only if Reagan had promised to give the former chief executive everything except his first-born son (giving Ford his second son, would-be Nureyev Ron Jr., was always a part of the deal); when Reagan refused to sign over his soul, the dream faded.</span></p> <p><span>But that is not the whole story, according to some highly placed sources who may or may not be reliable.  It seems that Ford lost interest in being the Republicans' second banana (in title, anyway) after he received another offer--from President Carter.</span></p> <p><span>Apparently Carter and wife Rosalynn were watching the Republican convention Wednesday night during all the hullabaloo about Ford.  Shortly after CBS's Dan Rather announced knowingly that the deal had been struck, the notion of a different dream ticket entered Carter's mind.  The president immediately picked up a phone and ordered the operator to get him Jerry Ford at the Detroit Plaza Hotel.  \"I'm going to get him first,\" Carter told his wife.</span></p> <p><span>\"Don't you think it might be embarrassing to have Ford as your vice president, Jimmy?  I mean, he's clumsy, his wife Betsy used to drink alcohol and take mind-altering drugs, and his children are always getting themselves in a heap of trouble.  Besides that, Jimmy, he's one of <i>them.</i>\"</span></p> <p><span>\"One of what?\"  Carter asked.</span></p> <p><span>\"A northerner.\"</span></p> <p><span>As Rosalynn shuddered at the word, the phone rang.  Carter picked it up and said, \"Hello, Mr. Former President.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Who's this?\"  mumbled Ford.</span></p> <p><span>\"This is Jimmy Carter.  We met a few times back in 1976.  I'm calling tonight to ask you to be my running mate, Mr. Former President.\"</span></p> <p><span>Ford chuckled.  \"Well, you know, my wife Betty always tells me I should run, but I think it's kind of boring--swimming's for me.  So I think you ought to get someone else.  I hear that this George Bush runs a lot.  Try him.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Mr. Former President, let me try to make myself clearer.  I think it's a shame for someone of your experience and expertise to sit around like some kind of elder statesman just acting wise, and so--\"</span></p> <p><span>Ford interrupted.  \"That's right.  I've never been one to sit around.

Are you one of those Reagan people?\"  Ford bellowed.  \"Betty, someone else is asking me to be the vice president.\"</span></p> <p><span>In the background, Carter could hear the former first lady say, \"Maybe it's Walter Cronkite again, dear.\"</span></p> <p><span>Exasperated, the president yelled into the phone, \"This is Jimmy Carter.  The president!\"</span></p> <p><span>Ford turned to Betty again and said, \"He says he's the president.\"</span></p> <p><span>Carter heard Mrs. Ford laugh.  \"Well, you know Walter.  Things have gone to his head.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HIS IS NOT Walter Cronkite,\" the president insisted.  \"It's President Carter.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Betty, he says he's President Carter.

You know, the one who thought Poland wasn't free,\" Mrs. Ford answered.</span></p> <p><span>\"Oh, now I remember,\" Ford said, speaking into the phone.  \"Hello, it's nice to hear from you again.  What can I do for you?\"</span></p> <p><span>The president repeated, \"I want you to be my vice president, Mr. Former President.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Well, why didn't you say so.  As you know, I have been negotiating with other prominent individuals--are you a prominent individual?\"</span></p> <p><span>\"In a way,\" Carter responded.</span></p> <p><span>\"Good, then I'll make the same proposal to you I've made to the others.  I get to make all cabinet appointments and ambassadorial selections.  The entire White House staff will report to me.  I am entitled to half of all gifts foreign officials give you, and I get to play in the White House elevator any time I want.\"</span></p> <p><span>Carter pondered for a minute.  \"The part about the elevator is a little much, don't you think?\"</span></p> <p><span>\"All right,\" Ford conceded.  \"But I have dibs on the toaster oven in the upstairs kitchen.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Sounds good,\" Carter said.  \"Just one thing--what will I do?\"</span></p> <p><span>\"That's right,\" Ford answered, \"just one thing--light the Christmas tree.  Come to think of it, though, I always enjoyed lighting the Christmas tree.  You can decorate it.\"</span></p> <p><span>Carter responded furiously.  \"That's going too far, Mr. Former President.  Amy loves lighting that tree, and I'm not going to agree to anything that'll take that thrill away from her.  The deal's off.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Anything you say, Walter.  But if you change your mind, give me a call.\"</span></p> <p><span>Carter hung up the phone.  \"What'd he say, Jimmy?\"  Rosalynn asked.</span></p> <p><span>\"He wanted to light the Christmas tree.

{"title": "The Great Crusade | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>A</b> WOMAN sporting what had become a familiar \"Reagan-Bush\" button wandered up and down the aisles before the plane departing Detroit for Boston was ready to take off.  Left behind were the glimmering towers of the Motor City's Renaissance Center, the \"good\" parties, the four days of unceasing rhetoric and unbridled optimism.</span></p> <p><span>Infused with the spirit of the 32nd Republican convention, the woman spotted a passenger in the smoking section who had lit a cigarette before the \"No Smoking\" sign had been turned off.  Perhaps inspired by vice presidential nominee George Bush's reference to \"a great mission,\" or perhaps inspired by presidential nominee Ronald Reagan's call for a \"renewal of the American compact,\" the woman swiftly and officiously told a flight attendant of the smoker's trespass against his neighbors.</span></p> <p><span>As the attendant duly reprimanded the premature smoker, the woman's eyes shone, a self-satisfied smile wrinkling her face.  Ahead was the great crusade, and it had only just begun.</span></p> <p><span><b>E</b>VEN THE MANY professional journalists in Joe Louis Arena Thursday night were somewhat stirred by the staged celebration of the Reagan-Bush ticket.  Media types stood up on the specially-constructed wooden tables as the convention hall shook with paroxysms of Republican passion, watching the masses dancing and the two nominees waving.  While none of the journalists cheered--they are, after all, paid to be objective or at least, discerning--several were seen to grin, infected by the spirit.</span></p> <p><span>The orchestra launched into \"I've been working on the railroad\" on a number of occasions, presumably because if Reagan gets elected, the trains will run on time.  But for the GOP to have such a united convention last week, there must have been a unifying factor, one thing that caused ultra-conservatives like Jesse Helms and moderates like George Bush and Henry Kissinger to abandon their \"principles.\"  That factor was the person of Ronald Reagan, a sincere, likeable, even comforting figure.  Wherever he appeared, he conveyed a personal air of respectability and pleasantness.</span></p> <p><span>In his acceptance speech, Reagan derided President Carter's \"Trust <i>me</i>\" style of government, the implication being that he, Reagan, does not need any more trust than he already has.  Instead of resorting to the rousing rhetoric of others who addressed the convention, Reagan delivered his speech in a calm, reserved tone, the implication being that he, Reagan, could impassion his audience without overwhelming oratory; he directed the style of his speech at the cameras, knowing from his showbiz experience that subtlety of gesture is more expressive than exaggeration.  Furthermore, he used Franklin D. Roosevelt '04 in his address, implying that he, Reagan, was above partisan labels.  And he concluded by asking America to bow its head in prayer--the implication being that he, Reagan, had not developed an overweening sense of vanity through the week of excessive praise and a schedule designed to make his victory more coronation than nomination.</span></p> <p><span>Beware, America:  Ronald Reagan's great crusade is coming to your town this fall, and he wants you.  And he'll get many of you.  His broad appeal can be broken down into three theories:</span></p> <p><span>1. Reagan as refounder:  As classically expressed in Machiavelli's <i>Discourses,</i> every Republic needs a reconstruction every once in a while.  By invoking a renewal of the American compact, and a \"New Beginning,\" Reagan is merely offering a smooth solution to the woes that beset the country.  Don't trust me, Reagan says, trust the country.  Simplistic but powerfully attractive.</span></p> <p><span>2. Reagan as surrogate parent:  Here comes Ronald Reagan, speaking softly but brandishing the big stick.  He is Big Daddy come to rescue his wayward children, and will not hesitate if necessary to spank the Soviet boys on the bloc.  He projects a Freudian father image, comforting in times of confidence crises and national malaises.</span></p> <p><span>3. Reagan as actor:  Some might say Reagan as reactor is more accurate, but supporters claim he will restore that community of shared values, that pioneer spirit, that thrill of victory so evident in his many films.  Family, work, neighborhood, peace and freedom:  the stuff from which good, sappy, Hollywood films are made.  Reagan as president would simply have the lead role, and he would \"show\" the international arena a thing or two.</span></p> <p><span>Yes, Reagan's manner and style reassure, and he symbolizes hope in a time of despair.  But his form is not connected with his substantive stands on the crucial issues facing the country, any more than the iresponsible GOP platform that emerged from Detroit last week.</span></p> <p><span>His strong stand against government waste has a certain intuitive appeal, based on the popular notion that our government controls our everyday lives.  But there are no assurances he will be able to isolate the inefficiency, and to keep his pledge, he might purge valuable social programs.  His stands on abortion and the equal rights amendment smack of regress--a renewal of some of the less fortuitous features of the \"American compact.\"  His palatable personality alone is not sufficient to dispel legitimate fears about his warped social priorities.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>N THE FIELD of economic policy, Reagan would loose the shackles of the oil companies in an effort to lessen dependence on foreign oil.  While this might prove a partially effective short-term solution, it does not bode well for the U.S. 20 years from now, when depleted supplies--no matter how vigorous the exploration--will send shock waves through an economy even more deeply mired in crude.  His dismissal of conservation as secondary shows that Reagan has little prescience, little desire even to consider the long-term.  Increased emphasis on coal--also a finite resource, and the cause of acid rain to boot--and on nuclear energy (which has proved remarkably cost-inefficient, apocalyptic scenarios aside) show an unwillingness or inability to get a grip on the future destiny Reagan begs us to \"recapture.\"</span></p> <p><span>While selective tax cuts to stimulate growth and offset inflation would probably provide a needed dose of medicine to an ailing economy, Reagan's support of the Kemp-Roth plan, coupled with burgeoning defense spending, would severely irritate the inflationary spiral.  And Reagan's preoccupation with \"the growing menace from the East\" in foreign affairs, together with his stated preference for superiority, shows a man burdened by a desire to return to the past, whose \"new beginning\" will have the same old ending.</span></p> <p><span>In their quest to seize the White House, the crusading Republicans last week forgot their differences.  Bush didn't \"want to be nickel-and-dimed to death by details\" lest he be forced to remember his principles; Henry Kissinger suddenly forgot about detente and linkage and all those things he so slyly sculpted while Secretary of State; even Bush-haters from Texas and North Carolina reserved their judgement until after the election.</span></p> <p><span>Environmentalists, women, drivers, moderates and premature smokers beware:  Ronald Reagan is coming to your town, equipped with the big Mo, the big stick and the big compact.  This is one show that may not have a happy ending.</span></p>"}

One has to go back to the Eisenhower era to find a president whose siblings kept their shenanigans in the shade.  And even Ike's brother Edgar, a highbrow industrialist from Tacoma, Washington, liked to get in his digs at his brother the president.  \"Edgar's been criticizing me since I was five,\" Ike once joked at a press conference.</span></p> <p><span>But the Eisenhower brothers kept their political disagreements largely to themselves.  And, nepotism be damned, Ike drew his youngest brother Milton, a university president (Johns Hopkins) and long-time civil servant into his inner circle.  Milton gave Ike important advice on his direct telephone line to the White House, and made the 40-minute drive to Washington from his home in Baltimore several times a week.  It was Milton who encouraged Ike to accept the Republican nomination in 1952, and it was Milton who said he should seek a second term in 1956.  He also advised Ike's 1953 atoms-for-peace proposal, consulted on foreign economic policy and education, and served as a presidential emissary to Latin America.</span></p> <p><span>No one smiled cynically when Ike introduced his kid brother as \"a man of whom I've always been proud to say:  'My brother Milton'.\"  Jack Kennedy maintained an even closer relationship with his brother Bobby, and, though the two had fiercely clashing personalities, they got on famously.  Familial embarrassment was noticeably absent at Camelot, despite the rumors of swimming pool orgies and Mafia links that crept through the tight Kennedy ring of privacy.</span></p> <p><span>But when Lyndon Johnson inherited the Oval Office late in 1963, he brought with him Sam Houston Johnson, a sharp-witted drunk with a predilection for the fast life.  \"I guess Lyndon wanted me close by so that he could keep a big-brotherly eye on all my extra-curricular activities,\" Sam wrote in his 1969 book, <i>My Brother Lyndon.</i></span></p> <p><span>\"He had never approved of my fancy apartment or my having a valet at the age of 23.  And since he still wore baggy, ready-made suits from Sears, Roebuck, my custom-made clothes also offended his sense of prudent frugality.\"</span></p> <p><span>Sam behaved more like Lyndon's prize Airedale than his brother.  He lived in the White House with the president and Lady Bird, before, between and after his two marriages, both of which ended in divorce.  Lyndon, who used to turn out the lights in Sam's bedroom to save electricity, sincerely worried about Sam's carousing and would wait for him to come home, then chew him out for drinking too much.</span></p> <p><span>The president also derided Sam's sense of hunor.  Shortly after Kennedy's assassination, with the country still in mourning and life in Washington finally veering toward normal, Lyndon went out of his way to pay a call on his brother.</span></p> <p><span>\"Sam Houston,\" he said, \"I wouldn't be here if it hadn't been for you.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Lyndon,\" responded Sam, trying to be funny, \"I had nothing to do with Oswald.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Goddamnit, Sam!\"  yelled Lyndon.  \"What the hell kind of remark is that?\"  The president hung up only after giving his brother a 20-minute tongue-lashing.</span></p> <p><span><b>F.</b> DONALD NIXON never got close enough to his presidential brother to enjoy the sweet abuse of a tongue-lashing, although once when the Nixon brothers were younger, Dick \"lit into me and gave me a dressing down I'll never forget,\" recalls Don.  \"He aired all of his gripes of the past two or three years.\"</span></p> <p><span>But as Dick Nixon the grocery clerk became Richard Nixon the politician, the gripes became political sore points.  The beefy, \"affable if sometimes bumptious\" Don with the trademark ski-jump nose was a businessman of questionable ethics, apparently a family affliction.  In the 1950s, he cashed in on his brother's vice-presidential status by opening Nixon's, a California fast-food chain that featured \"Nixonburgers.\"  When the chain developed a few weak links, Howard Hughes selflessly donated $205,000 to the cause, a loan that Don never repaid (a loan not unlike Colonel Khadaffi's contribution to Billy Carter's coffers).</span></p> <p><span>The Hughes loan made for bad press during Richard Nixon's 1960 presidential campaign, and the candidate made repeated efforts to curb brother Don's financial gamesmanship.  For his part, Don tried to avoid publicity.  \"They call me 'Big Don,'\" he once said.  \"I'm larger than Richard.  I'm not a public figure--I'm just a fellow trying to make a living.  I don't want to be in the limelight at all.\"</span></p> <p><span>But Richard wanted to insure that Don stayed out of the headlines, especially once he became president.  He arranged a job for his younger brother at the Marriott Corporation, where Don's last name worked such magic that one competitor grumbled, \"I don't know if he's got 'vice president' or 'brother' on his business card.\"</span></p> <p><span>In 1973, word leaked out that Big Brother had been wiretapping Don's phone for more than a year.  The White House called it a security measure, but nobody believed that for a minute.  Dick was simply protecting his blind side.  At the same time, Don revealed that the president even refused to talk to him:  \"John Mitchell is a man that I was delegated--they designated that I should talk to him about any matter pertaining to--in other words, <i>I never talk to my brother about anything</i> and John Mitchell was the man I was assigned to.\"  Nixon had stonewalled his brother.</span></p> <p><span><b>J</b>IMMY CARTER still talks to Billy.  \"I admire the way he lives his own life,\" the president once said of his brother, who is 13 years his junior.  \"I have never had any occasion to be embarrassed by Billy.  Billy is a good man and I'm proud he's my brother.\"  Jimmy was proud of Bert Lance, too.  Chimed in Rosalynn:  \"Billy is one of the best people I've ever known.\"</span></p> <p><span>And despite the fact that he is prejudiced, that he wouldn't want his daughters to marry a Black, a hippie, backpacker or women's libber, people seem to like Billy wherever he goes, even Libya.  His income several years ago reached nearly $500,000, more than half coming from the speaking invitations ($5,000 a shot) that he gets, he acknowledges, because he is the president's brother.  Even Jimmy once joked at an L.A. fund-raiser, \"I was hoping that you would raise enough money to have my brother Billy come out and speak next year.\"</span></p> <p><span>Still, the two brothers keep their distance.  \"Jimmy don't comment on my statements and I don't comment on his,\" insists Billy.  \"You can read everything I've ever said and you won't find a political comment anywhere.  Not a serious one, anyway.\"  Even so, what if Jimmy asks him to cool it?  \"That's the easiest question I'll ever answer,\" says Billy deliberately.  \"He's never going to call up and tell me to change.\"  Never?  \"Jimmy's staff may bitch but...to hell with his damn staff.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "Lou Rawls, Pfc. | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>L</b>OU RAWLS is going to go to war and the rest of of will stay at home.  \"Let me give it to you straight,\" the multi-tonal diplomat told America's youth in a widely circulated series of \"public service\" ads.  \"Register--not because it's the law...cause it's the right thing to do.\"</span></p> <p><span>So most American young men are registering.  And the demonstrations are small.  People realize the necessity of preparedness, of showing a united, unwavering visage to the vulture across the sea.  Not only that, the economy is healthy.  In real life, on the steps of the Lexington Post Office, young men are bullshit.  Not just the young men who go to Harvard and spend their free time complaining about American imperialism but the kind of young men who work in gas stations, not DNA labs, over the summer.</span></p> <p><span>Those of us who decided to spend these two weeks talking to people as they came to register for the draft feared at first that we might catch a lot of flak.  But the super-patriots are gone; yeah, one or two guys made meant-to-be-overheard remarks about the \"faggots\" or \"communists.\"  But almost everybody wanted to stop and talk, and almost none of them were happy.</span></p> <p><span>The general consensus was that registration makes no sense.  \"I pay taxes every year; they know where I am,\" one explained.  \"Seven days--if its the kind of war where seven days is going to make a difference, then ten minutes isn't going to make a difference,\" another said.  And people, praise God, are turning pleasantly cynical.  They realize that if there is registration without a war, there must be a reason, and it's probably one that doesn't make much sense.  \"I guess this is Jimmy Carter Re-Election Headquarters,\" one 1978 graduate of Lexington High School said, and the inflection was bitter.</span></p> <p><span>Part of the reasoning is straightforward save-my-ass selfishness:  \"I figured something like this would happen so I took a course and became a minister of the Universal Light Church Inc,\" one said.  Others talked--seriously--of going to Canada, of going underground, of becoming conscientious objectors should the draft resume.  But the personal motives mask a core of political beliefs.  Americans may have forgotten about Vietnam, but it doesn't take much to remind them, and draft registration brings memories back to the surface.  Exxon and Mobil will be distressed to learn that large numbers of America's youth think oil isn't worth dying for.  \"What the fuck have they ever done for me?\"  asked one, obviously not a regular reader of the <i>Times</i> op-ed page.</span></p> <p><span>There <i>are</i> circumstances that will move Americans to fight--the most common is a fear of Soviet expansion, the spread of Russian communism through military force.  \"Something has to be done to stop them\" was a common refrain all week--when asked, many said they would be willing to go to war should Russia show signs of overrunning the free world.  But, bumper stickers to the contrary, young men seem to realize that there are two sides to the Iran \"crisis\" that is supposed to rescue America from the passive \"Vietnam Syndrome.\"  None of them seemed eager to go to war over the hostages.</span></p> <p><span><b>O</b>NE THING causes most men to register:  the fear of prosecution, the thought that not signing the goddamn card may mean five years in jail.  On the steps of the post office several guys wondered how many hadn't registered.  They asked how the court rulings of the last two weeks would affect the chances of successful prosecution.  They questioned what a felony conviction would do to one's career prospects.  \"What's going to happen if I don't?\"  they asked, again and again.</span></p> <p><span>And of course, there were no answers to reassure them.  The mathematics indicate widespread jailings are unlikely; 10 per cent of the total registrant pool is 400,000 people, ten times the total population of America's federal penitentiaries.  And there are obvious difficulties with convicting young men of violating a law that they knew at least to be of dubious constitutionality.  But who knows?  The punishment may be severe--a semester at Danbury, Conn., not UMass.  Many young men turned around and said they will wait another week to make up their minds, time to see how many aren't registering.  Others registered but scrawled \"under protest\" on the cards.  Still others said they would resist only once the draft begins.</span></p> <p><span>The system, whatever it is, seems corrupt when fear of prosecution motivates action.  Presumably, most Americans refrain from murdering each other not because they don't want to go to jail but because they don't believe in murder.  People don't sit in front of banks and say \"well, if we can get 5 per cent of the population to stick up cashiers the district attorney will have a hell of a time trying to prosecute us.\"  Young men understand that society will proceed just fine without registration; only their lives, entrusted to the government, may not continue normally.</span></p> <p><span>But if everyone is so opposed to registration, how did it ever get adopted?  The answer is that <i>everyone</i> is not so opposed to draft registration.  Congressmen, by virtue of Article III of the United States Constitution, are over 25; to them, it sounds like a fine idea.  And to most of the population, not scratched deeply enough by the prospect of registration to make them remember, it doesn't sound so bad.  But to the people affected, young men and their parents, and young women smart enough to realize it won't be so long until, registration is an immensely larger issue.</span></p> <p><span>The perennial concern--should a majority with a slight interest outweigh a minority with a large interest--can be solved here very easily.  If young men are going to fight wars, give them some voice in deciding which wars are worth fighting.  Let them \"vote with their feet\" by deciding when the situation merits volunteering for military duty.  The record indicates this would protect America--in the first five days after Pearl Harbor, 15 million people signed up.  The informal range of opinions sampled on the steps of the Lexington Post Office, however, indicates it might not protect the oil companies.</span></p> <p><span>America must realize the depth of cynicism among her youth.  We have serious doubts about the reasons for the actions of our leaders.  And those doubts raise a more serious question:  how long can a government remain trusted, beloved, when it relies on power, not reason, to enforce its dictates?  In a way, Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), Jimmy Carter and the rest should be thanked--draft registration will wake up another generation, start them wondering about our world.  And who's to blame if the answers they arrive at don't jibe with administration policy?</span></p> <p><span>One guy came down to the post office after he'd seen the commercials on TV and he talked for a while.  In a sack in the bowels of the Lexington post office, there's a card which reveals that Lou Rawls, vacationing in Lexington, registered for the draft.</span></p>"}

{"title": "The Same Old Mistakes | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>P</b>RESIDENT CARTER's decision to send an anti-terrorist commando group to free the hostages forcibly--his decision to invade Iran--climaxes a policy that has wilfully ignored American history in Iran and pandered to the worst emotions of the American public in an election year.  To be sure, the mission was badly conceived and badly executed, even on a technical military level.  If the helicopter <i>had</i> landed successfully in the desert, what would the soldiers have done in confronting a sprawling embassy compound in which the hostages are widely dispersed, and guarded by 150 armed Iranian militants?  Harold Brown will not tell; we can only speculate that the plan involved a considerable amount of bloodshed, and that the <i>safe</i> return of the hostages was no more than tentative.  Moreover, the operation can only further confuse our European allies, who just recently agreed to aid an American posture of restraint, and were not consulted till after the fact.</span></p> <p><span>But the issue is not one of technique; this was not merely a \"mistake,\" a \"blunder,\" a \"screw-up.\"  The use of military force was unjustified and wrong.  It was wrong because President Carter acted as he has always acted, with an ear to the polls and feeling the sting of a defeat in the Pennsylvania primary.  It was wrong because eight American soldiers died in an unnecessary military action.  It was wrong because it was conducted in complete secrecy, in defiance of the spirit of a democratic society, as embodied in the War Powers Act of 1973.</span></p> <p><span>Mostly, it was wrong because American actions in Iran were guided, as they have always been, by an exceedingly narrow national interest dominated by what President Eisenhower used to call \"the military-industrial complex,\" represented in this case by the major oil companies.  The projected use of force was totally inappropriate because another option remains open:  an admission of past evils and a repudiation of the Shah.  Carter stands on international law--but where was international law in 1953, when a CIA-engineered coup put the Shah in power?  What are the rights of the hostages to the rights of Iranians that were systematically, maliciously trampled on during the Shah's tenure, so much so that Amnesty International branded the Shah the world's worst offender of human rights?  Force is only justified when nothing else will do; force will not be justified until America has redeemed its history.</span></p> <p><span>Carter refuses to be honest with the Iranians, and honest to the American people, who remain ignorant not only of the details of this operation, but largely of America's complicity in the Shah's dictatorship.  Guns can win votes--Gerald Ford's popularity skyrocketed after the Mayaguez incident, and John Kennedy's did also after the Bay of Pigs.  But guns will not get the hostages back; they will not make America the friend of the nations that now invade our embassies; they will not make for a moral and honest foreign policy.  And that is the real national interest of America.</span></p>"}

Tricaptain \"T\" Lenze again broke his school record in the hammer throw, set two weeks ago, with a toss of 212 ft. 4 in.

{"title": "Born-Again Populism | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>At a hotel across the street from Cleveland's oldest and most prestigious businessman's club, the Citizens' Party Founding Convention last month launched a political movement aimed at eliminating the economic inequality they see symbolized by that club.</span></p> <p><span>The Citizens' Party may become the strongest challenge to the two-party system from the left since the brief challenge of the Populist Party in the 1890's.  In fact, author Studs Terkel convened the gathering on a Friday night by saying, \"We are all born-again Populists.\"  Much of the rhetoric that weekend recalled the Populists' fight against turn-of-the-century monopoly capitalism.  But what really united the 262 delegates gathered to create a new political alternative was a shared belief that the existing political parties are no longer addressing the issues of most concern to Americans.</span></p> <p><span>Terkel summed up this feeling in his denunciation of the \"Republocrat\" party he sees dominating contemporary politics.  Barry Commoner, the environmentalist-turned-political-activist who received the near unanimous endorsement of the delgates as presidential candidate, put it more plainly when he accepted his nomination:  \"We are the people who are going to help our fellow Americans smile when they go into the voting booth, instead of holding their nose.\"</span></p> <p><span>That ambitious statement, greeted by boisterous cheering, climaxed the effort Commoner, Terkel and about 100 others began last August to bring the Citizens' Party into existence.  In eight months of hurried preparations, those founders managed to create party organizations in 33 states, and put Commoner on the ballot in four of those states.</span></p> <p><span>Commoner himself only recently came on to the political scene, though he has been an activist throughout his career.  He is probably best known as an environmentalist and energy expert, through the several bestsellers he has authored:  \"The Closing Circle,\" \"The Poverty of Power,\" and his most recent book, \"The Politics of Energy.\"</span></p> <p><span>He is a Columbia graduate with a Biology Ph.D. from Harvard in 1941, and he currently directs the Center for the Biology of Natural Systems at Washington University in St. Louis, an environmental research facility.  A deceptively energetic 62 year-old.  Commoner has been calling for radical changes (including reorganization of the energy industry along socialist lines) for many years now.  In founding the Citizens' Party, Commoner hopes to create a vehicle for implementing some of those changes.</span></p> <p><span>Delegates at Cleveland represented a wide cross-section of backgrounds and motives for being there, including left-leaning democrats, new-left radicals from the 1960's (Mario Savio, founder of the Free Speech Movement at Berkeley--the group which kicked off student protests in the '60's--was there, with graying hair and beard), radical teminists, American Indians, gays, and Gray Panthers.</span></p> <p><span>Ideas were just as diverse--delegates held political and economic views ranging from socialist to the American ethic of agriculture and small business.  Although it has not yet had a serious effect on the party, an underlying ideological split exists between party members who favor a return to the days of small-scale capitalism and those who favor a socialist industrial state.</span></p> <p><span>This split manifested itself in the most spirited debate of the convention, over the economic plank of the party platform.  A delegate from Ohio rose to denounce the plank, formulated by Sidney Lens, a well-known socialist author calling it simply a \"wish list\" and describing it as \"old fashioned socialism.\"  Lens vigorously rebutted these charges, thrusting the meeting into a flurry of accusations and counter-accusations of intellectual dogmatism and shortsightedness.</span></p> <p><span>\"The Citizens' Party will not engage in politics-by-label--damning a proposal just because someone has called it 'socialist,'\" Lens said.  In the end, the convention voted overwhelmingly to adopt his plank, which included calls for the nationalization of certain key industries.</span></p> <p><span>Other features of the platform, which must be ratified by the membership at large in a mail ballot, call for a guaranteed job for everyone who wants to work, a more even distribution of income, cutbacks in military spending, an end to nuclear power, and increased implementation of affirmative action programs.</span></p> <p><span>Party members admit the platform is unabashedly idealistic and do not claim to have all the answer.  In the debate over, the economic plank, Lens said, \"It someone asks me how we plan to go about nationalizing these industries.  I'll say I frankly don't know.  We don't know <i>how</i> to do it, but we do know that it's <i>necessary</i> that we do it.\"</span></p> <p><span>Not surprisingly, Commoner's ideas are quite influential within the party; its collective vision of the ideal society strongly reflects his ideas of a new society built around a radically restructured energy system.  Commoner is a tireless advocate of solar energy as the answer to America's problems, and his analyses show how a conversion to solar energy could solve economic problems as well as the \"energy crisis\"--which he sees as the result of a system based on profits instead of the national interest.</span></p> <p><span>The profit system is Commoner's most frequent target, along with the giant corporations which he believes dominate critical decision-making.  \"All the problems of this country can be traced to the fact that decisions vital to the national interest are made by corporations who are interested only in maximizing profits,\" he claims, adding, \"They don't give a hoot about the national interest.\"</span></p> <p><span>Commoner (and the great majority of the party members at Cleveland) favor some degree of social control over the means of production.  He cites the words of a businessman speaking about the steel industry (which most likely will be unable to meet domestic demand by 1985) that you just can't expect a corporation to produce something just because the country needs it--as a rationale for social governance.</span></p> <p><span>\"Democratic control of productive decisions will be the main political issue of the 1980's,\" Commoner predicts, \"And the two major parties won't even touch it.\"</span></p> <p><span>Commoner expects the Citizens' Party to fill this gap in the political picture.  By providing solutions to the problems caused by our corporate-dominated society, Commoner plans the party will attract a large constituency of those disadvantaged by that same society, seize political power, and restructure the economy.</span></p> <p><span>Commoner is not predicting any political revolutions in 1980, but he does feel that the electoral situation this year is especially suited to a third-part effort.  A delegate from Pennsylvania observed that \"the scandalous no-choice between Carter and Reagan\" cries out for an alternative.  And Commoner is \"the first American of stature to advance himself not as a saviour like Anderson but as the candidate of a party that will last regardless of the election outcome.\"</span></p> <p><span>Commoner does emphasize that the Citizens' Party is not just another one-shot campaign a la Eugene McCarthy; its long goal is to become a majority party.  Commoner uses phrases like \"building a political force\" and \"establishing a presence in American politics.\"</span></p> <p><span>But the party faces serious problems in its quest for legitimacy.  One is a strategic question which caused a major rift at the convention--whether a presidential campaign is the most effective way of establishing a political party with the strong grass roots tendencies of the Citizen's Party.</span></p> <p><span>Commoner, the leader of the presidential faction, maintained at the convention that a national campaign can be an invaluable asset to local organizing, by providing the party with a recognizable national symbol.</span></p> <p><span>The opposing faction did not deny this, but questioned Commoner's commitment to local party-building.  Lucius Walker of Pennsylvania, a major figure in the camp opposed to Commoner's views, said that Commoner would be an ideal national candidate.  \"He's very good on the corporate and macro issues, but not so good on grass roots organizing.\"</span></p> <p><span>But in the end, the split in the party was smoothed over.  The grass roots faction strongly endorsed Commoner's nomination, and Commoner apologized for campaigning against that faction's leaders.  The question that remains is whether the split will surface again during the next few months.</span></p> <p><span>The noticeable absence of organized labor groups at the convention suggests a potential hindrance to the party's growth.  Despite Commoner's favorable attitude towards labor (he called for automobile plants owned and operated by the United Auto Workers (UAW) and work-owned steel plants at the convention), the Citizens' Party has not attracted much support from liberal labor organizations.</span></p> <p><span>Delegates said labor's leanings toward Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) has weakened Citizen's Party appeal to labor support, but are unable to explain this lack of support further.</span></p> <p><span>Some delegates at the convention said that the party will have to convince labor of its legitimacy if it is to gain strength.</span></p> <p><span>John Anderson's campaign as an independent is another issue which the Citizen's Party must confront if it is to succeed, for Anderson and Commoner appeal to many of the same kinds of voters.  Commoner recognizes the odds; Anderson has an unquestionably wealthier and more organized campaign.</span></p> <p><span>Commoner's strategy at the moment attempts to discredit Anderson in the eyes of liberal voters--he goes out of his way to point out Anderson's inconsistencies and the conservatism of his voting record.</span></p> <p><span>\"Anderson is only a pseudo-alternative.  His supposedly liberal positions amount to a warmed-over republicanism,\" says Commoner, although he does grant Anderson credit for legitimizing the idea of an independent candidacy.</span></p> <p><span>\"Anderson claims he's running a campaign of ideas.  Well, I think its very good for a candidate to have ideas, but more important for a candidate to have <i>good</i> ideas.\"</span></p> <p><span>Commoner also has an argument ready for those who would accuse him of being a \"spoiler\" in the presidential race--that is, of drawing votes away from the Democratic party and thus guaranteeing a Reagan win.  Suppose you are a voter concerned about growing militarism in the world, he says.  Suppose you cast your vote for Carter because you have weighed the risks and decided that Carter would be a bit less likely to get America involved in a war.  Well, says Commoner, that may be the case (though he doesn't see that much difference between Carter and Reagan)--but a vote for Carter does not in any way let Carter know that it was a vote cast specifically for peace.  It is a wasted vote because it isn't differentiated from the millions of other votes Carter receives.</span></p> <p><span>A vote for the Citizen's Party, on the other hand, \"would leave no doubt whatsoever in the mind of whoever won eventually that it was most definitely a vote for peace,\" he says.  \"Nor would voting for Anderson be a vote for peace, because Anderson's position will have no meaning after the election.</span></p> <p><span>If the Citizen's Party does well and establishes a constituency for peace, \"it could even put a chip in Reagan's fascist tendencies.\"</span></p> <p><span>But more immediately, Commoner's campaign faces the more concrete problem of getting his name on the ballot in as many states as possible.</span></p> <p><span>With a win in November an almost certain impossibility, a more realistic goal for the election is five per cent of the popular vote--the level necessary for a party to become eligible for federal election aid funds.  Commoner has said that if the party can reach 80 per cent of the electorate, he believes there is a good chance the Party would capture five per cent.</span></p> <p><span>Federal funds, which could run into millions of dollars, is essential in the process of building a party from scratch.  As it is, the party is scratching for what funds it can get and Commoner plans a major fund drive to stock the party's treasury once the petition drives to get on the ballot end.</span></p> <p><span>Right now, Commoner has successfully met petition deadlines in six states out of eight attempts--and deadlines are fast approaching in many others.</span></p> <p><span>In Massachusetts, the party faces a stiff challenge in meeting the May 5 deadline, Commoner predicts.  With 39,425 signatures required, Massachusetts is among the toughest states for achieving ballot status, Commoners believes, adding that poor organization earlier has left the party in a tough spot.</span></p> <p><span>The petition campaign is in full swing now, and Commoner was in town this week to gather more volunteers to collect signatures.  Wednesday he spoke to about 35 Harvard students at the Eliot House Junior Common Room about the problems of mounting a third party campaign, and asked them to \"sacrifice some time, maybe even a bit of your GPA, to help us provide the alternative Americans want.\"</span></p> <p><span>Commoner is fond of comparing the birth of the Citizen's Party to the beginnings of the Republican Party in the years before the Civil War, on the grounds that its conception emerged from the failure of the two major parties to deal with the fundamental issues of their day.</span></p> <p><span>Commoner, of course, has a vested interest in making an analogy with a successful political departure, but perhaps Studs Terkel's comparison to the Populist era is more appropriate to the contemporary political scene.  Eugene V. Debs, founder of the American Socialist Party, once said during that period, \"I would rather vote for what I want and not get it, than vote for what I don't want and get it.\"</span></p>"}

He refused to go out on the campaign trail, to meet the criticism of his challengers; instead, he discreetly campaigned from the White House, using the telephone before the Iowa caucuses and carefully orchestrated diplomatic initiatives before at least three primaries to boost his support among an electorate hungry for the hostages' return.</span></p> <p><span>All along, Carter's critics charged that his refusal to campaign was merely a political tactic, not a necessity of national security.  This week, the president gave credence to their harshest complaints.  In deciding to give up the protection of the Rose Garden for the glaring publicity of the last few primaries, Carter claims, curiously, that after the fiasco of his failed rescue attempt this week, the crisis is \"more manageable.\"</span></p> <p><span>The crisis is at least as volatile today as it had been for the months during which Carter hid from the American people.  It is Carter's own political future that has suddenly become less manageable--as inflation continues unabated and the nation's economy slides towards the worst recession in almost a decade, the slings and arrows of Carter's opponents are beginning to penetrate his rose-colored armor.</span></p> <p><span>The least Carter can do, now that he has dropped the pretense of perpetual crisis, is to meet his opponents in debate, but it seems that might not be manageable enough.

{"title": "Sexual Politics | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>To the Editors of The Crimson:</b></span></p> <p><span>I was depressed and disgusted by the story by Paul Attanasio sprawled across the May 1st \"What is to Be Done.\"</span></p> <p><span>Over ten years ago, Kate Millett wrote <b>Sexual Politics,</b> starting a protracted personal debate between Norman Mailer and various feminists, and more importantly, reemphasizing the extremely political nature of fiction.</span></p> <p><span>\"Confusing the simply antisocial with the revolutionary, Mailer develops an aesthetic whose chief temperamental characteristic is a malign <b>machismo,</b> still dear to those in the New Left who have fallen under Mailer's spell in adolescence or continue to confuse Che Guevara with the brassy cliche of the Westerns,\" she wrote.  In Mailer's world, \"sex is war, war is sexual,\" and so women are the enemy, to be treated with violence as a solution for male <b>angst.</b></span></p> <p><span>Somehow I had hoped that the reams of feminist criticism of American literary sexism (see Andrea Dworkin's <b>Woman Hating;</b> see my article on Kerouac in the September 1978 <b>Seventh Sister</b>) would knock writers like Mailer off their pedestals, would make younger writers realize that they could criticize an author's male chauvinism while admiring his use of language.  Perhaps this is too much to ask of Harvard, where, as we all know, the pugilist has a private little ring at 21 South Street.</span></p> <p><span>I assume (hope) that Attanasio was satirizing American <b>machismo,</b> making the point that the obsession of his characters with guns and fucks and games was \"why we are in Iran.\"  I appreciate the critique--if it is a critique, and not just an intellectual musing.  The way in which he does it, however, undercuts any positive value it could have.</span></p> <p><span>First of all, it is highly offensive.  \"Sometimes I slip it between those honeydew melons.\"  <b>Think</b> for a minute about what it is like to be a woman in America (after all, just a <b>tad</b> of being a writer is empathy, right?)--getting ass-grabbed on the way to the Coop for typing paper, every goddam man on the street slobbering for those \"honeydow melons\" and letting you know it, whether you're dressed like Radcliffe '80 or Radcliffe '08--caged in by glossy magazine photos of surrogates for you spread-eagled--sitting at dining-hall tables while fellow students boast of Combat Zone conquests.  <b>Think</b> ok?  The crowning indignity is when this trash occurs in your own home, when Quincy House shows porno flicks and when you cannot open the <b>Crimson</b> without being subjected to someone's gang rape fantasies:  \"they could take her together, there were orifices enough for all in the land of plenty.\"</span></p> <p><span>We don't need it.  There's enough of that trash elsewhere that it does not need to be included in a supposedly anti-sexist newspaper.  I don't care <b>what</b> point it's making:  it can be made in other ways.  Because it reads like Attanasio enjoyed writing that.</span></p> <p><span>Secondly--and this is why no justification of such scenes as \"artistically necessary\" is possible--the entire conception and style of the story is inadequate to the issues involved.  Attanasio is glib, his characters are glib.  Everyone is very glib and clever and no real commitment to dealing with the problems of American <b>machismo</b> and militarism is made.  The characters are intellectual enough (graduate students at Harvard, dropping allusions to Heidegger and Hemingway!)  that only intellectuals will read the story; yet they are redneckedly outlandish enough (bowling and slinging semi-automatic weapons) that they will not challenge any intellectuals to consider their own personal role in the process.  Their very redneckedness is in fact romanticized, made \"Hip\" in the way Millett wrote.  In short, Attanasio has created a clever (tiresome) string of one-liners that laughs its way all around the issues.  It's caricature that thinks it's analysis.</span></p> <p><span>And it's a very, very easy way out.  It doesn't try to find a response to redneck <b>machismo;</b> nor does it try to find one to intellectual <b>machismo.</b>  It doesn't acknowledge the real and pressing question of how intellectuals are supposed to stem the tidal wave of jingoism Carter is engulfing us in.</span></p> <p><span>It is an example of decadence--decay of values--in which the only proposed action is laughing at oneself.  Noam Chomsky has written about precisely this, the failure of the American intelligentsia profits-before-people policies, willfully blind and/or intimidated.</span></p> <p><span>It is very simple for young writers to emphasize style in a way that excludes social content.  It is very simple for them to copy the slick New York Establishment--Mailer, Updike, Barthelme, Adler, and so on.  I am not advocating a reductionist \"socialist realism.\"  <b>I am</b> advocating a transcending of solipsistic subjectivity.  <b>I am</b> advocating a thoughtful search for a style that will encourage understanding of the political choices that face us daily.  So, as a literary critic, I find Attanasio's piece unoriginal, everly self-conscious, slick.</span></p> <p><span>And as a feminist, I find it appalling.  I find it even more appalling that a supposedly \"anti-sexist\" paper would include it.  This can indicate only a lack of serious thought into what constitutes women's opression in our country, and how it manifests itself in many forms, including \"literature.\"  Well, start thinking.  Politics is more than two columns of editorials twice a week.</span></p> <p><span>I furthermore welcome debate on a \"new fiction\" that will go beyond cynical self-consciousness. <b>Ilana De Bare '80</b></span></p>"}
{"title": "Leaning In | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>O</b>F THE MANY voices whispering in the executive ear today, few convey a true picture of America's current position to the oval office.  Two years in the Kennedy administration convinced Richard Barnet '52, Harvard Law '54, a onetime presidential adviser, that the president received too little input from people with enough courage to present to him more accurate, if pessimistic, assessments of his policies.  Two decades later, Barnet explores the methods of American leadership and the reasons they fail to cope with the \"politics of scarcity,\" revealing the extent to which manipulation of the world's natural resources influences our lives, in his latest book, <i>The Lean Years.</i></span></p> <p><span>Ricard Barnet came to work in the White House on the day of the Bay of Pigs invasion, and his susequent eye-opening experiences in the State Department provided him with a crash course in the machinery of American foreign policy.  \"I was gradually made aware of the increased involvement of the U.S. in Indochina.  I sensed that there was something wrong with that and that it was being presented in a way that was very different from reality,\" Barnet explained recently from his suite in the Ritz-Carlton overlooking the Boston Common, a way-stop on a promotion tour for his new book.  He had just returned from an appearance on ABC's \"Good Morning America,\" and had sandwiched this interview before two others that afternoon.</span></p> <p><span>\"I was very apolitical during my days at Harvard,\" said Barnet, a History and Literature major.  \"Students couldn't have been more conservative then.\"  He remained unconcerned with public affairs until the day when the Luces, who lived down the corridor from him in the Law School, were arrested and tried as Communist agents for delivering <i>The Daily Worker</i> under students' doors during their undergraduate years at Cornell.  The Luce affair \"convinced me of the irrationality of McCarthyism and the Communist scare,\" he recalled.  While working the next year at Harvard's Russian Research Center on his first book, <i>Who Wants Disarmament?,</i>  he discovered that the State Department had misled the American people to believe it was genuinely working towards disarmament, and that blame for the failure of disarmament lay with the Russians.  In fact, Barnet found, \"it turned out that the Russians made proposal for disarmament in 1955, and the U.S. backed away from them.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>B</b>ARNET'S EARLY disenchantment with the U.S. government followed his disillusionment with the legal profession.  He describes himself at that time as a \"hungry lawyer,\" who published his first book \"out of love of learning and financial need.\"  But, he adds, Harvard came through later, helping him to fund the Institute for Policy Studies, which he founded in 1962.  Barnet started the Institute, he explains, because he perceived a need for an advisory body outside the government which could objectively study public policy.  \"One of the worst problems I became aware of in Kennedy's administration was the pandering for government contracts.  Really great people would say almost anything they thought you wanted to hear to get a contract.  I became convinced that the contract relationship to outside consultants dependent on giving advice to the government was a very bad one on which to depend for getting independent, objective advice.  The reason we were going so fast down the wrong road was that no alternative voices were being heard.  The outsiders, if anything, reinforced what the insiders wanted to hear.\"</span></p> <p><span>In <i>The Lean Years,</i> Barnet writes that the same situation led to Carter's down-the-wire support of the deadweight Shah of Iran in 1978.  In the midst of Tehran riots, the director of the National Foreign Estimate of the CIA, Robert Bowie, appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to give an optimistic report.</span></p> <p><span>\"The intelligence services, as in Vietnam, consistently exaggerated the stability of the regime--and for the same reason.  The 'customers' in Washington did not want to hear that one of the principal pillars of Nixon's 'structure of peace' and a crucial link in America's energy strategy was about to fall.\"</span></p> <p><span><i>The Lean Years,</i> subtitled <i>Politics in the Age of Scarcity,</i> sketches the powerful hierarchies supporting the production and distribution of five world resources:  oil, energy, minerals, food, and water.  Barnet finds that \"the illusion of scarcity creates power,\" and that \"the market operates almost totally on illusion.  It was folk wisdom that the crisis was exaggerated, that the doubling of gasoline prices was making the companies rich, that the companies were in league with the sheiks against the consumer--and it was all true.\"  But--he stresses--there is still a real oil crisis that Americans will not face, which has irreparably weakened the country by enmeshing it in a web of interdependency with foreign regimes like that of Saudi Arabia.</span></p> <p><span>\"In this decade,\" he writes, \"the demand for oil will exceed <i>available</i> supply.  A crisis of industrial civilization may well occur long before global supplies are exhausted or even before the day consumption overtakes production.\"  He sees the key to the oil situation not in the supply, which he believes will last several more decades, but in the control of distribution which the \"Seven Sisters\" of American oil now hold.</span></p> <p><span>American consumption of fully a third of the oil currently produced in the world had forced her to construct foreign policy around oil interests.  Barnet asserts that the oil priority is not new and cites the Marshall plan as an early marriage of American business and political concerns.  The decision to convert Europe from a coal-based energy system to an oil-consumptive one, after the decimation of World War II, is unavoidably tied to oil lobbying.  The world's consumption of oil, inextricably linked with its consumption of minerals, water, food and energy, is managed by a handful of businessmen, much as it was a hundred years ago.  Japan puts pressure for a continued greater supply of oil on Exxon, which puts pressure on the president to reduce its obligations to the domestic market, and he in turn pulls the necessary strings in Washington to allow the company to sell where it can reap the greatest profits.  The American government, Barnet writes, is controlled by businesses to a much greater extent than the public wants to believe.</span></p> <p><span><b>O</b>NE SOLUTION to the nation's problems could lie in dramatic changes in the current form of American democracy.  Barnet suggests that the structure of the government cannot adequately cope with democratic resource planning, and that American's perception of the impact of their participation in government must change:</span></p> <p><span>\"Most elections are votes of confidence or no confidence and have little discernable impact on specific decisions.  For most people in the world their connection to the productive order is tenuous; they can lose their land or their job at a moment's notice.  They live at the mercy of economic and political decisions over which they have no control.\"</span></p> <p><span>Barnet believes Americans have less control over the direction of their country than they realize, and he does not think that they base or are capable of basing their decisions about natural resources on an accurate understanding of world systems.</span></p> <p><span>Even management at the executive level of government may be unable to solve the resource problem within the confines of the American nation-state, much of which Barnet feels is a facade, since neither political party has what he would call a national program.  \"The last three elected presidents have been from the Sun Belt, but they have found the country ungovernable.  None succeeded in carrying through a major domestic energy program,\" he says, and when asked, criticizes the Carter administration for its gross misperception of the energy situation.  \"Carter's inability to handle the energy situation is just one of the failures of his administration,\" he says.</span></p> <p><span>In <i>The Lean Years</i> Barnet constructs a middle ground where the American public and big businesses share blame for the world resource crisis.  As a member of the Institute of Policy Studies, he demonstrates the ability of an outsider from the federal government to present a more cogent and cohesive view of problems than spokesmen for Washington, who have kept the public in a muddle.  His overview may be more pessimistic than most offered to the American public, but the weight of his examination of public policy should serve as a signal to the White House that Americans want, and are capable of developing, a more substantive solution to the problem of managing the world's resources.</span></p>"}

{"title": "From the Sublime to the Ridiculous | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>L</b>AST WEEK, I had dinner with a woman whose daughter is a marvelously talented high school athlete and also carries an impeccable academic record.  The daughter was a red hot prospect in the Ivy League, and she was trying to decide between Harvard and Brown.  Brown was applying the pressure, trying to draw her to Providence.  \"I thought the Brown coach was going to move in with us,\" the mother told me.  \"But the Harvard coach--well, I hardly ever saw her.\"</span></p> <p><span>The daughter decided in favor of Cambridge, for a variety of reasons; but the incident illustrates the sort of attitudinal disparity that currently plagues Ivy League sports, slowly eroding them, especially here, where Harvard struggles to uphold academic ideals in the face of ever-increasing athletic competitiveness.</span></p> <p><span>A careful recollection of Harvard sports, 1976-80, bristles with vivid triumphs; staggers under the weight of expansive change; and, most of all, battles the gloomy veil of disappointment.  This disappointment, in my mind, overwhelms almost all other memories because it seems to be consuming, steadily, the University's sports program.  In effect, this disappointment is a function of the rest of the Harvard athletic program--it follows naturally from the victories and transformations that raise, in both participants and spectators, the hope of progress.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard has, by leaps and bounds, upgraded its athletic program over the last four years.  A dramatic facilities facelift has provided the University with badly needed first-rate homes for swimming, hockey and track.  And the expected renovation of Briggs Cage, which will transform the Cambridge Dustbowl into a sparkling new basketball arena, certainly will give Crimson athletes access to a top-notch athletic complex (assuming, of course, that ancient Harvard Stadium does not crumble in the near future).</span></p> <p><span>Yet this red-brick superstructure shelters a group of student athletes who are caught in the middle of Harvard's inability to decide what to do with itself.  Athletes--and their coaches--have been thrust into the current of a competitive upswing that has been nourished amid the traditional Harvard attitudes of \"sports for everyone,\" \"participation first, winning second,\" and \"brooks before ballgames.\"  The contradiction is an obvious one, though the University seems unable to come to terms with it.</span></p> <p><span>Consequently, Harvard carries an athletic program that attempts to compete successfully on a national level.  It insists on maintaining Division I eligibility in most sports and aims to move up the division ranks in other sports, where fledging Crimson squads are not immediately eligible for top-flight status e.g., women's basketball, which, since 1976, has moved from being a pathetic joke, to the top of Division II in the AIAW, to frustrating inconsistency in Division I).</span></p> <p><span>Obviously, Harvard's rigorous admission standards, lack of a persuasive recruiting program, absence of a physical education or similar \"quasi-academic\" major, and refusal to indulge in many other athletic ego-stroking actions, limits the University's appeal.  Many of the nation's blue-chip prospects, who have athletic tunnel vision and hunger for a high-caliber program, are not going to be attracted by the educational advantages of a Harvard.  Yet inexplicably, Harvard often competes against the very schools that do harbor such hot-shots.  The handicap that Crimson teams must confront in contests is both clear and substantial.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>NTERMITTENT sucesses only provide the architects of such a program with a false sense of progress.  The self-delusion, though, is apparent; take, for example, the case of the men's swim team.</span></p> <p><span>Joe Bernal has built a small dynasty in his new Blodgett Palace, and the aquamen have risen to the top of the Eastern ranks.  This year, when Bernal decided to test the Crimson's prowess against a national power, he brought Indiana to town.  Amazingly, Harvard dumped to Hoosiers, bringing chaos to the national rankings and raising questions about the omnipotence of Harvard swimming.  On the surface, it seemed Harvard had achieved national stature while, ostensibly, maintaining its student-academic standards.</span></p> <p><span>But three weeks later, the falseness of that proposition was driven home:  Harvard did a nose dive in the Nationals.  At its peak, Harvard could up end a national power that was saving something for those Nationals; but that Championship meet showed that, Harvard University, is still a long way from athletic superstardom on a large-scale level.</span></p> <p><span>However, Harvard people are proud, and though they won't openly claim that the school boasts national sports power, they also won't readily humble themselves to admitting that we have a program that just cannot stack up against \"major-leaguing\" sports universities.  And it shouldn't--not if this is going to remain the nation's foremost educational institution.  Unfortunately, very few people can combine top-flight scholarship with superstar capabilities:  most mortals must choose one or the other, making the second choice an avocation, more than a profession.  (In that rare category of scholar-athletes, Harvard draws a fairly good proportion of the people:  but such wonders prove too few and far between to provide the solid groundwork for an outstanding sports program.</span></p> <p><span>The tragedy emerges as the Harvard program drifts toward the mythical status of all-powerful, while athletes in Cambridge are constantly churned up by contradictory forces.  The problem can be seen most clearly in the women's sports program here, which has bounded to great heights in the past four years.</span></p> <p><span>In the midst of Title IX equality gibberish, women's sports got an administrative push, and the women responded.  An influx of coaches; the appearance of amenities such as lockerrooms, uniforms, traveling budgets, and so forth; as well as a gradual effort to attract more high school-trained women athletes, turned around such programs as basketball soccer, lacrosse and swimming.</span></p> <p><span>Most dramatically, the soccer team, after only its second year of varsity status, rose to supremacy in the East--and perhaps the nation--tying for top honors last fall in the regional championship (there is no organized national playoff yet), but improvement has come at a cost--to both women and coaches.</span></p> <p><span>Many of the \"older\" women--juniors and seniors--have found themselves ousted from teams by a new crop of well-trained, specialty athletes--students who have entered with strong high school backgrounds and a desire to exel in a specific sport.  Also, many women who came here believing the sports program would be a somewhat low-pressure athletic opportunity have flinched at the impact of accelerating competitiveness; and many of them, especially the juniors and seniors, have fled interscholastic sports, succumbing to the pressures of trying to practice and study.</span></p> <p><span>Professors demand performance and coaches demand dilligence; and the tug of war, using the student as a rope, has left many onetime athletic enthusiast disenchanted and often bitter.  Also in the middle lie the coaches, trying to drive their teams to greater heights while burdened by their players' classroom demands.</span></p> <p><span>Just how high-powered should a coach be?  That seems to be a central problem.  Paul Moses, a successful women's squash coach who left last year when his contract was not renewed, was a victim of this indecision.  Some of his players complained about his intensity, while others were berating an acquiescence to academic loads.  He could satisfy no one, so he left Harvard--or it left him.  Stephanie Walsh, the women's swim coach who leaves this year after four seasons, has faced many of the same problems.  Speak to any random handful of Harvard women swimmers and you'll get the range of opinions about Walsh:  \"She's too intense,\" or \"she's not serious enough.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE STRAIN OF frustration cannot be obscured.  You can see it in the face of hockey coach Joe Restic, in the manner of hockey coach Bill Cleary, even though the fast-talking optimism of basketball whiz Frank McLaughlin.  Women's hoop coach Carole Kleinfelder has struggled with it, and more students than one could possibly name have to live with it--unhappily--every day of the year.  No one, it seems, has the answer, of how to find sports success at Harvard.  And so team records keep getting worse, the results more discouraging, the attitudes more depressed.</span></p> <p><span>Fortunately, this spring has proved an anomaly--a welcomed reprieve.  Men's baseball and lacrosse have gained playoffberths and the crews have returned to Eastern Sprints domination after a couple of shaky years.  But the rest of the year remains very lean, especially in the beef sports--football, hockey and basketball.</span></p> <p><span>Yes, there have been glimmers along the way:  the 22-7 upset of Yale last November in The Game, a 1977 Beanpot Trophy, last fall's women's soccer title, the 1977 women's hoop Division II title, last year's men's hoop upset of Pennsylvania--those are but a few.</span></p> <p><span>Yet those highlights are almost unwelcomed when they breed a belief that Harvard can rise to infinite heights in sports without a basic philosophical shift.</span></p> <p><span>\"See,\" they say, \"we beat Yale, and they had the No. 1 defense in the nation.\"  Yes, and there could never have been a sweeter moment.  But anyone who suspects such a win foreshadows a move to the ranks of the Big Ten or Pac Eight should submit to therapy.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard University , one can safely predict, will outlast us all.  Without a doubt, it will remain an institutional oddity:  debates about social responsibility, the relationship with Cambridge, the quality of the undergraduate education and the role of sports seem destined to persist perhaps longer than construction on the Red Line.</span></p> <p><span>But the problem of sports at Harvard--not unlike these other woes--hurts people, Harvard people, as it rages on.  There is a great need, in this idealistic academic community, to recognize the drastic limitations an education-oriented school inherently places upon an athletic program.</span></p> <p><span>Though I disagree with much of the rhetoric delivered by Yale President A. Barlet Giamatti, who recently called for the Ivy League to downgrade its recruiting efforts and perhaps abolish playoff competition, I sympathize with the spirit of his remarks.  He urges a realistic recognition of what the Ivy League is about, and that is --most of all-scholarly enterprise.</span></p> <p><span>Giamatti, I think, is rightly disturbed by the escalation of competitiveness at his own school and at many other Ivy schools in recent years.  The surge is invidious; and it fosters such inflammatory accusations as those made about Yale accepting football players with a blatant disregard for their academic records, or Penn doing the same for its basketball dynasty, or Princeton prostituting itself to admit superb women athletes, or Harvard pressuring professors to show some leniency for athletes who perhaps aren't spending all that much time in Lamont or Widener.</span></p> <p><span>True or false, such barbs are damaging, and their increasing frequency damages the reputation of the Ivy League, nurtures smug remarks about how the Ivies have their own little sports scandal.</span></p> <p><span>If Harvard is to serve its students, it will have to take an assertive role in the years to come:  either shrug off the academic ideals and turn to athletic mass production; or step in, stop the win-at-all-cost attitude now taking hold, and restructure the athletics program to a level compatible with Ivy League education.  Right now, rigorous sports programs prevent many athletes form enjoying the numerous benefits of an Ivy education.  It is a tragedy for an athlete to come to Harvard and then never have a chance to soak, up its scholarship because he or she is too busy catching up after endless hours of practice.  The school loses out, the team loses out, and most important, the individual loses out.</span></p> <p><span>A. Bartlet Giamatti is right in calling for the Ivy League to work on this situation together.  If we are indeed a brotherhood of schools and if our teams are to continue to compete primarily with each other, then we should clarify our collective aims an priorities.</span></p> <p><span>As Ivy teams expect more and more that they will have a shot at the golden ring on the national sports merry-go-round, the pressures and the frustration mount.  It is a vicious, self-perpetuating cycle that must be dealt with now, before too many more athletes drift throught the Ivy League--and through Harvard--retaining a bitter aftertaste for college life.  Such disillusion should not be passively endured, especially not in the Ivy League, where you are told to expect Utopia.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE GLORY, that trite \"thrill of victory,\" is indeed rewarding.  but in the Ivy League, and here at Harvard, the cost of such glory has risen dramatically; and, as seems fashionable these days, the price just keeps climbing.  Unfortunately, the Harvard leadership has taken the same type of approach to athletics as Jimmy Carter has taken to the economy:  a sort of wide-eyed, respectfully distressed puzzlement, one that lacks any true definition of action and invites an accompanying rampage of rising costs.</span></p> <p><span>If Harvard is to fight \"victory inflation,\" it will need someone, or a group of someones, to confront the issues.  I hope they have cut deep--stinging members of the Ivy League community.  I know I bristled when I first heard them--my impulse was to berate Giamatti, to endorse the \"I love you, coach; I'd beat my mother for you, coach\" attitude which can pervade athletics.  That attitude just does not work; I suspect it's not very useful anywhere, but especially not in the Ivies or at Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>Athletes have compared a great victory to the grandest of emotions--it's like reaching the top of Mt. Everest or flying over the Grand Canyon.  \"It's sublime,\" they say.  \"You can't describe it.\"  But true to the old cliche, winning in the Ivy League has gone from the sublime to the ridiculous, and it's time we stepped back and realized just how absurd the game we're playing has become.</span></p>"}

She fell in love with a commoner, but her family forbade their marriage.  Then her angry grandfather, the king's brother, accused her of meeting him in a sinful tryst.  The maiden of 19 years was shot to death at her grandfather's orders, and the commoner she loved was decapitated in a public square.</span></p> <p><span>These events formed the basis for a television show which <i>New York Times</i> political columnist Mobil Oil has labeled \"A new fairy tale.\"  But the events are real, and they took place in Saudi Arabia only three years ago.</span></p> <p><span>The Saudi government has strongly protested Monday night's showing of \"Death of a Princess,\" an episode in the Public Broadcast System's Peabody-Award-winning \"World\" series.  While it does not dispute the truth of the story about the princess, the Saudi royal family charges that the program conveys a false picture of Saudi culture.  The fictionalized format of \"docudramas\" may be questionable, but the merits or accuracy of a particular program must never be decided by our government--or by the corporate patrons of public television.</span></p> <p><span>Acting Secretary of State Warren Christopher was wrong to forward Saudi complaints to PBS.  A federal judge recognized his mistake when she ordered the Houston PBS station not to cancel the broadcast, saying that caving in to pressure would amount to political censorship by a state-owned station.</span></p> <p><span>When the same film was televised in Britain last month, the Saudis asked the British to withdraw their ambassador and hinted at economic reprisals.  Thomas R. Stauffer, research fellow in the Center for Middle Eastern Studies, has said the American economy may now suffer from Saudi reluctance to act as a moderating influence on the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.  Adverse consequences, however, are no reason to attempt what amounts to prior restraint of the press.</span></p> <p><span>On the contrary, this incident demonstrates how vital it is for the public to have opportunities to make up its own mind about a nation on which we are growing increasingly dependent as a result of President Carter's failed energy policy.  Until the U.S. develops renewable energy resources, and adequate conservation, it will continually find itself tempted to sacrifice its own values to please foreign governments.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Carter's Better Half | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>J</b>OHN NANCE GARNER, who may have made less of an impact on American politics than any high ranking U.S. official in the twentieth century, is best remembered for his comment that the vice presidency--a post he held anonymously under FDR--\"isn't worth a pitcher of warm spit.\"  Walter Mondale, conscious of Garner's feelings, insisted in 1976 that Jimmy Carter let him be an \"activist\" vice president.  \"Activist\" meant he didn't want to be treated like another former vice president and Mondale's political mentor, Hubert Humphrey, who found his way into the Oval Office as often as a lost tourist who had strayed from the morning tour of the White House.</span></p> <p><span>In fact, Mondale has become a key adviser to Carter--a rather dubious honor in recent times.  Widely regarded as unusually intelligent and a smooth operator on Capitol Hill, Mondale's main fault appears to be that his loyalty to Carter occasionally outdistances his better judgment.  And in many respects, the cool, detached liberal from Minnesota is still somewhat of an enigma in the Carter administration.</span></p> <p><span>Finlay Lewis, now the Washington bureau chief for the Minneapolis Tribune and a journalist who has covered Mondale for a decade, goes a long way toward unraveling the mystery of the Minnesota Fritz.  In his unusually candid and balanced portrait, Mondale emerges as a man of unusually good political fortune who knows how to take advantage of the many opportunities that roll his way.  Clearly he is a specialist in backroom politics, and that may account for the fact that he was appointed to nearly every significant post he has held.  His liberal idealism is tempered by a well-developed sense of political self-preservation; he knows when to shut up.  He would rather compromise and build a coalition of moderates than stand out on a limb with extremists.  And above all, Fritz Mondale lacks the limitless politics ambition that governs the actions of so many of his colleagues.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>N THAT QUALITY, Mondale was sharply contrasted with his fellow Minnesotan and erst-while mentor, Hubert Humphrey.  Mondale entered politics at the grassroots in the sometimes powerful, often self-destructive Democratic Farmer Labor Party (DFL) in Minnesota.  It was in the DFL that Mondale first linked up with Humphrey.  His awkward, sometimes competitive relationship with the fiery liberal was one of the most complicated aspects of his complicated personality.</span></p> <p><span>Humphrey and Mondale appealed to the same constituencies, and one wonders if Fritz was appointed to fill a vacancy as Minnesota's Attorney General partly in an effort to get him out of the way.  But in 1964, Mondale successfully emerged from state politics when he was appointed to fill the Senate seat that Humphrey vacated when he was sentenced to four-and-a-half years as Johnson's V.P.</span></p> <p><span>Humphrey had a lot of time on his hands to help the freshman senator after the election in late 1964, and Mondale lacked identity independent of Humphrey for several years.  As Humphrey's protege, he felt he could not criticize Johnson's war policies, and he later regretted it.  For several years, he languished in the Senate as Humphrey's mouth-piece, and didn't find an issue of his own until 1968 when, against the wishes of the Democratic leadership, he put together a remarkable coalition to pass the Open Housing legislation that was essential to the civil rights movement.  From that point forward he became a vocal champion of liberal causes, and with Nixon in the White House he no longer had to sit on his hands.  He flirted with the idea of a run for the presidency in 1976, but eventually decided he didn't have the fire in his belly to fight for the nomination.</span></p> <p><span><b>M</b>ONDALE GAINED from his experience the tools to be a genuinely active veep.  Fritz Mondale will go along and get along unless he is pressed to the wall.  Then he unleashes some awesome legislative power to get his way.  The other lesson of his terms in the Senate is something his present boss obviously has not learned:  You have to conserve your power to obtain votes for the really big issues.  Lewis claims that Fritz tried to make that point to the Georgia Mafia early in the administration, but no one was listening.  Instead, Carter flooded Congress with legislation on every conceivable topic, and much of it is still gathering dust in Congressional file cabinets.</span></p> <p><span>Mondale's greatest weakness is that he doesn't speak up often enough.  He has saved Carter from more than one foreign policy blunder, but now one senses that both are in over their depth.  He values loyalty a little too highly, and perhaps he fears that if he makes too much noise Carter will send him to the little cell in the bottom of the Executive Office Building where all the past vice presidents have been locked up.</span></p> <p><span>Lewis is quite direct in criticizing Mondale for his political misjudgments and praising him for his numerous victories.  He has written an insightful analysis of the psyche of a man who is probably overqualified for his job.  One can only hope that his otherwise successful career won't drown in the vice presidential spittoon.</span></p>"}

Head-spinning inflation, President Carter's decision to balance the budget, and Gov. Edward J. King's tax caps will combine to force sharply higher taxes and reduced services when next year's city budget goes into effect.</span></p> <p><span>The school system, largest single item in the city budget, provides a good example.  To meet King's tax cap would entail the virtual destruction of the city's schools.  Even with a 13 per cent spending increase, many supports will be removed from an already shaky system.  But, as school superintendent William Lannon and Cambridge mayor Francis H. Duehay '55 have pointed out, the city is caught in a double bind.  If taxes are raised too much, it may add further fuel to the tax-cutting fires and impair the city's ability to meet its citizens' needs even further.</span></p> <p><span>We urge the City Council to override King's cap, as it now appears likely to do.  City employees need more than a 4 per cent pay increase when inflation is nearly five times that figure.

The school committee should even consider increases in Lannon's bare-bones \"educationally sound\" budget.

{"title": "'Not What We Were Looking For' | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><i>Crimson:  Towards the end of your book you describe the Carter presidency as a tragedy.  Do you still think it is, today?</i></span></p> <p><span><i>Johnson:</i>  Yes, I do think there's a tragedy about Jimmy Carter, and I'll tell you why.  I'd been thinking back about how I felt and many people felt when he became president.  We had gone through all these shocks, pain, anguish even:  the murders of John Kennedy, Robert Kennedy--it didn't matter whether you were left, right, liberal, conservative, Black, white; everyone who offered himself up for national leadership from John Kennedy to Jimmy Carter had been destroyed.  Here comes someone totally fresh, who seemed to promise so much, and would be a <i>different</i> kind of president.  To have it ending the way it did--though it could draw on another four years--I still find, between that beginning and ending, there's a tragedy in it somewhere.</span></p> <p><span><i>Crimson:  He seems more politically successful now.</i></span></p> <p><span><i>Johnson:</i>  Yes, in the old manipulative sense.  In fact, I might even be harder on him, because to see him stand up for the third time on the eve of a primary--it happened in Wisconsin, it happened when I was out in Iowa, it happened up here in New Hampshire--\"peace is at hand.\"  Go back and look at it.  Oh yes, he's learned to use the power, better than Lyndon did, he's learned to use the manipulation of the press better than lots--call them in at 7:00 on the morning of a primary, with this wonderful \"peace is at hand\" kind of thing.  That's not what, I guess, we were looking for.</span></p> <p><span><i>Crimson:  Given the opportunity that Carter had on the eve of the presidency, as you paint it in your book, what specific qualities in him would you be able to pinpoint that led to his troubles, or what qualities would have worked better in someone else?</i></span></p> <p><span><i>Johnson:</i>  Let's start with the positive qualities.  This is a very serious man, a serious man who has informed himself on issues marvelously well.  Intellect--a first-rate mind.  Well-disciplined.  Hard worker.  Honorable--old-fashioned word.  Integrity--I believe it, a lot of people don't.  Those are all very positive things.  And a desire that is maybe quite unusual:  everyone wants to do well, but I think he particularly really wanted to do something superior, fine.</span></p> <p><span>Negative qualities:  stubborn.  A strain of pettiness that surfaces from time to time.  A kind of us-and-them feeling that does not surface much but I think is there.  I think that's endemic to anyone in the White House, but it's especially so for Jimmy Carter, coming in as the outsider, the loner, not conversant with the salons of power, coming in and running against everybody.  Carter, too, seems unable to use politics for what it should be used for.  The art of the politician, the public educator, whatever we call leadership, I think it's that--I hate the word \"leadership,\" because it's a catch-all for everything.  But let's go on with \"public educator\":  to build, to guide, direct, to channel, to chart the course.  You can argue about the direction and how we get there, but at least have it clearly defined, and keep at it, and persuade.  Those are great things; that's what a president has to do.</span></p> <p><span><i>Crimson:  Is there a real conflict between corrupt politicking and necessary, log-rolling politics or is it just that Carter doesn't understand as well as other politicans the line between them?</i></span></p> <p><span><i>Johnson:</i>  There are two things.  There's an impression one night when I asked him about the political process.  I said, \"The people complain you're not a good enough politician, and they want you to do well, Mr. President,\" and he said, \"I can't imagine sitting around and doing things the way Lyndon Johnson and Ev Dirksen used to do, trading judgeships.\"  For me at least, that was quite revealing:  it settled the way he really felt, and this perception of the process as something he wouldn't do.  That's a problem--not that you have to trade judgeships, and somebody else is doing it for him anyway, they're doing it now.  I think there is a conflict there; it seems that Jimmy Carter particularly has felt this withdrawal, the idea that politics is somehow distasteful, and it's kind of suspect, and it's not moral, seems to come through.  Certainly, in the relationships he tried to establish, no one was more open; he tried, no one listened more painfully and earnestly, and worked and solicited opinions.  But it's <i>how</i> you do it.  There's a quality of humanness, gregariousness, conviviality, whatever it is, <i>liking</i> that.  He seems to be more withdrawn.  And when you're with Carter, you always come away with a sense that he's very serious, and very quiet; you never get much of a feeling about what he himself feels.</span></p> <p><span><i>Crimson:  If Carter is clearly intelligent, as you say, he must have understood that things were not working right with Congress.  Was it some sort of paralysis, that he felt loyalty to his people?</i></span></p> <p><span><i>Johnson:</i>  I don't know how to answer that because I have never satisfactorily resolved it in my own mind.  They are a very tightly-knit group, the Carter people; there are very few of them, and he is intensely loyal to them--to very few, to Hamilton, Jody; Frank [Moore] was with him in the state house in Georgia.  He's clearly going to defend them at all costs.  I think he feels these are unfair assaults on the part of wicked Washington, and all the people who despised him anyhow, and the people in the press, and the people on the Hill, they were ganging up on him, and by God, he'd beat them, and he'd show he was right.  There is that conviction that he would triumph, that he would be proven right.  Now, that's not psychohistory, but I think that's the answer.  Otherwise, then he's a fool--and I really don't believe that at all.  I think it's the sin of pride he might preach against.</span></p> <p><span><i>Crimson:  How about the title,</i> In the Absence of Power:  <i>is the absence of power in Congress, in the presidency, in Carter himself?</i></span></p> <p><span><i>Johnson:</i>  It's a lot of things.  The presidency is operating in an absence of power it once had.  It's different, it's changed.  Congress is acting, conversely, in an absence of kinds of powers it was once able to exercise, even though it's taken some of the powers back from the presidency.  It's unable to do things in the old sense.  The country in the world is operating differently--we can no longer ordain things; I'm not sure that's at all bad, but it's a condition.  We can't just wave our hands and some \"militants\" will give up American citizens.  And we find that we can't just send in the Marines.  People themselves are operating in a time when things seem out of control and there's no system of power in the larger, not military sense, that puts them back together.  I think all of these combine to create a different kind of condition that we're now entering, politically, personally, as a nation, as people as leaders.  It's a new period.</span></p> <p><span><i>Crimson:  About inflation--it seems to me that any other president in a situation like this would be going through hell.</i></span></p> <p><span><i>Johnson:</i>  If there's a parallel for it I don't know about it.  It's inconceivable, with the kinds of problems we face here and abroad, that this president doesn't seem to be bearing the political liabilities for it, the wave of anger.  I can speculate about it; I think it's because we do feel that no one has any better answers.  The economists can't agree on anything.  You step back and say, how can I possibly know what's right?  You say, yes, I know all about the president, he's not the best</span></p> <p><span><i>Haynes Johnson is a columnist for the Washington Post.  This interview conducted by Scott A. Rosenberg.</i> we've ever had, he may be pretty terrible, but he's trying hard.  He's a good man, he's decent, and so forth.  I think that's what's happening, I don't know.  But it's eerie, it's extraordinary.</span></p> <p><span><i>Crimson:  What about Carter's opportunity when the hostages were first taken to rally the country around a solid energy conservation program?</i></span></p> <p><span><i>Johnson:</i>  Yes, with all of those things happening it gave him this opportunity, and he didn't take it again.</span></p> <p><span><i>Crimson:  Carter had already presented \"his\" energy program the year before.  Was that it?</i></span></p> <p><span><i>Johnson:</i>  I asked him this question.  It seemed to me he had an historic opportunity to take all of these things, go to the nation and really keep reaching them.  I think that Carter came back with the answer, \"Well, I've already laid it all out, I laid it all out--you remember--three years ago, and you made fun of me, calling it 'meow,' and it turns out I was right.\"  This is where the self-righteousness, the belief in self, and a certain...edginess, a certain tension came over.  Defensiveness.  He somehow thinks that, if he lays it all out, they'll understand and they'll act--that that's the way a public leader leads.  Well, that's not what the instinct of a public educator would say:  you've got to keep trying to reach them.</span></p> <p><span>That's what Carter has not done.  And I think that's tragic.  There was another absolutely magnificent opportunity at a time when we were united--and he became the personification of the country in a way he had not been.  The Ayatollah made him.  It wasn't just those fists being waved every night on television, it wasn't just the chants, and it wasn't just the American flag being burned--it was Jimmy Carter being burned in effigy, it was the face of Jimmy Carter being taunted and torched and hung, and the crowds were chanting \"Death to Jimmy Carter\" and \"Death to America,\" and it was the Ayatollah who said, \"Reject this--Carter is the great Satan,\" or whatever.  So he became out of all of this the personification of the country in a time of trouble.  He could have taken that moment and reached beyond the day-to-day political apparatus.</span></p> <p><span><i>Crimson:  You devote much of the beginning of your book to describing the sense of promise in the nation in 1976.  Today, it seems to me, there's much more an atmosphere of fear.  Do you think the fear of governmental collapse--I don't even mean through war, but just structurally--is well-grounded?</i></span></p> <p><span><i>Johnson:</i>  I hope I haven't suggested that it's hopeless for us.  I don't believe that.  Maybe I'm just old-fashioned and naive, but I do believe there's a mature side of our society that I think is very positive.  There's structural reforms we can make--a six-year presidency, a regional primary system, more discussion, celebrating the public servants--there are a lot of things that are there to be done, and we aren't doing them.  I think that's a way out.  And the energy question; we <i>can</i> be more self-sufficient.  Our life will be different--that doesn't mean it's going to be worse.  That's the point.  It's a tragedy that we are not getting a clear voice and picture and vision and discussion about these things</span></p>"}
{"title": "One Born Every Minute | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>A</b>RAM BAKSHIAN, JR. is proud of the fact that the guy who tends bar at the National Press Club--the capitol's branch of Alcoholics Anonymous--knows what he drinks.  For Bakshian, it's been a long trip up from copy boy at <i>U.S. News and World Report</i> to \"White House insider.\"  He lumbers across the lounge--grey herringbone, white shirt with maroon navy pencil-thin tie, grey flannels--a figure that any Young Republican could look up to.  As he talks--fast, clipped tones that emerge from somewhere under his Groucho Marx mustache--Bakshian switches back and forth from cigar to definitive statement to bottle of Bock's Beer.</span></p> <p><span>Bakshian spent two months writing.  Late at night, a glass of port in one hand and his brain in the other, Bakshian looked out over the Potomac and composed his first book.  The publisher asked him, he explains, to go out on a limb, to write a book handicapping the chances of the candidates in search of the Republican and Democratic presidential nominations.  Bakshian sees his book as something that may educate the electorate and \"help us explain how these people get into office.\"  He stops to preach.  \"If people are that goddamned concerned, then they've got to do a bit more than occasionally sit through the evening news.\"  Like buy his book.</span></p> <p><span>This is an uncomplicated book written by an uncomplicated man.  Bakshian has taken the classic election metaphor--the candidates as horses, the journalist as oddsmaker--and stretched it, beaten it and pummelled it into submission.  Throw aside the introduction and the conclusion--which is very easy to do--and you're left with a $12.95 list of the candidates and their chances for making it through the conventions alive.</span></p> <p><span>Bakshian's methods are simple; he labels his scoring system the \"Seven Deadly Whims.\"  He moves from candidate to candidate, judging each on the basis of (1) leadership, (2) communication, (3) organization, (4) war chest, (5) age/health, (6) marriage/family and (7) wildcard.  A candidate's positions on the issues are not included, he says, because issues fit into the other categories.  At the end of the book, the horses are given scores, the scores are tallied up to find the winners.</span></p> <p><span>Bakshian wrote the balance of the book in October and November and, for the most part, his predictions have held true.  In his scatter-shot prose, punctuated by certain frequent references to what a brilliant guy he is, Bakshian tell us that Teddy Kennedy (who rates a total of 64 out of 100 points) will edge out Jimmy Carter (61) for the Democratic nomination.  What has gone wrong?  A combination of Kennedy's personal vulnerabilities and the situation in Iran has thrown the election into the president's corner, Bakshian says, but he's quick to add that \"Carter has really been a disaster.\"</span></p> <p><span>On the Republican side, Bakshian is more at home, and by November had already written off Howard Baker--low scores on organization, John Connally--issues of \"trust\"--and John Anderson.  Writing off George Bush as a possibility but not a probability, Bakshian offers the following scenario:</span></p> <p><span>If Reagan can win in New Hampshire (and running against a scattered field of opponents he can do so easily just by holding onto a large chunk of the 48 per cent of Republican votes he received in the 1976 primary there); if he can make a better than expected minority showing against George Bush in Massachusetts; if he can bury Connally by strong wins in South Carolina and Florida, and then carry Illinois--then he just might be able to coast all the way to the convention after March 18th.</span></p> <p><span>Sound familiar?  Bakshian is proud of his prediction and says, at this point in the race, \"Reagan has to fall on his face or he's got it.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>LL OF THIS, of course, could have been said very easily in a short, snappy article for <i>Politics Today.</i>  Instead, Bakshian spends 250 pages telling us about the race, the candidates, and, most of all, himself.  The problem, in short, is the book demands the \"armed neutrality\" that Bakshian said he started with, and Aram Bakshian is a screaming Republican.  His resume reads like <i>What's What</i> in GOP boners in the last ten years.  From 1971 to 1972, special assistant to then chairman of the Republican National Committee, Bob Dole.  In June of 1972, he joined the White House, four days before the Watergate break-in (\"if I'd known then, maybe I wouldn't have gone\") and stayed on to write speeches for Nixon and Connally's I'm-a-Republican address.</span></p> <p><span>Recently, Bakshian took some time off from freelancing to help Dick Nixon edit his memoirs.  On the issues, he admits, he stands closest to George Bush.  And Bakshian says that Jerry Ford (\"on all the big things, he made the right decisions\"), Alexander Haig or Scoop Jackson (save for the fact that \"he has all the personality of a three-day-old Fresca\") would function well in the White House.</span></p> <p><span>Bakshian's political outlook doesn't seep into the book; it overwhelms it.  Any Democrat is either a fool or a lecher.  While the author spends 10 single-spaced pages spelling out the intricacies of Chappaquiddick (and quoting George F. Will), he disregards Bush's role in the CIA, Connally's adventure in the dairy business and Reagan's innumerable bloopers.  Instead of a balanced view of Big John, we are treated to a verbatim transcript of his plan for peace in the Middle East.  To Bakshian, anything to the left of Eisenhower is deserving of slander.  \"So John Anderson's for abortion,\" he quotes someone identified only as \"a crusty New Hampshire Republican\"--\"Too bad his parents didn't feel the same way.\"</span></p> <p><span>At times, <i>The Candidates--1980</i> strays into the self-indulgent and the absurd.  No self-respecting author would quote articles from <i>The American Spectator</i> at length and then reveal--several times, in fact--that he wrote them.  But then again, the man who wrote this book boasts that he has been published in international editions of <i>Reader's Digest.</i>  There are numerous factual errors; on a list of obstacles that stand between the candidates and the conventions, Bakshian overlooks the New York primary.  Where Bakshian is at his best--conversational, witty, on target--he is quoting liberally from people who really know their stuff and adding in analysis that, given two months and a large contract, anybody could have thought of.</span></p> <p><span>This election year is already depressing enough without books like this.  But we can all be thankful at least for one thing:  Aram Bakshian, Jr. isn't running for president.</span></p> <p><span><b>Late at night, a glass of port in one hand and his brain in the other, Bakshian looked out over the Potomac and composed his first book.</b></span></p>"}

But a new element has been added to the equation in the last few months--young people, high school and college students and others who will be affected by the plan, have rallied large-scale opposition to the registration.</span></p> <p><span>If Carter and Congress are not swayed by arguments of policy and reason, it seems unlikely that the prospect of widespread unwillingness to cooperate with registration will affect their decision.  But before they force the country into another era of division and confrontation like the opposition to the Vietnam War.  Congress and the president should at least consider that consequence.</span></p>"}

What if one of those species is mankind?\"  he added.</span></p> <p><span>Between 15 and 20 million people starve to death annually, though the world has twice as much food as it needs to support its current population of 4.5 billion, Denver said.  \"It's an educational problem, one of distributing food among nations--not a scarcity problem,\" he added.</span></p> <p><span>He said hunger \"is a strong enough issue--one which touches enough people inside themselves\" to promote unity, adding that only recently have Americans become aware of the transnational importance of critical issues like energy.</span></p> <p><span>\"You don't know how lucky we are in our affluence--it's the way we've been brought up to live,\" Denver said while criticizing America for its high level of oil consumption.  \"It's no longer appropriate--we're actually talking about going to war to get gasoline, not to get what we need, but what we want,\" he added.</span></p> <p><span>Denver called for public pressure to increase developmental aid--possibly through decreasing military expenditures.  \"Foreign aid has either been weapons assistance or defense assistance, or is exploitative.  We've got to stop that,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>\"If we'd given Iran not weapons but books, hoes, spades and food, we would not have the problem we're dealing with now,\" he added.</span></p> <p><span>\"We must assist the developing world to get on its feet.  We do have the wherewithal to eliminate hunger in the next 15 years,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>Denver also criticized world dependence on nuclear energy, adding that demonstrations like the one at Seabrook can set a precedent for public action on pressing problems like energy or hunger.</span></p> <p><span>When a listener asked Denver how he could justify working on the commission as an appointee of President Carter, who she said had supported military expenditures instead of developmental aid, he said, \"I refuse to get involved in the election or the campaign.  I'm just serving my president right now--he's the one who can get things done.\"</span></p> <p><span>But he added, \"I deplore the fact that he's going in the direction of military spending.

Three days before the New Hampshire primary, politics permeates the strip--Phil Crane's headquarters features a one-story full-color poster of the Illinois congressman's face.  Jerry Brown wafts in a cloud of reporters, up and down the sidewalk, greeting Bush supporters gathered in the doorway of the Republican's office.  A diversionary force of 3000 college students marches down one lane, leaving enough room for cars to pass, stopping to heckle the headquarters staff of candidates who favor draft registration.  John Anderson workers hand New Hampshire residents pamphlets on \"What New Hampshire Residents Say about John Anderson.\"  Politics as carnival.</span></p> <p><span>But LaRouche headquarters, an unmarked third story suite, bustles with serious people.  This is the state office, not to be confused with the four other offices in Manchester alone, and only the most diehard LaRouche supporters spend their days here, distributing the bumper stickers to all corners of the state.  \"We can't keep this one in print,\" a beaming aide says, holding a blue and white sticker which reads \"Jerry Brown Goes Down More Than Nuclear Power Plants.\"</span></p> <p><span>A few steps through the sunlight, and then into the McDonalds, where the LaRouche press secretary agrees to talk huddled in the gloom over a cup of coffee.  Ted Andromidas is tired, and a little bitter.  \"We know the election is in the can--bought, rigged and paid for,\" he says.  But there's a little fight left in him.  \"Kennedy is one of the most immoral scum ever to hit the country...  Brown's not even a flake--he's organized crime.  Reagan's a nice uninformed old man.  Bush, Anderson--these guys are Trilateral Commission all the way.\"  Andromidas lives in a world where the Skull and Bones club appointed William Sloane Coffin to handle the \"left Jacobin mob\"; where the government, trying to repeat Britain's \"opium sedation\" of the Chinese, paid Leary and Alpert and Kesey and all his pranksters to popularize LSD; where George Bush is nuts for considering nuclear war.  It's an intense world.  It feels good to stride back out into the Elm St. sun and talk with the elderly man whose sign reads \"Iran Still Holds Our Hostages--Put Kennedy in the White House\" sign.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b> GOOD political pamphlet is a work of art; the art has been corrupted in recent years by the willingness of candidates to gloss over even their nearest approaches to real positions in an out-pouring of feel-good-about-America, new-direction-for-the-70s, time-for-a-man-with-character froth.</span></p> <p><span>But Lyndon H. LaRouche is an old-schooler, and the piles of literature that bow the card tables of his devoted workers are vintage.  Every few days during the Granite State contest, the two-page \"Campaign News\" would appear in LaRouche offices around the state.  The paper proves LaRouche is no squeamish campaigner; \"Khomeini Backer to Head Procession in Manchester\" screams one headline in the Feb. 21 issue, and who can resist reading on?  \"Ramsey Clark, the defender of the terrorist Red Brigades and the Baader-Meinof gang in Europe, reportedly will be leading a march on the streets of Manchester on Saturday as a member of the International Association of Defense Lawyers.  It's the closest Manchester citizens will come to seeing the Ayatollah Khomeini face to face.\"</span></p> <p><span>The staff of the Campaign News sees foreign influence everywhere; the Portsmouth Herald, \"controlled by the foreigner, Lord Thomson of Fleet Street,\" won't allow the docks at Portsmouth to be expanded, the publication complains.  Instead, it insists on a pleasure boat marina, with all the attendant \"pleasures of Sodom and Gomorrah keeping the local inhabitants employed as low-paid dishwashers, croupiers, shills and errand boys for the wastrel \"industries' of Babylon.\"</span></p> <p><span>And there are messages from the candidate to the faithful and the faithless.  \"LaRouche Derides Carter Supporters as 'Immoral'\" one headline reads.  LaRouche \"tonight derided any person who publicly endorses President Jimmy Carter as 'immoral,' a person to be pitied by his friends and neighbors...  There is no error or exaggeration in saying that the economic policies of the Carter administration are Nazi,\" the LaRouche onslaught continues.  Then, the telling blow.  \"LaRouche qualified his denunciation of Carter by indicating that Republican George Bush was far worse than Carter.\"  The reason?  \"Bush's campaign has consciously adopted the policies of Nazi Herrmann Goering...(who) proposed to crush the German civilian economy with a massive arms drive.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>T THE DOOR, the private security force checks everyone attending this final statewide rally for Lyndon Hermyle LaRouche Jr., Democrat for President, running the metal detector over their bodies.  \"We'd prefer you didn't take pictures of the security operation,\" one guard says, and the request has no escape clause.  \"People are finally beginning to realize they won't be able to defraud us out of the election--we just don't know how desperate they're going to get,\" Laura Cohen, a campaign aide says in explanation.</span></p> <p><span>On stage, the pre-speech entertainment, soprano Joan Moynaugh, director of Musicians for LaRouche, speaks with a strangely moving rhythm.  \"We sing because it is natural to do so...  The spirit moves and the spirit sings--it is an informed spirit to be sure...  We have been in the company of geniuses...  Tonight we play the work of these musical geniuses for a man who in his own realm is a genius...\"  And then, for 45 minutes the great religious homages of the masters, \"And the Glory of the Lord shall be revealed,\" \"And he shall purify,\" \"I know thay my redeemer liveth on the earth,\" building to the Alleluia chorus, and the crowd of 600 on its feet for the climax \"And glory will reign forever and ever.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"And now let's welcome the next President of the United States of America, Lyndon LaRouche.\"</span></p> <p><span>Not a bit abashed by the buildup, LaRouche takes the microphone.  He starts slowly, with the expected discussion of massive vote fraud and the remarks about the nastiness of the press, including an offhand reference to \"Katharine Meyer Graham's Washington Post.\"  A comparison of himself to DeGaulle.  Then the speech starts to build; and if some of the words resemble those of other candidates, the message doesn't.  \"The U.S. has a moral destiny to fulfull among other nations, on the behalf of civilization.\"  From the audience, an echoing \"Amen.\"  \"We have to start from finding what our mission is, and then work to make ourselves strong, productive, healthy and educated enough to fulfill that mission.\"  Before he's done, the crowd is on its feet, chanting \"Win with Lyn,\" even the guards smiling, chanting.</span></p> <p><span>It's a comedown when LaRouche starts to answer questions, telling 11-year-old kids he will improve the schools by ridding the ranks of teachers \"of SDS graduates who can't teach anything except how to smoke a joint and rock dancing.\"  But before he leaves, someone asks him about how to convince others to jump aboard the LaRouche bandwagon.  In a moment of weakness, LaRouches tells of his campaign trail frustrations.  \"You talk to people, and they say that Milton Friedman would disagree.  What you've got to do is remove the influence of Milton Friedman.  Milton Friedman is a Nazi.\"</span></p>"}

{"title": "Sedition, Taiwanese Style | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>An activist in the struggle for women's equality in Taiwan for more than a decade, the 35-year-old Lu came to Harvard in part to gain more legal knowledge to aid her human rights activities in her native country, Wang Shu-ying, a friend of Lu's, said this week.  Before her studies abroad, Lu had set up a publishing house for feminist literature and a telephone hotline for women with family problems.  The government closed both facilities.  When she returned to Taiwan in 1978 after graduating from law school, Lu rejoined the group of lawyers, government officials, businessmen, doctors, students and workers comprising the growing opposition to the ruling Kuomintang (KMT), Nationalist Chinese Party--the only legal political party in Taiwan.  What brought the group together was a desire to protest the oppression they felt from the mainland Chinese who established their own \"Free Chinese\" state on the island after the Communist victory in 1949.</span></p> <p><span>The small but vocal opposition group demanded that the government end its 30 years of martial law and hold national elections to replace the aging members of the rubber stamp National Assembly, still dominated by the KMT.  The government heeded the second demand--but only partially.  It agreed to hold elections in December 1978 to fill 59 of the assembly's more than 1400 seats and allowed just two weeks for campaigning.  Lu ran as an independent from her hometown of Taoyuan, an electronics center west of Taipei.  During her short campaign, she advocated three rights for her fellow native Taiwanese:  the right to know, the right to free speech, and the right to have a voice in their future.</span></p> <p><span>\"I got very political once I started running,\" Lu said in an interview earlier this year.  \"I based the campaign on the Taiwanese right to self-determination.  Sometimes I even made crowds cry, reminding them of their history, how they had been invaded by the Portugese Spanish, Manchus, Japanese--all outsiders--and that it was much the same today.  That the Kuomintang was not elected to rule us, that they were colonial rulers, too,\" she said.</span></p> <p><span>A diplomatic move by the United States dashed the hopes of opposition candidates like Lu to gain seats in the assembly.  On Dec. 16, 1978, halfway through the campaign, President Carter announced the opening of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China.  The KMT immediately called off the election, claiming the U.S.-Chinese move had precipitated a national emergency and uncertainty about the future.  Taiwan remained, as it had been for 30 years, \"effectively a one-party state,\" as a State Department official called it at a hearing before the House International Relations Committee in June 1977.</span></p> <p><span>For several months after the government closed the electoral process to her, Lu continued her opposition activities underground.  In August 1979, however, she became a vice president and editor of a new opposition publication, Formosa Magazine.  Run by members of the opposition, Formosa Magazine grew increasingly vocal in calling for governmental and social reforms.</span></p> <p><span>The publication became the voice for many of the Taiwanese who sought greater influence in their own government, Rep. Jim Leach (R-Iowa) told the House of Representatives on Dec. 20, 1979.  \"The magazine became a focal point for opposition points of view and its organizational structure came to function almost as a pseudo-political party.  It was critical of one-party rule on the island and urged greater opportunity for political freedom for the native-born Taiwanese, who constitute 85 per cent of the population,\" Leach said.</span></p> <p><span>Formosa Magazine printed 45,000 copies of its first issue and doubled its circulation in three months, according to a newsletter from the International Committee for the Defense of Human Rights in Taiwan (ICDHRT), an organization with offices in Seattle, Wash., and Japan which attempts to publicize the plight of political dissidents in Taiwan.  With the increase in circulation, however, came an increase in attacks, both verbal and physical, against the publication from enraged private citizens.  Opposition members suspect that Taiwan's secret police agencies, the Taiwan Garrison Command and the Investigation Bureau, sanctioned the abuses.</span></p> <p><span>Despite the attacks, the magazine planned to sponsor a demonstration to commemorate International Human Rights Day on Dec. 10, 1979.  It asked the government for permission to hold an outdoor rally in a park in central Kaohsiung, an industrial port city on the south coast of the island. Although the KMT denied the request, the magazine's staff decided to proceed with plans for the rally.</span></p> <p><span>On the evening of Dec. 10, 1979, supporters of the magazine met at its office in Kaohsiung.  Police and military forces cordoned off the building as a crowd estimated at several thousand gathered in the area.  When between 200 and 300 of the demonstrators tried to leave the building to begin their march to the park, the authorities tried to restrain them.</span></p> <p><span>\"We were being boxed in by the riot trucks on one side and by a thin line of riot troops in full gear on the other side.  When the people in the crowd on the sidelines saw the police attacking us, they rushed to our aid and pushed the riot police back, and they (the police) were scattered all over.  I could see the flicker of fear in their eyes; they (the police) didn't really want to fight.  They moved back very quickly,\" Linda Gail Arrigo, believed to be the only American to take part in the demonstration and wife of Formosa magazine manager Shih Ming-teh, recalled after the incident.</span></p> <p><span>After the police retreated, the demonstrators and many onlookers returned to the Formosa office, where, Arrigo continued, \"things were very peaceful: we had a large crowd around us, and we continued to sing Taiwan folk songs.  There were many strong statements:  'We want human rights.  We want democracy.  We want an end to dictatorial government and martial law.'\"</span></p> <p><span>At about 10 p.m., as the organizers began trying to disperse the rally, \"the riot police trucks arrived and smashed into the crowd,\" Arrigo said.  In his report to the House, Rep. Leach said confrontations between government authorities and demonstrators continued until early morning. \"What we saw, I think, was a tremendous anger at the authorities, perhaps more than I would have expected.  We saw a tremendous rise in 'Taiwan consciousness' and a real cry against martial law,\" Arrigo said.  \"I would say that it was a major step forward in strengthening the identity of the Taiwan people, but whatever will happen now may not be pleasant, but it is a pleasure to see the people express themselves,\" she added.</span></p> <p><span>What happened after the demonstration was, as Arrigo predicted, not pleasant.  Less than 24 hours after the crowds dispersed, police started arresting more than 100 opposition activists, including Lu.  The government also deported Arrigo and closed down Formosa Magazine.  It had published only four issues.\"  We thought we could resist arrests.  We thought the Nationalists would have avoided this to seek further consensus and gain mass support.  But we were wrong,\" she told the Christian Science Monitor shortly after leaving Taiwan.  Leach described the government's reaction as \"the largest mass arrest of opposition forces in Taiwan's recent political history.\"</span></p> <p><span>Of the dozens arrested, the government charged eight with sedition, a crime which carries a sentence of seven years in prison to death.  The eight have remained in custody since their arrests, while the government has postponed their trial several times.  The latest delay occurred last week, after authorities allowed the dissidents to see relatives for the first time since their imprisonment.</span></p> <p><span>Lu met with her brother and sister, who asked her if the authorities had treated her badly.  Lu responded with a faint smile and said they had not, Gerrit van Derwees, U.S. coordinator for the ICDHRT, said earlier this week after talking with lawyers for the dissidents.  As Lu met with her siblings, another prisoner, Lin Yi-hsiung, a lawyer and legal adviser to Formosa Magazine, told his mother that he had signed a confession involuntarily.  Lin's mother later called a friend in Japan to describe her son's condition.  Two hours after she made the call, she and Lin's two young daughters were found dead.</span></p> <p><span>When the trial begins, it \"will definitely be an open one\" and those convicted will be punished on the basis of the evidence presented, not the public demands, a ranking KMT official said last month.  The Taiwanese press has been running letters and articles accusing the \"Formosa group\" of \"disrupting the stability of society\" and demanding severe punishment.</span></p> <p><span>Despite assurances of a fair trial, the government has taken steps to hinder the activities of defense lawyers, van Derwees said.  Among the restrictions:  they will have only three days to examine evidence collected by the government and will be allowed only to hand copy those materials; they will be permitted to meet with the defendants for only 40 minutes to discuss strategy, and the Taiwan Garrison Command, a secret police agency, will record those meetings; and they will not be able to cross-examine prosecution witnesses.</span></p> <p><span>These violations of legal processes are the latest in a series of infringements on human rights that have increased in number since the Kaohsiung demonstration, which, said Leach, \"could have been peaceful, demonstrating to outside observers that there was hope that the KMT authorities and the Taiwanese majority could work together in the exercise of democratic rights which many believe are essential to the future freedom and independence of Taiwan.\"  Instead, Leach continued, \"hardline elements among the ruling group have increasingly come to prevail.\"  As a result, Lu and her fellow oppostion leaders remain in jail, victims of a system they have tried to change.</span></p> <p><span>'I based the campaign on the Taiwanese right to self-determination.  Sometimes I even made crowds cry, reminding them of their history...'</span></p>"}
{"title": "Guns and Barter | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>J</b>UST THREE MONTHS after legislative approval of the M-X, the new mobile missile, there is another addition to the military hardware bin:  the F-X, or \"Fighter-X.\"  Presumably when these weapons are used to show Moscow the way to reason, the spectacle will be called \"War-X.\"</span></p> <p><span>The \"X\" in M-X doesn't stand for anything at all, but the \"X\" in Fighter-X means \"export.\"  It is the first weapon made by the United States solely for this purpose, thereby announcing our formal entrance into the world arms sales business, and the escalation of a dangerous trend in American foreign policy.</span></p> <p><span>Since the Nixon administration decided that the Shah was a good bet in the Persian Gulf region, America has handled out arms in increasingly large numbers, presumably to forestall the Soviet menace.  Some countries, like Saudi Arabia, already have the requisite bucks and simply extend the payments over a long period.  For smaller outposts of democracy, such as the Marcos government in the Phillippines and the Somoza exregime in Nicaragua, the U.S. government either grants military aid, which is used for arms purchases, or extends a line of credit for 10 per cent of the purchase, and allows the remainder to be repaid as a long-term loan.  Recent U.S. beneficiaries of such arrangements include Turkey, which has occupied Cyprus illegally since 1974 (using American arms), and North Yemen.  In the wake of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, many have suggested we provide arms to Pakistan, which is currently building an atomic bomb financed by Colonel Qadaffi of Libya.</span></p> <p><span>Not only does this practice make the Carter Administration's concept of a \"moral foreign policy\" about as useful as old \"Whip Inflation Now\" buttons, but it tends to have serious backlash effects.   When people in Tehran, Managua, and elsewhere see their neighbors gunned down by government troops using American tanks and M-16s, they often view the United States as an imperialist power supporting non-democratic regimes, not at all the image we try to portray to the nations of the Third World.  While in some cases the U.S. may have to provide arms as a deterrent to Soviet expansion--to the NATO countries, for example--it is a dangerous expedient to send such goods wherever dictators desire.</span></p> <p><span>Furthermore, selling multi-billion dollar hardware to other nations increases our own economic problems.  Just as the Vietnam War boom led to sharp inflation in the early 1970's, the expenditure of huge sums of money by foreign governments on American arms often causes similar difficulties abroad.  Revenue that could be spent on jobs and food instead goes out of the country in large quantities, precipitating a trade imbalance.  One popular method of offsetting this problem for many Third World countries is to raise the prices of oil or raw material exports, so that the inflationary effects rebound to the industrial powers.  One doesn't need an economic expert to point out the production of large steel hulks to sit on Mideast runways adds less to the Gross National Product than consumer goods that create a \"ripple effect\" of employment and income in the service and management fields.</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>HY THEN does the U.S. government follow such a counterproductive policy?  It is no coincidence that the announcement of the production of \"Fighter X-port\" comes on the heels of the grain embargo to the Soviet Union and the OPEC price increase.  The arms trade has become an essential part of our export business, without which the U.S. would face a serious balance of trade deficit and a severe economic slump in 1980.  While the OPEC price increase adds a few billion dollars to the import side of the ledger, the grain embargo reduces export revenue by another few billion dollars, adding to an already large ($30 billion) annual shortfall.  Now the nations of the world may not want American steel, American television sets, or American cars, but they love our fighter planes.</span></p> <p><span>The first problem with this \"solution\" is the continuation of the \"Band-Aid\" approach to our economic woes--a practice that becomes increasingly popular in election years.  Recent studies have suggested that plants involved in arms manufacture can be converted to such necessary industries as mass transportation, solar energy, and solid waste disposal, using many of the present technologies.  The federal government alone could create this change, first by reducing its own purchases of arms and restricting the sale of U.S. arms around the globe, then by offering loans to firms and communities planning conversion of munitions works.  This would be similar to the Defense Production Act of 1950, which was used in just the opposite way--to convert civilian industries to armament production.</span></p> <p><span>In order to establish such a program Americans must first realize that the greatest threat to our national security is not military, but rather our parasitical dependence on potentially hostile nations for energy.  The solution to this problem, instead of selling fighter planes for a quick \"fix\" of cash that can buy a few more barrels, is a concentrated program of developing alternate energy sources (such as solar or synthetic fuels) and curbing our wasteful energy habits (by the increased use of mass transportation, for example).  Only by viewing this as a crucial matter of \"national security\" can such a comprehensive change come about--after all, that's how we got the national highway system.</span></p> <p><span>Just as distressing, the F-X decision fails once again to connect trade with foreign policy aims.  As long as the U.S. continues to sell planes, tanks, and guns to any government that feels--or imagines that it feels--the hot breath of Soviet pursuit, it runs the risk of being seen as a warmongering imperialist.  With the production of a fighter plane strictly for export, we step blatantly into the role of \"agent of destruction,\" not \"defender of the free world.\"</span></p>"}

{"title": "Mobilization Madness | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>HERE'S SAFETY in numbers, or so President Carter wants the nation to believe.  His proposal to reinstate draft registration would build a national data bank with names and numbers for millions of American youths--a computerized blueprint for national mobilization.  Carter admits it's a symbolic act to demonstrate American resolve to the Soviets, not a military necessity.  But the symbolic value of draft registration sends a quicker message to American voters than to the Kremlin:  Carter can appear to take a hard line against the U.S.S.R. and to bolster national defense through a relatively inexpensive information-gathering process.  Draft registration is his placebo to soothe America's war fever; its numbers can't make us any safer, but can at least make us feel better.</span></p> <p><span>The White House makes its case for registration--which it calls \"selective service revitalization\"--in a pea-soup fog of war; sometimes it's easier to puzzle out how the rebels are faring in the hills of Afghanistan than to divine Carter's rationale for sending 19- and 20-year-olds to their local post-office windows.  His proposal comes under the umbrella of the \"Carter doctrine,\" his promise to defend the Persian Gulf by--gasp--any means necessary.  A year ago, his administration rejected a return to draft registration; the Pentagon had much more confidence in the volunteer army than Congressional critics looking for something to criticize.  Today the White House says, \"Recent events have shown us that more dramatic efforts are in order.  We need to show our determination to check Soviet aggression.\"  The military requirements of defending American interests haven't changed much since then, but Carter feels a need to liven up the foreign policy drama he's writing.</span></p> <p><span>Draft registration has unquestionable symbolic value, domestically, as the political success of Carter's arms-akimbo military posture shows.  It plays on a centuries-old collective emotion, the kind of thing history texts mention under the heading \"Rise of the Nation-States.\"  Napoleon's <i>levee en masse</i> introduced the modern world to the idea of the nation-in arms, and the rest of Europe ended up adopting the same means to frustrate France's expansionary ends.  National mobilization took the very decision of war and peace out of the hands of European leaders in August 1914; once the go-ahead for mobilization reached the countryside, and soldiers gathered at railway depots, the various nations-in-arms had little choice but to fight.  The ideology of national mobilization tends to foster a feeling of security; however, it has also historically promoted military adventurism, and even the kind of expansionary nationalism dimly remembered today as cries for <i>\"lebensraum.\"</i></span></p> <p><span>No wonder, then, that registration--and the actual draft it makes possible--helps allay the voters' fear of weakness, and spreads a halo of potency around the same armed forces we've had for almost a decade.  The symbol Carter invoked in his State of the Union speech can mesmerize Americans easily enough.  But it will not show the Soviet Union determination or anything else unless it represents a substantial military advantage.  It will have to be as handy a weapon in whatever struggle Carter anticipates with Russia as it's been in the battles in Iowa and New Hampshire.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE STRONGEST ARGUMENT against draft registration--one that should make as much sense to the man or woman afraid our military has gone to pot as to the student whose political mythology crystallizes around the Vietnam war--is that it answers no current military need, fills no breaches in our national barricades.  It is the form of national defense without the substance.  Its proponents recite a list of indictments against the volunteer army (which the Defense Department, characteristically, calls the \"All Volunteer Force\" or AVF):  its recruiting techniques don't fill manpower quotas, its recruits aren't smart enough to fight a modern war, and the kids it brings in from the inner cities are more interested in getting high than in defending their homeland.</span></p> <p><span>The weight of these charges wasn't enough to convince either the Pentagon or the White House last year to scrap the AVF.  Actually, the three services fell only 7 per cent short of their recruiting goals last year, and platoon sergeants swore to New York Times reporters that the latest privates were as good as any they'd seen.  More immediately relevant, though, draft registration would neither replace nor bolster the volunteer army.  Carter has explicitly stated he doesn't plan to use peacetime conscription to fill recruitment quotas.  And the inductees of a peacetime draft are as little likely to be gung-ho as their volunteer peers.</span></p> <p><span>Presumably, then, draft registration would only be of use in the event of war--but what sort of war?  Carter's coupling of the registration proposal with his new doctrine has created the fuzzy impression that somehow draft registration will help when the Soviets close their geo-political pincer on the Persian Gulf.  But it's obvious a Carter Doctrine war would require equipment far more than men.  It would be a war of relatively small forces relying on sophisticated weaponry as well as air and sea support--the kind of war Israel has been winning for decades.  It demands quality, not quantity, of soldiers, and draftees would simply not fit the bill.  The 13 days draft registration would save in getting those men onto the field would also be 13 fewer days of training.  Military historians like B.H. Lidell Hart agree that in contemporary warfare, sending green conscripts into battle before they know how to use all the gadgetry would cripple any fighting force.</span></p> <p><span>The Pentagon understands this as well as anyone; that's why it wants a Rapid Deployment Force of 100,000 men trained in the art of the brushfire war and the lightning intervention.  But it has requested draft registration anyway under the influence of a doctrine it calls \"the one-and-a-half war theory,\" tested in 1978 in the largest simulation of a world war ever.  The computer assumed a global one-two punch from the Soviet Union:  a move into some secondary theater of war--like, say, the Persian Gulf--pinning down America's most mobile and effective forces, followed by a massive assault in Western Europe.  This half-war followed by all-out war apparently scared Pentagon analysts, who found American military manpower and reserves couldn't handle the simultaneous demands.  No wonder:  the computer predicted 500,000 casualties in Europe in the first six weeks.  To replace those numbers, the U.S. doesn't even have the transport aircraft to deliver the bodies of recruits, let alone equipment, supplies, and ammunition.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>O KEEP THE U.S. prepared to win the sort of war the Pentagon outlined in 1978 would essentially require a war-time level of military spending, today.  The simple realities of a domestic economy, not to mention other valid claims on government resources, rule out such a budget.  It's naive, however, for anyone--anti-draft activist or Pentagon computer--to assume that such a huge war would not escalate up the nuclear ladder, from conventional warfare to \"limited nuclear war\" to Armageddon.  If the planning to fight this conventional war in Europe means that the U.S. has given up the idea of nuclear deterrence altogether, then our military policy needs total rethinking, not just the cosmetics of draft registration.</span></p> <p><span>Under the guise of showing Brezhnev our fists clenched in anger over Afghanistan and our readiness to defend the emirates and kingdoms of the Persian Gulf, Carter has proposed reviving draft registration.  He's just not mentioning over national television that the real purpose of that draft would be to fight a conventional World War III in Europe.</span></p>"}

Somebody in Washington was watching the CIA reports that showed North Vietnamese troops hiding in sanctuaries on the Cambodian side of the border.  Somebody decided that the best way to flush the North Vietnamese out was to destroy the sanctuaries.  But, as Shawcross demonstrates in <i>Sideshow,</i> they forgot that the bombs might hit a few Cambodians.</span></p> <p><span>Willie Shawcross is not the chain-smoking, scrappy-looking reporter you'd imagine as <i>Sideshow's</i> author.  Shawcross, tall, quiet, soft-spoken, strikes one as a British academic, looking for the fact that may reveal the truth, but not aiming to promote himself.</span></p> <p><span>He shrugs off any glorification of his approach, or his mastery of the Woodstein technique.  \"Investigative reporting is a stupid term,\" he says definitively.  \"Decent reporting is by definition investigative.\"  For Shawcross, <i>Sideshow</i> was an extension of his earlier days on the <i>Times'</i> insight team.</span></p> <p><span>For a man who wrote what many say is history at its best, Shawcross doesn't like to look behind.  He worries about what is going on in Cambodia now.  He worries about British reporters who, bound and gagged by that country's Official Secrets Act, will never gain access to documents that Americans can poke into.</span></p> <p><span>The essentially British Shawcross adopted the United States, and his experience with <i>Sideshow</i> hardened an already-suspicious nature.  Disturbed by President Carter's recent call for increased CIA activities, he declared that the Freedom of Information Act--the lifeblood of his work--must be broadened.  Angered by the Supreme Court's decision to keep Kissinger's memoirs under wraps in the sacred tombs of the Library of Congress, he hopes that other people will do for the rest of Kissinger's work what he did for Cambodia.</span></p> <p><span>When Shawcross spoke this week to a crowd at the Kennedy School, a few in the audience nodded off, bored by the author's lengthy textual analysis of <i>White House Years.</i>  If Shawcross displayed his wit at times, there was none of the emotion that the crowd had come to see.  Shawcross read whole passages, compared them to others and concluded that Kissinger doesn't always tell the truth.  Kissinger, his speech told us, is a target it will take more than one <i>Sideshow</i> to uncover.  Shawcross realizes this and he goes about his task ponderously, like a coach looking at the films, shaking his head and stopping at every frame to find out where the mistake was made.  He shudders when he talks about former President Gerald R. Ford's promise that Kissinger would be secretary of state if he were in the White House.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>T IS a frustrating task, for Shawcross has seen the American system at its most perverted.  Willie Shawcross went to Washington and to Phnom Penh as an outsider, trying to find out what the hell was going on.  Eight years later Shawcross has seen the guts of our political system turned inside out, pock-marked by the Cambodian experience and the work of some not-so-moral men.  Shawcross has gone back to Washington to produce a series of long articles on the current situation in Cambodia for <i>The Post;</i> \"it's hard to walk away from Cambodia,\" he admits.  But the endless work, he adds quickly, is never boring, only depressing.  \"Cambodia was not a mistake; it was a crime,\" Shawcross writes at the end of <i>Sideshow.</i>  \"If the world is diminished by the experience,\" as Shawcross's last sentence tells us, the author's world--and ours--was opened wide.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Hufstedler Meets Washington | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Long before the House of Representatives passed legislation authorizing the creation of the Department of Education, the rumors flew hot and heavy in Washington.  President Carter, education insiders believed, would name someone with experience in state education programs to head the department--someone like former New Mexico Gov. Jerry Apodaca, a Chicano, or Mary F. Berry, under secretary in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW), a Black woman.</span></p> <p><span>Others, including Congressional liaisons in Washington's community of education lobbies, were certain that Carter would call on a managerial figure to oversee the new bureaucracy, the second cabinet agency he had created during his tenure.  When Carter finally announced his choice--Shirley M. Hufstedler--an appelate court judge from California who was well known in legal circles but unfamiliar to educators--everybody was surprised, some were shocked and all were quick to offer an opinion.</span></p> <p><span>Most surprised of all those involved was Hufstedler herself.  When the White House was checking into Hufstedler's background, the 54-year old judge was on vacation in the hinterlands of Nepal, conquering yet another stretch of the Himalayas.  When administration officials contacted Hufstedler upon her return to the United States, she assumed they wanted to talk legal shop.  But when the officials suggested that Hufstedler take the 13th chair in the Carter cabinet, she was taken aback.  But now, almost four months since her December 6 inauguration as the nation's first Secretary of Education, Shirley Hufstedler is too busy to even think about hiking in Nepal.</span></p> <p><span>Buried in her fourth floor office in the far reaches of Federal Office Building No. 6, hidden from view by the endless expanse of her desk, Hufstedler is not what one would expect but already she looks at home.  Many predict that she would not get comfortable so quickly.  Coming from neither the education nor bureaucratic worlds, Hufstedler was an outsider in professions where people like to take orders from insiders.  Because Hufstedler was not clearly associated with the interests of primary or higher education, people on both ends of the spectrum were angry about Carter's choice.</span></p> <p><span>The Department of Education, after all, had only squeeked by the House by 14 votes and in the opinion of many, as one Congressman bluntly put it, Carter's support for it represented \"a political payoff in every sense of the word.\"  Then candidate Carter had picked up the first-ever endorsement of a presidential candidate from the National Education Association (NEA), the nation's most influential lobby for primary education, in return for his promise to build the department.  Those who represented post-secondary education interests feared that, given the NEA's vital role in establishing the department and a Secretary who came from the primary sector, higher education's pleas might be ignored.  Carter had to avoid alienating the NEA, however, which saw the Department as a down-payment for a 1980 endorsement.  In the end, he picked the wisest and most politically expedient course--nominating an effective, respected public figure whose background was solid enough to arouse interest but vague enough to seem fair to all concerned.</span></p> <p><span>For Hufstedler, as lobbyists in Washington point out, the first few months of her job demanded an acute awareness of the implications of even minor decisions coupled with a firm resolve to get the department off on the right foot.  As the newest kid on the block, Hufstedler would have to hold her ground, ready to fight for her portion of the federal turf--money and manpower that other agencies would not relinquish without a struggle.  Meanwhile, she had to avoid getting tangled up in the nuances of bureaucratic affairs that threatened to ground her well-laid plans.</span></p> <p><span>With the first of many legislative chores--preparing and presenting the department's 1981 budget for the Congress--behind her,' Hufstedler seems to have settled well into her new role.  \"The difficulty,\" the 5 ft. 2-in. charcoal-haired Hufstedler says as she sits on a couch in her office, \"is that all of these things have to be done at the same time.\" But, she insists, \"we're not having any trouble putting it together beyond the routine things.  It takes time to move people from one building to another,\" she explains.</span></p> <p><span>Hufstedler has labored under less-than-ideal circumstances, trying to coordinate 152 separate programs, many of which (131) come from the old Office of Education in HEW but some drawn from departments as diverse as Labor, Agriculture, Defense and Justice.  With employees under no less than 14 different roofs and headquarters shared by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Hufstedler's task would have confounded even the most experienced of Washington hands.  Her critics say she had been slow to reform the bureaucracy, but Hufstedler faced with the unpleasant task of unraveling a third of HEW, perhaps the largest bureaucracy in the world, has done admirably.  \"Nobody can say she isn't trying,\" says one higher-up from HEW.</span></p> <p><span>In what friends say is typical behavior, Hufstedler downplays any personal success she's had, saying that some \"extraordinary and gifted people from inside the bureaucracy and out have aided her efforts.\"  She smiles and puffs on a cigarette.  \"It isn't as if I'm trying to be a do-it-yourselfer,\" she explains.  \"On the contrary, I've had plenty of help.\"  Hufstedler deals firmly yet succinctly with critics' worries.  Of the department's 17,000 employees, 11,000 work in American schools overseas, she says.  Most of the department's new employees are drawn from old bureaucracies, she adds, noting that, when it's all said and done, the department will employ fewer people than were employed in the programs it inherits.  \"It's not a huge sprawling bureaucracy at all,\" she insists.</span></p> <p><span>When Carter formally signed the Department into law, many critics warned that the department, like its cousin the Department of Energy (DOE--the new department will simply be ED)--would have terrible growing pains.  \"The department will spend about two years thrashing around trying to figure out which end is up,\" a spokesman for the American Federation of Teachers, the group which lobbied hardest against the department's creation, predicted.  Hufstedler dismisses such warnings and points to the difference between the DOE experience and her own.  The issues surrounding energy, she says, are \"set before a bewildering array of Congressional Committees within whom the Department of Energy had to deal.  That's not the situation at all,\" says Hufstedler, who calls her department's set of issues \"much more discrete.\"</span></p> <p><span>In first exposure to a new environment, like any good judge, Hufstedler has made effective use of precedent.  As a former lawyer--Hufstedler spent ten years with her husband's Los Angeles, Ca. firm of Beardsley, Hufstedler and Kemble before she began her rise in the California judiciary--Hufstedler says she is used to such interrogation.  \"I've been taking appeals for many, many years,\" says Hufstedler, whose record as a judge caused President Ford to consider her carefully when he looked for someone to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas in 1975.  \"To be sure,\" Hufstedler adds, quickly, \"the setting is somewhat different, but the process is in reality very similar.\"</span></p> <p><span>Many questioned the need for a separate department of education when Carter first proposed it, saying that it was an unnecessary addition to the bureaucracy the president had already promised to trim.  But Hufstedler, speaking in measured tones, makes a good case for a unique, important role for her agency.  \"Undiluted by competing interest,\" education is brought promptly in front of the President and his Cabinet, she says.  \"In the various scattered programs in the huge agency of HEW,\" Hufstedler argues, the Secretary and his/her staff, distracted by different kinds of priorities, didn't have the necessary time to coordinate education programs.  The new Department, Hufstedler believes, presents \"an opportunity to make coherent programs that rather lived a life of their own in earlier incarnations of the Office of Education.\"</span></p> <p><span>Hufstedler promises there will be no single spokesman for the interest of higher education--her own experience in the field, aside from passing work on law school curriculum, was limited to serving as a trustee for Occidental College and the California Institute of Technology--but says her efforts will be supported by those below.  Hufstedler will be joined by the retiring Chancellor of the University of California at Berkeley, Albert H. Bowker, who will be assistant secretary for post-secondary education.  Bowker, whose long experience in higher education, particularly with larger institutions, bodes well for university interests.</span></p> <p><span>But, the Secretary warns, education cannot be seen as isolated processes on different levels.  \"It's foolish to talk about institutions of post-secondary education\" without thinking about the sources of those institution's students\", Hufstedler says with conviction.  \"One addresses the issues, therefore, not simply in isolation but as a part of the full set of issues and problems that affect American education at all levels.\"</span></p> <p><span>Hufstedler believes that good education policies can only be fashioned if there is constant communication and input from all concerned groups.  \"Students, of course, should and do have a very lively voice in the affairs of post-secondary education and their views should be heard,\" she says, adding tactfully, \"They're not always right but they're by no means always wrong either.\"</span></p> <p><span>Hufstedler has not abandoned her strongly liberal recored on the bench as a champion of the rights of women and minorities.  \"Educational equity for women in all phases is about 150 years overdue,\" she says, voice rising in support of the principles embodied in Title IX, which guarantees proportionally equal expenditures for men's and women's athletic programs.</span></p> <p><span>Moving from Title IX, Hufstedler discusses her views about the federal government's relations with private educational institutions; \"Where federal involvement is necessary,\" she has said, \"our goals should be maximum efficiency and cooperation, minimum disruption and domination.\" Sitting atop the bureaucratic tentacles, she reiterates that view, promising that the federal role in control of education, despite warnings from President Bok and others, will not increase because decision-making has been centralized in the new department.</span></p> <p><span>The pressure on the public treasuries is such, she warns, that an increase in federal funds to private institutions is unlikely in the near future.  Correspondingly, Hufstedler takes a pragmatic tack, revealing the common sense judgement her associates commend.  \"People want the federal role to increase all over the place when it comes to the matter of having federal funds that can be directed by the universities and colleges,\" she says.  \"In short, what a lot of people want is perfectly human--'please send me a check but no strings.\" Well, you can't have it both ways.\"</span></p> <p><span>On the other gnawing issues of concern in higher education, Hufstedler, heretofore vaguer in conversations with the press, chooses words and plans that belie the fact that, prior to December, she had little if any exposure to such issues.  For the next decade, the \"biggest single problem facing post-secondary education is demographics,\" she says, noting that the age cohort that would ordinarily be headed to college \"has diminished drastically;\" some estimate it will decline nationally by 20 per cent in the next decade.  Small liberal arts colleges will only survive if they redefine their missions or join in consortia with others faced with similar woes.  If Hufstedler's refreshing idealism is foreign to Washington, she is also realistic.  \"There are a number of different ways in which institutions can survive--but not all of them are going to,\" she admits.</span></p> <p><span>Coupled with demographics, inflation has had severe effect on private institutions of higher education and is reaching down into federal student aid programs.  Like any good school teacher, she warns that people must be disciplined but are nonetheless entitled to the rights of an education.  \"The effort of any overall financial aid package should be to provide enough financial aid so that young people are not foreclosed by reasons of financial need from going to college,\" she says.  Hufstedler feels that the national direct student loan program, which has allowed families boasting large annual incomes to seek help must be remodelled, because it is \"utterly senseless to provide a financial bonanza to people who can afford to send their young people to college.\" She reiterates her position that default rates on student loans must be cut dramatically, and supports the administration's proposal to cut back about $250 million in student aid in fiscal 1981.  The cut, slated for the Basic Educational Opportunity Grant program, she asserts, means only a \"very modest\" per student loss but, because the program applies to so many students, will yield a large overall savings to be budget-conscious government.  Already, Hufstedler explains, the department is hard at work on a simplified application form for financial aid which will tie together existing programs that have heretofore required different paperwork.</span></p> <p><span>In discussing the problems facing post-graduate education, Hufstedler again mixes pragmatism with an ear for innovation.  \"The Secretary of Education cannot have significant impact on the job market,\" she says, but she can try to create opportunities for younger faculty.  By getting senior faculty to take leaves in the government and the private sector, Hufstedler reasons, \"you will create opportunities for young faculty\" and students who are interested in academic careers, may not hesitate to continue working for Ph. D's.  But, Hufstedler warns, a person who is simply in search of the monetary rewards will always suffer from disappointment.  \"The priorities and needs of the government, technological change, and economic conditions can always render obsolete the value of whatever kind of education you have,\" she cautions, \"But the fact that you have that education may provide you with the intellectual flexibility to adapt  yourself as the needs of the country change.\"</span></p> <p><span>Shirley Hufstedler is learning to adapt to the changing requirements of her environment.  With the initial building stages of the Department of Education well under way and seemingly in control, Hufstedler has  already come a long way from the babe-in-the-wooods stage that many predicted she might languish in for the balance of her career.  The bureaucractic teeth Hufstedler has pulled thus far, as she readily admits, are just the beginnings of the business of being a Cabinet secretary.  With any luck and agood deal of support from below, Hufstedler may defy the experts and the critics and be the outsider that makes the insiders listen and the federal bureaucracy work.<c><cred>Crimson<r>Robert O.

{"title": "The Anderson Deference | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>M</b>ULTIPLYING on campuses from Cambridge to Madison, the big red-and-white buttons glint like badges of honor.  They attest to the wearer's rare intellectual discernment in recognizing the merit of Rep. John B. Anderson (R-Ill.).  The Anderson fan knows he is showing unusual judgement and independent-mindedness because every major media commentator has told him so.  Numerous quotations from favorable reviews decorate the Illinois Republican's leaflets as if they were ads for a new movie or bestseller; one expects to read, \"compelling... I couldn't put him down'--James Reston\" or \"the sleeper of the season...****'--Joseph Kraft.\"</span></p> <p><span>When these commentators try to gauge whether Anderson's support is a \"movement\" that might fire an independent race after the GOP rejects him, they sometimes compare student enthusiasm for him to past surges for former Senator Eugene McCarthy and Sen. George S. McGovern (D--S.D.).  But in the absence of a burning emotional issue like Vietnam, the Anderson campaign is distinguished less by moral fervor than by intellectual smugness.  There is a second anti-draft candidate today, but the attention he attracts is due too much to the magic of his name with the sub-rational masses, while Anderson's charm lies in a novel new variety of common sense which, we are led to believe, is best appreciated by the elite.</span></p> <p><span>Sen. Edward M. Kennedy may be the more consistent liberal, but some of Kennedy's natural constituents, have been won over by Anderson's superior facility in articulating answers to questions offered by respectful reporters.  Besides, a fleeting appearance on <i>Saturday Night Live</i> and a starring role in <i>Doonesbury</i> have helped legitimize on campuses the improbable phenomenon of moderate-chic.  Above all, an unseemly air of sordidness stalks the Massachusetts Democrat.  John B. Anderson, if you please, is in good taste.  Unhappily for him, this quality is not sufficient to infuse his candidacy with the messianic sense of mission an independent campaign needs to take off.</span></p> <p><span>A platform of unconventional but straight-forward ideas might do the trick, however, and it is as the generator of just such original notions that the press hails Anderson.  This image had been nurtured by, among other, <i>The New York Times,</i> which--since its near-endorsement January 13--has boosted him when it can, choosing the day of the Massachusetts primary to print the text of his basic speech with a picture of him campaigning in Boston.  From its feature headlined \"Anderson:  Bartering Ideas for Votes\" to the Tom Wicker column, \"Idea Man From Illinois,\" the theme is the same.  Oddly enough, the fresh ideas writers generally cite to bear out the thesis can be counted on the thumbs of one hand:  the 50-50 gas tax plan.  Otherwise, Anderson's campaign is rather unimaginative.  Even the slogans are remarkably unoriginal:  \"Why Not the Best?\" is borrowed from the incumbent, and \"The Anderson Difference\" echoes a commercial for Anacin.</span></p> <p><span><b>B</b>UT ANDERSON is no pain reliever.  HE prides himself on demanding the American people sacrifice in order to overcome a \"vile and ruthless enemy\":  what he calls \"our excessive dependence on foreign oil.\"  After tediously elaborating the magnitude of this familiar threat, he finally presents his one bold idea; one which also belies his reputation for Emersonian \"common sense and plain dealing.\" On the face of it, raising further the price of gasoline is an approach to energy-induced inflation that has little in common with common sense.  Since the idea is not down-to-earth, Anderson is forced to appeal to an academic galaxy of stars from Harvard, Stanford, M.I.T., Wharton, Princeton, Georgetown, Michigan, even \"Michael Evans of Evans Economics\" himself...it is a crowded stump speech.</span></p> <p><span>Anderson's tax package is an intricate scheme rather than plain dealing; the convoluted economic reasoning behind it falls apart under examination.  To offset the impact of higher gas prices, on the cost of living, the plan would return most of the revenue to consumers through Social Security tax cuts and increases in benefits for the elderly.  Certainly, if the government taxed the consumer 50 cents for every gallon and then gave the same consumber back 50 cents for every gallon he purchased, and if the consumer then used the 50 cents to pay for the tax, the net effect would be nil--not only on inflation, but on conservation.  As Anderson explains, \"The whole object of the exercise would be to make people drive less and use their money for other things.\"  In other words, more money would chase these \"other things,\" amounting to still another inflationary impulse.  This new problem would be alleviated if the production of other things rose commensurately because of the tax credits Anderson would give business.  But he is counting on these merely to \"offset the higher cost of motor fuel\" so that \"companies would not have to pass the 50-cent fuel tax on to consumers in the form of higher prices.\"  Companies won't <i>have</i> to pass on higher costs, but if they can, they will.  The upshot:  yet one more twist in the inflationary spiral.</span></p> <p><span>While Anderson's program at least tries to help the retired and working people it hurts, it does nothing for the unemployed.  Plain-speaking Sen. Sam Hayakawa (D-Cal.) was castigated for saying that the poor don't need to drive to work, not having jobs; Anderson implicitly makes the same assumption.  Gasoline rationing would be the most fair and direct approach to short-run conservation--true plain dealing.</span></p> <p><span>In its \"Why Not the Best?\"  editorial, <i>The New York Times</i> notes, \"Edward Kennedy contends that America can conserve its way out of the noose, with tax credits and subsidies for insulation and energy savings.  Such policies would help--eventually.  But what about the three or five or more years until then?\"  Kennedy's answer, of course, is a combination of rationing and price controls.  This program has the advantage of guaranteeing results.  The best evidence that Anderson's plan wouldn't achieve its conservation goals is that he is promoting the same size tax now as gas heads toward $1.50 a gallon that he did last year when it was $1.00 a gallon.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>NDERSON'S OPPOSITION to price controls on oil is dictated by an attitude toward business interests that might be called \"the Anderson deference.\" In this respect, he is no different from the other Republicans.  At the end of his basic speech he acknowledges that in the future, \"our best bet is conservation through more fuel-efficient cars, homes and factories.  Conservation in its truest sense does not even have to mean sacrifice; it can actually save us money.\" Accomplishing the desirable levels of efficiency in transportation, construction and industry is out of the hands of the average consumer.  But Anderson's conservative reluctance to let the federal government spend money on massive programs or mandate standards for business prevents him from advocating the steps necessary to what he realizes is the only long-run solution.  Like Jimmy Carter, he is therefore reduced to asking sacrifices of those who are already sacrificing.</span></p> <p><span>Anderson is indeed a liberal Republican.  Rather than pushing him to the far right, his Evangelical Christianity has brought him an admirable sensitivity expressed in his valuable efforts on behalf of civil rights and freedom of choice.  He has spoken out forcefully on the Equal Rights Amendment, prayer in schools and gun control.</span></p> <p><span>But Anderson upholds business interests on the issues most important to them.  He says he endorses \"a shelter for capital gains with a credit on gross income, and permitting a more rapid acceleration of depreciation on capital spending.\" His tireless support of nuclear power includes a vote as recent as last year to continue the plutonium breeder program.  He has voted against consumer interests in oil price controls, the Consumer Protection Agency and the Consumer Cooperative Bank.  Labor he has opposed by voting to cut back the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and to deny black lung benefits to coal miners, food stamps to the families of strikers and extension of the minimum wage law to nearly a million retail and service employees.  Labor also hasn't profitted from his votes against common-situs picketing and labor law reform.</span></p> <p><span>Anderson has stood up well to Carter's most recent war rhetoric, but when his vote for the neutron bomb is added to his pro-business record, it is clear why the Republicans have tolerated Anderson as their House Conference Chairman and why the Chicago Tribune endorsed him as a candidate in harmony with modern conservatism.\"  Less evident is why, especially after an unimpressive showing in Wisconsin yesterday, Anderson should contemplate an eveutual independent campaign.  His ideas simply are not distinctive enough; he is squarely in the mainstream of American party politics.  Missing is the kind of ideological justification present in the campaigns of Henry Wallace to the left or George to the right.</span></p> <p><span>Because \"the Anderson difference\" is not all that different from a traditional moderate stance, the media may pay him more respect then they traditionally accord independents.  For this reason Anderson may be tempted to take the plunge and for the same reason he should hold back:  he wouldn't win, but he might throw the election to former California Gov. Ronald Reagan.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Bondage and Discipline | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>S</b>PEAKING with the tepid fervor of a Calvinist who has repressed even the heat of his Puritanism, President Carter last Friday solemnly painted his own vision of how the nation can at last conquer inflation and recapture past economic glory.  It is a narrow vision, with no bold initiatives to harness the energy and resources of the American people.  Instead, it demands they submit passively to \"pain\" and \"discipline.\"  Fifteen times those dolorous syllables rolled from the President's pursed lips.</span></p> <p><span>The question, as always, is who will suffer the pain, who will discipline whom.  Carter's answer exhibits his bondage to impotent ideas and powerful interests.  His proposals are designed for an old-fashioned inflation caused by excessive demand.  This approach allows him to administer the pain to those members of the public least able to fight back, while avoiding any assault on preserves of corporate power actually responsible for much of the rising costs behind the current inflation.</span></p> <p><span>Credit controls and a balanced budget are Carter's methods of limiting demand.  The balanced budget is a fetish likely to accomplish little.  Carter himself points out that every budget but one since 1961 has run a deficit--yet we managed to sustain minimal inflation during many of those years.  The $13 billion Carter wants to cut from the budget--even the $18 billion in cuts he mistakenly promised his national television audience--would not significantly cut inflation.  John Kenneth Galbraith, Warburg Professor of Economics Emeritus, has said that \"in a two-to-three-trillion dollar a year economy, it is hard to see what differences these cuts will make.\"</span></p> <p><span>The cuts will, however, make a significant difference for those who lose needed programs.  Carter, prepared to accept the political benefits of espousing a balanced budget, does not have the self-discipline to disclose where most of the cuts will fall until after primaries in the urban centers of Illinois and New York.  Inflation adviser Alfred Kahn implicitly admitted as much in his response to questions about the delay:  \"I'm not privy to political decisions made at the White House.\"</span></p> <p><span>Still, many of the targeted areas have been revealed unofficially or can be guessed from comments by Congressional budget conferees.  Several job programs are due to be reduced or dropped.  School lunches and health care for children will likely be cut back.  Energy and food aid for the poor will suffer.  Carter is presenting large savings in federal aid to states and cities with typical sleight of hand.  He intends to eliminate the states' $1.7 billion portion of general revenue-sharing, about half of which goes to education.  Since Illinois, New York and some other states pass their share on to localities, the administration said Monday it would seek several hundred million dollars in compensation for cities and counties that would be hurt the most.  But with his other hand, Carter is expected to pull back $1 billion in anti-recession aid to cities and another $265 million in mass transit grants.  Local governments should not celebrate too soon.</span></p> <p><span>If reducing the deficit is a political imperative, there are alternatives to disciplining the young, the elderly, the unemployed, and the residents of declining cities.  Sen. Edward M. Kennedy '54 (D-Mass.) wants to eliminate tax writeoffs for intangible oil drilling costs and for accelerated depreciation of high-income housing, saving $4.5 billion.  He also feels we could maintain our defense without a new nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, Rep. James Shannon (D-Mass) suggests cutting back tax credits for money American companies pay foreign governments.  Rep. David Obey (D-Wis) recommends raising the 46-per-cent top corporate tax rate to 48 per cent again, as well as imposing a 5 per cent surcharge on individual incomes above $50,000.</span></p> <p><span>\"Our whole society,\" Carter admonished, \"the entire American family, must try harder than ever to live within its means.\"  His proposal to withhold income taxes from dividends and interest, as is now done with wages, is a fair step in the right direction.  Otherwise, his measures tend to demand sacrifices in the common cause by those who are already struggling merely to obtain, at inflated prices, the necessities of life.  Closing tax loopholes is the more humane route.  Last year, profits for 1200 American industrial corporations, banks and utilities surveyed by <i>Business Week,</i> rose an average of 22 per cent over 1978.  The loosest belts should be tightened first.</span></p> <p><span><b>C</b>ARTER'S REGIMEN of pain and discipline is designed to ease inflation by slowing the economy, at the price of lost jobs and government programs.  But he is accepting this price with little hope of achieving anything but the appearance of action.  A \"senior Administration official\" told <i>The New York Times,</i> \"The balancing of the budget will not have an immediate impact on inflation, nor will the other actions.\"  He said the measures were directed at the \"long-term aspects of inflation.\"</span></p> <p><span>Yet Robert Russell, director of the Council on Wage and Price Stability, warned before Carter spoke that double-digit inflation would continue through the 1980s.</span></p> <p><span>Carter's other proposals are destined to be as ineffective as his budget cuts.  The credit controls leave the bulk of consumer credit--borrowing for homes, cars and other durable items--untouched.  Carter will require smaller companies to report price changes to the Council on Wage and Price Stability, while he is also going to raise the standards for pay increases.  The latter move may be justified, but it is hardly a blow against inflation.  In addition, the Council will hire more staffers.  As Alfred Kahn concedes, \"the wage and price program is always a kind of marginal thing.\"</span></p> <p><span>The oil import fee, amounting to ten cents a gallon of gasoline, will wipe out any gains from the rest of Carter's program by raising the consumer price index by more than half of 1 per cent, by administration estimates.  Called a \"conservation fee,\" it is really a budget-balancing hedge against possible Congressional failures to ratify the president's spending cuts.  In this case, it may face legal challenge because the 1962 law authorizing import fees stipulates they cannot be used as a revenue source.</span></p> <p><span>The final contradictory element in Carter's program is his pledge to \"provide tax relief to encourage investment\" once the budget has been balanced.  This intent meshes poorly with the administration's stated disappointment that \"Retail sales have remained strong,\" \"Employment is still up,\" and \"The widely expected recession has not materialized.\"</span></p> <p><span>Apart from the obvious political considerations, the administration privately anticipated the only real effect of the program would be psychological.  Inflation feeds on expectations of future inflations, so a program that looked like it would work--could work.  Thus Fed Chairman Paul A. Volcker comments on the limited credit controls, \"What we're talking about is not a huge part of the credit scene, but it's a showy and symbolic one.\"  John L. Murray, president of Universal Foods, sums up the general business reaction to Carter's program when he says it is \"essentially symbolic, and it's too late for symbols.  Something more substantial would be in order.\"  The <i>Wall Street Journal</i> acidly characterizes Carter's prescription as \"Have another arsenic.\"  Most importantly, the financial markets have not responded as hoped.</span></p> <p><span>The kind of policy Carter is pursuing can only succeed if he does more than, in the <i>Journal's</i> words, \"trim the fingernails of the federal budget.\"  But budget cuts deep enough to satisfy business would come at too high a human cost and would very likely bring a depression.  A new direction is necessary:  Carter should impose price controls immediately.  Then the task of raising output by putting Americans back to work can begin.  Programs to make the nation more energy-efficient are the best way in the long run to stop inflation, by improving productivity and lessening dependence on foreign oil.  This entails efforts to revamp buildings, industry and transit which would employ many more people--and which would signal the end of bondage to outmoded economic ideas.  President Carter can use his discipline on those, like the oil companies, who could use it, and give the rest of us a shot at the Puritan work ethic.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Common-Sense Economics | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b>NTERRUPTING President Carter's televised talk on the economy last Friday night, a home appliance commercial alerted Americans to \"National Hoover Week.\"  Carter's words underscored the sponsor's message.  Unlike Hoover, however, this president is perhaps overly reconciled to his historic role.  \"Depression,\" Carter assures us. \"is just around the corner.\"</span></p> <p><span>President Carter's choice of recessionary tactics to chip away at 18 per cent inflation is both cruel and futile.  It is cruel to propose credit controls and budget cuts aimed at bringing down prices by throwing more Americans out of work.  The program is doubly cruel because the budget will hit those who are already victims of hard times.  Expenditures targeted for the axe include energy assistance for the poor, health care money for children, aid to the cities, revenue sharing--in great part educational funds--for states, cost-of-living adjustments for food-stamp recipients, and spending for public works and youth job programs.  The Pentagon is dodging serious scrutiny.</span></p> <p><span>At the same time, this display of fiscal firmness is failing to impress its intended audience.  The program's goal is to prove to the business world that Carter is man enough to grit his teeth and make the helpless bite the bullet--thereby reversing self-fulfilling inflationary expectations.  But the consensus on Wall Street is that not enough old people will freeze, too few children will go hungry and, in short, stricter discipline is necessary.</span></p> <p><span>With the psychological thrust of the plan blunted, very little remains.  Even the administration does not anticipate the budget cuts will reduce the cost of living in the near future.  The credit controls apply to a fraction of consumer borrowing too small to be significant.  And the 10 cents a gallon fee on gasoline will actually boost the consumer price index an estimated seven tenths of one per cent.  Carter seeks to show voters he is doing something now; they will feel the pain later, the benefits never.</span></p> <p><span>The economists Carter is listening to, are as confused as the public.  They have had their chance to manipulate the economy using indirect tactics based on complex theories.  The time has come for direct action.  A wage-price freeze will cut short the inflationary spiral--but it will only work as a breathing space in which to restructure the economy on sounder foundations.</span></p> <p><span>Permanent price controls on oil will stop profiteering by American-based distributors for OPEC.  An end to the current crazy policy of high interest rates will put home costs back in touch with reality.  Pruning subsidies to agribusiness will yield cheaper food.  National health insurance coverage will calm fevered medical costs.  Above all, we need to outgrow our dependence on foreign oil.  Shifting money from the war budget to mass transit and energy efficiency programs will at once create more jobs and lower costs.  We ought to be able to attack inflation without inviting depression.  Economics isn't so complicated if you set out to help the average American.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Dangerously Naive' | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>To the Editors of The Crimson:</b></span></p> <p><span>Your March 20th editorial entitled \"Common-sense Economics\" is one of the shoddiest commentaries which The Crimson has printed in many months.  The editorial is not merely internally inconsistent, but the remedies it proposes are dangerously naive.</span></p> <p><span>The inconsistency arises when the piece criticizes Carter for using \"indirect tactics based on complex theories\" to improve the health of the economy, and then chides him for not using such tactics adequately.</span></p> <p><span>More serious are most of the \"remedies\" to combat recession which the editorial proposes, namely a wage-price freeze, permanent controls on oil prices, \"an end to the current crazy policy of high interest rates,\" cutting subsidies to agribusiness to \"yield cheaper food,\" national health insurance to \"calm fevered medical costs,\" and a shift from spending on the war budget to such items as mass transit and energy conservation.</span></p> <p><span>I am convinced that less military spending is essential, and that emphasis on mass transit systems and energy conservation are highly desirable, but the reasons for this conviction are not economic but philosophical.</span></p> <p><span>A wage-price freeze would be difficult to administer, as firms and individuals seek to bend the rules.  Thus new labor contracts will raise non-cash benefits, suppliers will demand cash prepayment, and unrecorded payments for goods or to workers will rise.</span></p> <p><span>A wage-price also undermines the role of price as a signal of change.  Growing industries such as coal or computers or home insulation would soon be short of new labor because the freeze would prevent them from raising wages to attract workers from declining or stagnant industries.  Oil-using industries, facing rising prices <b>abroad,</b> would have to pay more for oil.  Are they to go broke?  Or again, suppose there is a poor world harvest, so that at current prices there is an excess demand for grain.  How is this grain to be allocated if not by price?  Another administrative machinery?</span></p> <p><span>Finally, a wage-price freeze, if temporary, would have little or no effect on inflation.  The inflationary spurt after Nixon lifted his price controls in 1974 simply reflected pent-up pressures.  The freeze did little to dampen expectations of inflation, and in the views of some economists may ultimately have led to even higher price levels!  A more permanent freeze would have the defects mentioned earlier.  It is not clear that such a system of permanent administrative price setting--approximating the system in a centrally planned economy--would be desirable, despite the many drawbacks of a market-based economy.</span></p> <p><span>Permanent controls on oil prices would soon imply either subsidising imports or foregoing imports entirely--for who would sell to a country which is not prepared to pay the market price for oil.  Such price controls, by keeping the price of oil low, would not reduce domestic consumption, hence rationing would be needed.  The equity of this depends entirely on how ration coupons are distributed.  For efficiency ration coupons should be sold, and this would raise the price of oil (including coupons) to at least free market levels.  If oil companies make excessive profits, then it seems more sensible to tax the profits.</span></p> <p><span>Interest rates only seem high because they largely reflect inflation.  A $10,000 6-month treasury bill currently yields about 14 per cent.  But with inflation at about 15 per cent this represents a negative real rate of return on buying such a T-bill.  This diminishes the incentives to save.  With less saving where are resources to come from for investment (Including housebuilding)?</span></p> <p><span>A national health insurance system might cut<b>private</b> medical costs, but would certainly raise the total expense of the medical system.  If one need not pay anything towards medicine or treatment (apart form an obligatory tax), one is likely to use medical services more, and hence more doctors, drugs, and facilities would be required.  There is no clear incentive here for \"calming fevered medical costs.\" <b>Jonathan Haughton</b></span></p>"}

Orren left an associate professorship in the Government Department.</span></p> <p><span>When Orren takes to the podium in the fall, he will have plenty of stories to tell--like the one about a campaign that started out invincible, soon found it had more Achilles heels that a baseball team, and finally, last week, began to click again.</span></p> <p><span>After a New Hampshire drubbing, after failing in the South and in Illinois, Kennedy still had the resolve to continue--it wasn't just a line.  It became an important issues crusade, standing up for positions that needed to be expressed,\" Orren said.</span></p> <p><span>But crusades, especially ones down two-to-one in the polls, are never easy.  \"Funds were drying up... half the staff was relieved.  People started doing multiple tasks.\"  In Orren's case that meant training volunteers to poll, instead of hiring outside firms.</span></p> <p><span>\"It was a C-Ration kind of situation, a 'lean and hungry' staff,\" Orren said.  \"We were living off the land in a more guerrilla kind of way.  But then, those kind of campaigns have been successful in recent years.\"</span></p> <p><span>Extra sweat couldn't buy some things.  \"If you want the air time, you have to pay the bill to NBC, and that's it,\" Orren moaned.  But here, too, necessity mothered effort if not invention.  \"When you're rich and fat, sometimes you don't really grovel....  We became far more tenacious about unpaid media,\" Orren, who will teach on the press and politics next year, said.</span></p> <p><span>\"The last week of the New York campaign was beautifully choreographed--the visit to Metropolitan Hospital, the session with the Hasidic Jews, speaking on the same spot in the South Bronx where Carter made his promises four years ago, the visit with Cardinal Cooke.\"</span></p> <p><span>Kennedy staffers shored up another weakness for New York as well, Orren explained.  \"For the first time, we made effective use of surrogates,\" he said, citing endorsements from Carroll O'Connor to Carol Bellamy that paid off on election day.</span></p> <p><span>\"One of our failings was the tendency to have the Senator out on the trail himself, a sort of Lone Ranger--if you have the spotlight on you five, six times a day, it just gets too much.  That's what happened with the Shah statement,\" Orren said.</span></p> <p><span>The list of surrogates didn't include political leaders like New York Gov. Hugh Carey or Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan (D-N.Y.), who urged Kennedy to enter the race last fall.  But Orren says the endorsements will come quicker now that the Bay State senator has some momentum.</span></p> <p><span>\"When you need endorsements the most, they're the hardest to get.  In politics, people are like sniffers--they move the way the tide is going,\" Orren said.</span></p> <p><span>And for now, he adds cheerfully, the tide is going Kennedy's way.</span></p> <p><span>\"For a long time the name of the game was survival--we were treading water, and we didn't know if we were going to drown.  But we came out of the Hudson River, and now we're doing the crawl, not the backstroke.\"</span></p> <p><span>Some observers, including those looking on from the White House, called Kennedy's New York win a local phenomenon.  Orren, who's been polling in the Empire State and elsewhere, disagreed.  \"It's an expression of strong disapproval of the President from people who want to send him a message,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>Along with Jews upset over Carter's handling of a United Nations vote on West Bank settlements, there was also \"the vote upstate, the vote in Polish wards, the vote among Catholics.\"  And, on the same day, there was the vote in Connecticut.  \"There are two main constituencies, Catholics and Yankees.  Kennedy had not been doing well with those groups, but in Connecticut he ran phenomenally--he won almost every precinct in New Haven,\" Orren said.</span></p> <p><span>The dual wins, however, have not prompted Kennedy to shift his speech writers to drafting his inaugural address.  \"They do demonstrate a greater receptivity to Kennedy, as well as a rebuke to Carter, though,\" Orren said.</span></p> <p><span>Exit polls in New York and Connecticut showed voters trusted Kennedy more, an unusual position for a politician still suffering from a personal image shaped in large part by the accident at Chappaquiddick.</span></p> <p><span>When voters say they trust Kennedy, \"they don't mean he's a person of better character.  I think Carter still beats us on the high moral standards,\" Orren said.  \"Instead, we're getting the professional trust as opposed to the truthfulness, better person aspect,\" he added.</span></p> <p><span>\"There's the contrast--Carter is now on his sixth version of where he stands on the budget.  He's on a roller coaster, lurching from left to right....  People are starting to say, 'I'm not sure I trust Carter.'\"</span></p> <p><span>Orren's polls show \"the public has never believed that Carter is an extremely competent leader.  He was getting some high marks at the height of Iran, mostly for restraint....  But even then, people understood that he had failed his way into that.\"</span></p> <p><span>And with that mistrust of Carter's issue stances and ability, another side of the character issue may be starting to emerge, Orren said.  \"Kennedy has taken his knocks and stood gallantly.  It's the kind of admiration John Anderson is getting so much of on his side of the fence.  You pay your price for a while, but it may end up helping you.\"</span></p> <p><span>Orren's optimism is tempered by reality.  \"Chappaquiddick is not something that's going to disappear....  A certain portion of the population will never vote for Kennedy because he doesn't meet their standards of moral rectitude.</span></p> <p><span>\"If he's going to win, other factors will have to come to dominate,\" Orren predicted.  \"Now you are starting to see people weight those sorts of issues against competency questions....  We haven't had that before--instead there's been intense scrutiny on Ted Kennedy the man.  Up till now, people have been voting up or down on Ted Kennedy's history.\"</span></p> <p><span>Kennedy and his staff made a conscious decision to start stressing the issues, especially stances like gas rationing and wage-price controls where Kennedy stood apart from the President beginning with the early-winter Georgetown speech, Orren said.</span></p> <p><span>\"Earlier on, there had been a lot of general talk about Kennedy being the stronger leader....  There were a lot of position papers and discussion of the issues, but a campaign creates its own emphasis.\"  Kennedy said \"nothing new in the Georgetown speech, except for rationing and wage-price controls We had discussed coming out for those things before, and tried to figure out what the timing was,\" Orren said.</span></p> <p><span>The strategy paid off just in time for Kennedy.  Pointing to California, Pennsylvania, Ohio and New Jersey as must states, Orren predicted the race would probably go down to the last primaries.  Outside factors--especially cross-over voting for Rep. John Anderson (R-Ill.) might affect tomorrow's voting in Wisconsin.  But by the time the race reaches Pennsylvania, it should be a \"showdown,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>\"Pennsylvania was the most important primary in 1976, and it probably will be again in 1980....  There's plenty of time for a very intense campaign.  And the state is fascinating--it is northeastern, but it has lots of rural areas, big cities and many suburbs.  It's a great stage for the showdown.\"</span></p> <p><span>Carter aides said last week that despite the wins in the Northeast, Kennedy was too far behind to ever catch up.  \"It's not all over,\" Orren insisted, adding that the New York results may force Carter out on the campaign trail.</span></p> <p><span>\"He's caught between a rock and a hard place--he said he wouldn't leave the White House until the hostages were free, but he's churning at the bit to be campaigning.  The Rose Garden is starting to get a little bit thorny,\" Orren chuckled.</span></p> <p><span>\"He can't cross Rte. 495 or he's broken his promise to the American public,\" Orren said.  \"We'll see if he edges across the thruway.\"</span></p> <p><span>Despite Carter's promises, Orren said Kennedy staffers would love the chance to confront Carter head-on away from the White House.  \"It's very hard to wage a campaign as a monologue....  You've got to deal with a whole pack of reporters, and you're out there all alone, so they're all out after you,\" Orren said.</span></p> <p><span>And should Carter venture forth, his appearance will win votes for his challenger, pollster Orren predicts.  \"If Carter gets out there, people will see this cold cucumber of a guy, and they'll see Ted Kennedy as just the opposite.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"We haven't done enough to communicate early on a sense of biography,\" Orren said.  \"The public knows all the bad things about Ted Kennedy, but they don't have the good sides fleshed out in their minds--the fact that he is a good family man, he has a great sense of humor, a zest for life, a wide circle of friends.\"  In contrast, Carter \"has no sense of humor.  He's Spartan, he has a contempt for politics, a narrow circle of friends,\" Orren said.</span></p> <p><span>Right now, things are brightening in the Kennedy camp.  \"I tried to talk with the people in fundraising thise week, and I couldn't get through.  That's a good sign,\" Orren said.  But the real message of the last week's primaries is that the election is far from in the bag for any candidate.  \"One half the delegates have been selected.  Look how tumultous it's been up to now,\" Orren said.  \"Who is to think the second half would be any less wild?\"</span></p> <p><span><i>The Update Page is an occasional feature of The Crimson that brings up to date people, places and issues The Crimson has covered.</i></span></p> <p><span>\"When you need endorsements the most they're the hardest to get.

Actually, the SSS only takes up about three-quarters of the building's fifth floor, but from all of the yelling out in the streets, you'd think these people owned half the town.</span></p> <p><span>Things at the SSS have been pretty quiet since 1973, when they stopped registering young men for the draft and fired 6900 of the department agency's 7000 employees.  But since President Carter woke up to the Soviet threat--and decided that registering people for the draft not only would show the Kremlin what \"grave consequences\" await it but also might grab him a few primary votes--the people at SSS, all 78 of them who work in the Washington office, have been pretty busy.  After all, it's not every day that you gear up for war.</span></p> <p><span>\"I can understand protesting the draft,\" says SSS spokesman Joan Lamb as she revolves in her chair, \"but not registration.\"  Lamb, who has been touring the area talking to college students, says she can't comprehend how young people make the connection between registration and the actual process of induction.  Lamb smiles.  She studied Russian history in college and understands the nuances of Soviet expansion.  She also has a son who is draft age.</span></p> <p><span>Two blocks down, and four blocks up the hill, Sen. William D.

Proxmire is asking a quivering panel of NSF administrators why their agency spent $35 a day to finance a graduate student's research on \"The Development of Political Institutions in Colorado in the 19th Century\" when a man in Maine spends the same amount to support a family of four.  The NSF people are chewing on their slide rules and muttering about understanding the future in relation to the past.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HESE ARE NOT very opportune times to be looking for spare cash in the halls of Congress.  The pro-registration forces on the House Appropriations Committee--that 54-member panel which recommends who gets what--originally thought they'd just tack the $13 million needed to register 19-and 20-year old men for the draft on to the federal budget.  But the federal budget is having troubles of its own and so they changed their minds, reasoning that they'd just effect a transfer of sorts and move the needed cash from the Department of Defense to the SSS.  At the very least, they said, the SSS would require about $4.7 million to build itself a computerized system so when Armaggedon begins, we can all be there to watch it.</span></p> <p><span>Out on the streets, they're yelling and screaming about civil liberties and stopping militarism but in the Congress, they're really worried about filthy lucre.  And the logistics.  As decision time nears Congressmen begin to realize Carter's plan is a vote gathering blind.  As Ted Kennedy's been saying, one Congressional aide whispers in my ear, why do it if it would only take us an extra 13 days to muster the first 100,000 men needed to fight in North Yemen.  \"The additional step of peacetime registration,\" argues a \"Dear Colleague\" sent out by the small-but growing ranks of Appropriations Committee members who are against Carter's plan, \"is an empty symbol because it adds nothing to the speed of American mobilization in the event of war.\"</span></p> <p><span>But these guys are in the minority.  The fate of the 19- and 20-year old men really lies in the aging and conservative Rep. Jamie R. Whitten (D-Miss.), the chairman of the Appropriations Committee.  It's Congress in action, as Whitten calls up the requested transfer for a vote and then--panicking that his hawkish majority may have crumbled beneath him--shelves his idea for another day.

No student deferments; the only people that are going to miss this one are those in or studying for the ministry and the real objectors--who will have to go work in some kind of socially redeeming job.  \"Don't worry,\" Lamb soothes.  \"If you're in college, you'll be able to finish out the term.  If you're in your senior year, you'll be able to graduate first.\"  And about that figure that 50 per cent will try to go c.o.?

{"title": "Intelligence or Intelligent Policy? | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>President Carter in his State of the Union address encouraged the adoption of a charter for our intelligence agencies to guard against abuses while simultaneously addressing the \"need to remove unwarranted restraints on America's ability to collect intelligence.\"  Congress has now responded with proposals for legislation which provides for reduced congressional oversight of the CIA, the FBI, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the National Security Agency; for court-authorized investigations of Americans in the U.S. who are \"known spies\" (precisely what is a \"known spy\"?); for closure of CIA files to Freedom of Information Act inquiries without need for justification by issues of \"national secuity;\" and for permitting a wide range of \"intelligence operations\" stopping short, it seems, only of assassination.  This last curious phrase raises several interesting general questions:  is there a difference between legitimate intelligence-gathering and \"intelligence operations?\"  And, to what extent can recent foreign policy debacles be attributed to \"intelligence failures\"; that is, to problems of incompleteness or inaccuracy of data?</span></p> <p><span>In the aftermath of the startlingly rapid collapse of the Shah of Iran, images were evoked of a CIA shackled by an overzealous Congress--the latter being depicted as opportunistically demonstrating its \"integrity\" to the post-Watergate cynical American public by raking the CIA over the coals.  But the \"handstied CIA\" explanation was seriously challenged when Jesse J. Leaf, former CIA analyst in Iran, revealed that as early as 1973 CIA operatives cautioned Washington about the vulnerability of the Shah (an act which Leaf alleges cost him his job).  Furthermore, the eventual resurgence of the opposition to the Shah was predicted outside of government circles as early as 1969.  At that time, Hamid Algar, U.C. Berkeley's Iran scholar, ended an analysis of the role of the Muslim clergy in Iranian politics with the prophetic statement, \"When the integrity of the nation is held to be threatened by internal autocracy and foreign hegemony, protests in religious terms will continue to be voiced, and the appeals of men such as Ayatollah Khomeini to be widely heeded.\"  In the imminence of the collapse of the Shah, American government officials stood alone in maintaining that he would weather the storm.</span></p> <p><span>A more convincing explanation of our foreign policy \"failure\" in Iran is that the breakdown occurred not at the level of data-gathering, but in the inhibition of the CIA's ability to execute that broader category of tasks referred to as \"intelligence operations\"--a euphemism for covert interference in and manipulation of political forces in a foreign country.  This inhibition had much less to do with American congressional investigations into CIA abuses than it did with the Shah of Iran's insistence that the CIA not involve itself with opposition political groups, and that all \"intelligence operations\" be conducted through Iran's own SAVAK--an obvious attempt by the Shah to safeguard against any shift in CIA support to the opposition were it to appear at any point that the Shah himself had become \"expendable.\"</span></p> <p><span>No doubt the inability to infiltrate opposition groups in Iran also left the CIA with less than complete data about the inner workings of the revolutionary forces there.  But equally certain is that sufficient public information was available for analysts of Iran in the academic world and elsewhere to anticipate the downfall of the Shah.  It is difficult to escape the conclusion that the U.S. government's persistent refusal to take account of the Iranian opposition expressed its vested interest in denying realities, which stemmed from a prior political decision to promote the Shah as America's \"unconditional ally\" (to use Henry Kissinger's phrase) over and against the protests of his people.</span></p> <p><span>In light of the disastrous impact of such a policy in Iran, it is disturbing to witness that its principles do not seem to have been adequately questioned by policy-makers in Washington.  That this is the case is suggested firstly in the above-mentioned moves of the administration and Congress, which seem determined to restore the CIA's ability to interfere in the internal affairs of other nations under the public rationale of enhancing \"intelligence-gathering\" techniques.</span></p> <p><span>Secondly, the U.S. government's stubborn refusal to deal with opposition groups appears destined for repetition in the case of the Arab-Israeli conflict, where American public officials continue to deny the legitimacy of the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization among Palestinians--again, in contradiction to publicly available facts.  The objections to PLO participation in negotiations--that it is \"terrorist,\" that it denies the right of Israel to exist, that it does not represent Palestinians, but is merely a \"Soviet tool\"--simply do not bear up to scrutiny.  The use of violence against civilians did not prevent our negotiating with the National Liberation Front in Vietnam, nor of recognizing the necessity of bringing Zimbabwean guerrillas into a political settlement in Rhodesia--nor, incidentally, is such an argument invoked against our dealing with Israel, which employs considerable violence against Palestinian and other Arab civilian populations (which accounted, for example, for 2000 Palestinian and Lebanese lives in Israel's 1978 invasion of Lebanon).</span></p> <p><span>Now, the alarming indications are that previous foreign policy blunders are on the way to being repeated--at considerable risks to the civil liberties of Americans, the safety and welfare of peoples of the Middle East, and ultimately to America's broader interests.  However, the basis of this misdirection is not a matter of inadequate data, but involves implicit assumptions about America's global role and definitions of \"national interests\" which guide and direct what policy-makers do with data.  It is these assumptions and definitions, as opposed to methods for gathering intelligence, which may require amendment if we are to avoid future foreign policy disasters.  Above all we need \"intelligence\"--information--far less than we need intelligent policy.</span></p> <p><span><i>George E. Bisharat is a Ph.D. candidate in Anthropology and Middle Eastern Studies.

Otto Kerner Jr. in 1973 for extortion, mail fraud, perjury, conspiracy, and bribery?  Do you care about the trial of former Illinois Gov. Otto Kerner Jr.?  Have you ever heard of former Illinois Gov. Otto Kerner Jr.?</span></p> <p><span>If your answer to any of those questions was \"yes,\" you're probably from Illinois (which, if you're an easterner, is somewhere near Wyoming) and you may be interested enough to read Chicago journalist Robert E. Hartley's book <i>Big Jim Thompson of Illinois,</i> a thorough, but not very revealing biography about Illinois' current Republican governor, more politely known as James R. Thompson (he's about 6 feet-4 inches tall--hence, the nickname).</span></p> <p><span>But what does former Illinois Gov. Otto Kerner Jr.'s trial have to do with Thompson?  It--and the attendant publicity--gave Thompson a big boost in his eventual quest to win the governorship in 1976.  The trial took place in the midst of Thompson's tenure as U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Illinois (which includes Cook County and Chicago), from 1971 through 1975.  In that office, he attracted a great deal of attention for his reputed \"swinging bachelor\" life style--which Hartley says was a misconception--and his method of prosecution:  going after the big names, leaking tantalizing tidbits of information from his office's investigations, and revealing the goings-on at secret grand jury proceedings.</span></p> <p><span>He went after corruption among government officials--especially Democrats, not out of any overwhelming hatred for them, but because, as Hartley observes, most government officials in the northern district of Illinois are Democrats.  His high-profile method worked, and Thompson became a successful prosecutor in terms of convictions and in terms of popularity with the media and the public.</span></p> <p><span>Democrats, however--especially former Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley--did not like him much at all.  As Hartley points out in one of his rare moments of enlightened commentary, Thompson prosecuted and achieved convictions of government officials for such commonplace trivialities as bribery, extortion--part of the politicians' \"unofficial understanding\" of the American political system--and mail fraud \"without the political system stopping him at some point.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>B</b>UT HARTLEY'S superficial treatment of the Kerner case--an event so important to Thompson's career--is a major fault of this book.  It reads too much like an expanded news article.  The short sentences and paragraphs of the journalistic style make for quick reading, but they also give the impression that Hartley does little more than skim the surface of Thompson's career and character.</span></p> <p><span>Furthermore, Hartley emphasizes only the positive aspects of Thompson's career.  Admittedly, his ascendence to the governor's mansion was a phenomenal success story for a relatively young man (41 years old when elected for his first term in 1976).  But Thompson has been the center of controversy since his days as a U.S. attorney.</span></p> <p><span>He was criticized back then for his manipulation of publicity and his liberal granting of immunity to obtain testimony in order to convict.  Usually, the big-name politicians accused of committing offenses like bribery were not those let off the hook.  But Hartley fails to include comments from people critical of Thompson's practices.  Instead, he describes Thompson's philosophy on immunity:  \"one conviction is better than none.\"</span></p> <p><span>Hartley's descriptions of the controversies surrounding Thompson's gubernatorial campaign and tenure as governor (he is in the middle of his second term) are equally one-sided and inadequate.  He merely mentions that Thompson accepted donations and gifts from prominent Illinois businessmen and corporations.</span></p> <p><span>The contributions to the 1976 campaign--his first--included a total of $299,834 from business interests:  $46,580 of that from Ray Kroc, chairman of the board of McDonald's Corporation; $48,981 from medical groups, and $47,250 from construction contractors.  Hartley covers the issues of possible political influence resulting from these contributions by quoting Thompson:  \"I've not made a single promise.  Besides, what could I do for Ray Kroc?\"</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>N ADDITION to paying scant attention to criticism of Thampson, Hartley includes in the early part of the book cloying descriptions of Thompson's childhood like the following:</span></p> <p><span>The father and son enjoyed a number of activities together, such as fishing and attendance at athletic contests.  Both followed the Cubs and the Bears closely.  The father encouraged his son's interest in animals--especially dogs--and helped him with photography by building him a darkroom.  Reminiscing about her husband and oldest son, Agnes Thompson listed their similarities:  \"outgoing, friendly, kind and generous.\"</span></p> <p><span>Sweet, banal stuff but why write pages of it?</span></p> <p><span>A more significant problem is the apparent lack of any prupose for writing this book.  In his preface, Hartley writes that the names that come to mind as practitioners of today's \"modern politics\" are Jimmy Carter, Jerry Brown, and Jim Thompson.  At no point in the text, though, does Hartley pursue the similarities among the three men or the concept of \"modern politics.\"</span></p> <p><span>Hartley also believes that Thompson is worth writing about because he might run for the Presidency some day.  However, the only other person in the book who thinks so is Thompson himself, who inscribed a friend's 1953 high school yearbook:  \"Jim Thompson, Pres. of U.S. 1984-1992.\"</span></p> <p><span>It makes you think that Hartley's sublime reason for writing such a book was to assure his own entree into the envisioned Big Jim Administration.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>S IT STANDS, the major problem with <i>Big Jim Thompson of Illinois</i> is that most people couldn't care less about Big Jim Thompson.  Fact is, unless you're from Illinois in general or the late Richard J. Daley's former kingdom of Cook County in particular, Gov. James R. Thompson of Illinois is probably as important to you as Gov. Ed Herschler of Wyoming (unless, of course, you happen to be from Wyoming--which, if you're an easterner, is somewhere near Alaska.).</span></p>"}

His decision in the next budget message to request funding to supplement the staffs of those agencies charged with enforcing the 1973 legislation is only a small step along the road of environmental sanity; the basic obstacles in the way of those who would prevent the extinction of hundreds of species remains.</span></p> <p><span>In two moves, in 1978 and last year, Congress destroyed much of the power of the Endangered Species Act.  In 1978, Congress passed and Carter signed a bill that created a committee of Cabinet and Congressional officials that could overrule the Endangered Species Act--and its provisions for the protection of all endangered species--in favor of any construction project that warranted such an exception.  In other words, <i>any</i> species could be exchanged for any project.</span></p> <p><span>This legislation was enacted after the Supreme Court upheld the Interior Department's ban on completing the Tennessee Valley Authority's Tellico Dam because it threatened the snail darter with extinction.

Before we go too far, we should consider a few points:</span></p> <p><span>1) Contrary to Administration pronouncements, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan is not an attack on the U.S.  It is an attack on Afghanistan.  It is also a warning to the non-aligned nations, a good example of Soviet intentions and attitudes towards national self-determination.  Before we go rushing off to confront them, we should consider the effect of our actions on the Third World nations we are supposedly interested in anyway.</span></p> <p><span>2) SALT II is essential to U.S. security.  President Carter just a few months ago told treaty opponents he wanted SALT II passed because it was in the U.S. national interest, not a gift to the Soviets.  Brezhnev too has been running into attacks from hardliners who don't want arms control.  Those who say SALT II will enshrine Soviet superiority fail to say how we will be better off if the treaty is shelved.  The arms race will escalate, and the Soviet lead will in all probability widen further.  SALT II reigns in the Soviets, and since the U.S. has not been building up its forces for years as the Soviets have, the ceiling we set will force them to make greater sacrifices than it will us.  The fact that the Soviets have stretched SALT I provisions as far as possible shows, perversely, that they are unlikely to cheat outright.</span></p> <p><span>3) Detente has not failed:  we never really tried it.  The Jackson-Vanik amendment (to compel Soviets to let more Jews emigrate) prevented them from gaining favored-nation status in trade, and SALT II was already dead, at least in their eyes, way before Afghanistan.  Since they were not getting any benefits from restraint, why should they restrain themselves?</span></p> <p><span>4) The U.S. is not blameless.  How can we uphold the holy principle of non-interference after Vietnam, the Bay of Pigs, the Dominican Republic, Iran, Chile?  CIA-sponsored coups may be more subtle, but they have the same effect as actual invasions.</span></p> <p><span>5) Defense increases and getting in bed with military juntas will not increase U.S. security, let alone improve the international situation.  They make right-wing critics happy, but they do not help.  The Soviets are threatening the Persian Gulf, we are told, and since the Western oil junkies are dependent on a lifeline of tankers pouring through the Gulf, this is intolerable.  The question is:  would $20 billion make use more secure if put into more bombs or into intensive research and development of alternatives to oil, like widespread conservation, cogenaration and renewable energy sources?  Will propping up the General Zias of the world make us more secure, or improve relations with the Third World?  The reason it is so easy for the Soviets to stir up trouble, and to win allies, is because the U.S. defines itself as the keeper of the world order however it happens to exist right now.  When the inevitable popular revolutions come, they turn anti-American.  Remember Iran?  Why must we be saddled with all the losers?  As to arming China, or at least providing her with peaceful technology, which--surprise, surprise--she later converts to military uses, it was only a little while ago that the yellow peril was more feared than the Red menace.  Who knows if the alliances won't shift once more, and a militarily built-up China will prove more threatening than the Soviets no appear?</span></p> <p><span>6) Showing our toughness is not an alternative.  The worst possible outcome would be for the president, prodded by the Reaganites and the Russian and Iranian challenges to his manhood, to invade, blockade or bomb Iran.  The hostages would die, anti-American sentiments all over the Mideast and South Asia would explode into violence, perhaps toppling a few shaky regimes and turning Third World condemnation of the Russians (for Afghanistan) and Iran (for hostage-taking) into condemnation of America.  And a coordinated Western trade embargo towards Iran and Russia is not really possible.  Europe and Japan need the oil, the market for technology.  How will economic suicide teach the world we mean business?</span></p> <p><span>The world is different now than when we entered the first Cold War.  Five nations have nuclear arsenals, a couple more have the bomb but no way to use it, and a dozen others might get in it a few years.  The maintenance of international peace and stability is essential for global survival.  We no longer perceive an international Communist conspiracy (we align with the Chinese and are not yet conducting domestic witchhunts) but Sovietophobia is giving domestic reactionaries and demagogues a field day.  We can no longer manipulate the Third World as we once did, and so we have to consider their viewpoint, their interests, in our calculations.  Perhaps Marxism offers a better alternative path of development than capitalism.  Perhaps the multination corporations are more of a threat to them than the Soviets.  Perhaps a multi-billion dollar assistance package, and on their terms, not ours, might best advance U.S. support among the Third World, not to mention contribute more to their welfare, than pumping yet more arms around the globe.  Maybe even that will not be credible as long as we continue to support the South Africans and keep blacks and Hispanics in a state of second-class citizenship at home.  If the oil-rich shieks and the Chinese are so afraid of Russia, let them arm and train the Afghan rebels.  Let them get friendly with the Baluchis before the Soviets do.</span></p> <p><span>Obviously, we have good reason to doubt Russia's intentions.  But we often paint them as stronger, more internally secure and more expansionist than they really are, while downplaying our own international transgressions and playing up our weaknesses (worst case analysis).  Still, before we totally swallow the line of right-wingers, we should consider if building up the military, escalating the arms race, allying with petty dictators, and putting off criticial social programs at home and developmental assistance overseas will make use more secure.  It did not work last time, and it has brought us to where we are now.  Are we really getting over our post-Vietnam neuroses, or are we being suckered once more?  It looks like we're going to need another Sixties in the Eighties.</span></p> <p><span><i>Eve Cummings is a graduate student in philosophy at Boston University.</i></span></p>"}
{"title": "Reconsider the Shah | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Neither as a student of politics nor a follower of any particular ideology am I qualified to discuss Reverend Kimball's remarks on Iran's present situation (see The Crimson, Jan. 9).  But as an Iranian Moslem student currently at the same institution and a member of the Center for the Study of World Religion as is Rev. Kimball, I would like to raise a few questions about his article.</span></p> <p><span>First, on what does he base the \"facts\" he has uncovered?  Had he personally experienced life in Iran during the past regime so as to judge the truth of statements made about that time?  Does he have adequate familiartity with Iran's history and traditions?  If so he could have reassured his parents of Iran's 3000 years of civilization, hospitality and respect for humanity.  Iranians have always rejected brutality except in a few exceptional circumstances.  He did not have to look upon his trip into Iran's as a venture into a jungle of savage beasts.</span></p> <p><span>Reverend Kimball talks of his impression of the intensity of the Iranian people's hatred for the deposed Shah.  Did he meet any of the thousands and thousands of intellectuals and ordinary Iranians who are confined to their homes and dare not open their mouths, and who are praying for the right time to come?  Did he have the opportunity to meet and know the traditional bazaris (the businessmen in the town marketplaces)?  How does he evaluate the intensity of this hatred then?  Was his visit an organized tour where he saw only what the authorities wanted him to see?</span></p> <p><span>Had he ever been in Iran during the past regime, particularly in its later years, he would have seen how even in the remotest villages, the single tiny shop carried all the basic medicines--at unbelievably low prices, the government paid two-thirds of the price.  He would have seen the government hospitals and clinics found in every small town.  He would have seen that in late 1978 the price of bread, tea, sugar, and other basic necessities was the same as 15 years before, because the government picked up three-fourths of the tab.</span></p> <p><span>Is he aware that 99 per cent of the 60,000 Iranian students in the U.S. are the children of plumbers, mechanics, taxi drivers, masons, gardeners?  They are not here on scholarship but on their fathers' income.  If it is true that the Shah had squeezed the wealth out of the Iranian people for the last 37 years, how could these lower class people be so prosperous as to afford to send their children to study abroad, even visiting them every now and then and returning home with products from U.S. department stores?  Does Rev. Kimball know that every Iranian student, no matter what academic stage, received $200 per month from the Shah's government and health insurance up to $50,000?</span></p> <p><span>Reverend Kimball mentions the \"oppression and brutality (that) existed under the Shah.\"  Did he ever meet the general (leaving out names) who had gone so far as to organize a coup d'etat against the Shah, and, after being caught, was only exiled to France for a year?  After this time he returned to Teheran and never stopped his bitter criticism of the Shah, holding meetings every week at his home or the home of his co-ideologist.  Strangely enough, he had to leave for Paris after the Revolution.  Did Rev. Kimball meet the most revered and loved Iranian lawyer who was staying in the U.S. for the past 15 years directing the anti-Shah movement, who went to Iran immediately after the Revolution but had to leave for Paris soon after that.  Does Rev. Kimball remember that even the Ayatollah Khomeini, number one enemy of the Shah, was only exiled in the holy city of Najaf.</span></p> <p><span>I do not disagree that many of the SAVAK agents have been justly punished by Khomeini or that some members of the past regime were corrupt.  But for Rev. Kimball to say \"almost everyone had a brother or father who had been taken away or could pull up his pants leg and show burn marks and say \"Look what SAVAK did to me',\" is a very one-sided, general and unsupported remark for a man who was only in Iran 11 days.  There are 35 million Iranians.  How many did he meet?  What Rev. Kimball saw was only what he was scheduled to see.</span></p> <p><span>He also says, \"SAVAK would sometimes dismember children of suspected political dissenters to gain confessions.  They held some of the children aloft and proudly exhibited their own scars and stumps.\"  This is an outrageous statement.  Did he ever witness this extraordinary process?  Even though he may have been exposed to certain scars and stumps on certain children, these could be the results of other unrelated incidents.</span></p> <p><span>What Rev. Kimball did not discover on his trip was:</span></p> <p><span>--Not only does President Carter not deserve to be criticized for his remark to the Shah that \"Iran is a stable island in the middle of a sea of turmoil,\" but he has been proven right.  It is hardly a year since the Shah's departure and the whole area has gone upside down.</span></p> <p><span>--Islam has been chosen merely as the best garb for mean political revenge.</span></p> <p><span>--It is good to move with the times but it is much better to preserve integrity.</span></p> <p><span><i>Nezhat Safa is a visiting scholar at the Center for the Study of World Religion</i></span></p>"}

{"title": "A Fool's Game | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>P</b>RESIDENT CARTER'S State of the Union address calling for a United States military buildup, draft registration and a Persian Gulf Doctrine tragically confuses machismo with determination.  Carter is trying to cloak the emptiness and ineptness of his three-year-old foreign policy by relying on the political bromides that have swept generations of politicians into office.  His political grandstanding obscures the fact that our present crisis is in many ways the product of our inability to enact a coherent energy policy.</span></p> <p><span>The inadequacy of the United States' energy policy and of Carter's contradictory and often hypocritical foreign policy have locked him into a course of action which is as dangerous as it is predictable.  The inconsistencies of the newly promulgated \"Carter Doctrine\" stem from Carter's misunderstanding of detente.</span></p> <p><span>Carter has consistently confused the reality of detente with its rhetoric.  He has failed to understand that for the Soviets detente implied cooperation but not acquiescence to the West.  He sent conflicting signals to both our allies and to the Soviet Union by following a consistently hypocritical policy on arms.</span></p> <p><span>In order to protect SALT II, and to present a picture of himself as a strong leader, Carter authorized the development and deployment of the cruise and M-X missiles in such a way as to render the SALT treaty meaningless to the Soviets.  Simultaneously, Carter has tried to emphasize his commitment to non-military means of securing U.S. interests.</span></p> <p><span>But Carter's most telling historical failure--his inability to conceive or push through a viable energy policy--has in large part forced his militaristic response.  The Persian Gulf is vital to the stability and economic survival of the United States and its allies because of continued dependence on foreign oil.  Carter has substituted flag-waving for the economic sacrifices that energy conservation demands.</span></p> <p><span>The Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan is a deplorable act of aggression; the United States does have a responsibility to force the Soviet Union to see that such actions have grave international consequences.  But Carter's militaristic response is not the right answer.  The president is relying on the same assumptions that have doomed our foreign policy in the past--the belief in a bipolar world, in matching militarism with militarism.  He is playing brinkmanship with the Soviets, threatening them with war to check their warlike advance.</span></p> <p><span>Carter's decisions to impose economic sanctions and to express displeasure through diplomatic channels are effective nonmilitary ways to check Soviet actions.  An inflated military budget, draft registration, and rapid deployment forces give America the illusion of preparedness and allow the U.S. to be more easily led into war, while in reality not adding anything to America's capacity to defend herself.</span></p> <p><span>Instead of hastening a direct confrontation, Carter should have used this genuine national crisis to attack the roots of the problem.  He should have proposed a major energy policy instead of making a throwaway push for synthetic fuels in the last minutes of his speech.</span></p> <p><span>Carter's militarism perpetuates international conflict as a game of superpower chicken, opposing Soviet aggression with U.S. resistance in a steady escalation towards open warfare.  Carter's underlying assumption is that the U.S. goal is to confront the Soviet Union directly; in fact that goal should be to block Soviet expansionism.  Carter should not resort to self-serving bravado that is as empty as it is dangerous.  Instead Carter should seek to place the U.S. at the head of the broad-based international movement now condemning the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan by supplying arms in areas directly threatened by Soviet aggression and most importantly by espousing national sovereignty as the basic principle of U.S. policy.</span></p>"}

{"title": "No Registration | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>B</b>Y ASKING Congress for a reintroduction of Selective Service registration--the first step towards a new military draft--President Carter has made a hasty and dangerous decision, one that will affect all Americans, not just those eligible to be drafted.  Carter is placing a politically opportunistic \"get tough with the Russians\" attitude before sound statesmanship by raising the ante in his battle with the Soviet Union with the lives of the 33 million men and women in the 18 to 26-year-old age group.</span></p> <p><span>The United States currently has a two-million-man armed force, which is adequate to meet any immediate threat, anywhere in the world.  Carter's proposal will not enhance our military position against the Soviet's but it will needlessly and unproductively increase tensions with them.  If Congress decides to revive the draft, we will have a bloated army, one that this nation's historically aching-for-action military establishment might be dangerously tempted to deploy.</span></p> <p><span>Carter wants registration to bolster the image of a new American swagger, an attitude designed to create the illusion that this nation must respond militarily to every Soviet action.  We do need to answer their expansion, but a draft is an inappropriate reaction.  The draft is a response for the sake of making a response, not because it is intelligent.  Continuation of such policies could mean that we may at some time feel trapped into making a direct military response--even if it, like the draft, is unwarranted.</span></p> <p><span><b>Y</b>ET IF REGISTRATION and, ultimately, the draft, return, as now seems likely, the Selective Service System should grant no exemptions, except conscientious objectors and those physically unable to take part.  Men and women, rich and poor, undergraduate and graduate students should be required to serve.  Too often in the history of this nation--the Vietnam War being the most appalling example--the children of the people who run the country and make the decision whether to go to war have been allowed to let others do the fighting for them.  A new draft is not an attractive alternative, but an equitable draft is far superior to fraudulent lotteries of privilege.

Reagan's age should be as critical a factor in his candidacy as his suggestions about American foreign policy.</span></p> <p><span>Republican candidates most likely believe that questioning Reagan's age can only damage their own campaigns; the voters would label them discriminatory and narrow-minded.  More importantly, the candidates fear losing the support of the elderly, whose votes carry great weight in critical states like New York and Florida.  But this fear may be misplaced.</span></p> <p><span>If anyone understands the difficulties of becoming old, it is the elderly.  They have watched President Carter, a man 15 years Reagan's junior, age visibly during his term as president, and they will be the first to doubt that a 70-year-old Ronald Reagan could handle the stresses of the office.</span></p> <p><span>There are, of course, many statesmen who have served in political office into old age.  Sen. Jacob K. Javits (R-N.Y.) and Sam Ervin from North Carolina have performed effectively and inspiringly for years.  But neither was president.  There are 100 senators, and if one should become incapacitated in office, Congressional affairs would not slow down noticeably.  But there is only one president.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>N THE 1980s, presidential advisers will make a majority of high-level decisions because of the sheer bulk and variety of demands facing the chief executive.  An incapacitated president would burden top officials with a larger number of policy decisions, and there is a real chance that this might happen during a Reagan administration.  Electing Reagan means electing a collection of administrators.</span></p> <p><span>With the questions of leadership ability so prevalent in this campaign, it is surprising that so few politicians or journalists have discussed the potential problems of having a 70-year-old president.  Reagan's opponents should questions repeatedly his ability to govern at age 70 until they receive a satisfactory response.  Silence about his age is more than merely a political oversight; it is irresponsible.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Not Just the Man Next Door | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b>F YOU BUY what Edwin Diamond and Bruce Mazlish are selling in this political year bio of Jimmy Carter, the president proved on Tuesday that he is both a part of, and apart from, the people of New Hampshire.  Carter is running for reelection, the authors would tell us, because of his deep psychological need to \"measure up and win.\"  The man from Georgia picked up his 49 per cent by carefully managing to control his emotions and quell the steamy contradictions which threaten at any moment to split his newly-parted scalp.  Carter got to the White House through his belief in God and, a la Norman Vincent Peale, by the power of positive thinking.</span></p> <p><span>This is a terrifying book, one that everybody who plans to vote for Jimmy Carter should be force-fed before he pulls the lever.  The authors' conclusions strain the obvious (\"The reality is that both parents 'shape' Jimmy Carter, just as most of us are influenced by both mother and father\"), but what lies between the lines is genuinely scary.  \"We believe that Carter really believes in his own promises, and his desire to bring compassion and justice to the victims of the sinful world,\" Mazlish and Diamond conclude; it's just that the angels watching over the Oval Office can't get it all together.</span></p> <p><span><b>E</b>RRANT IN their path, blinded by the realization that Jimmy Carter is God's personal representative on earth, the authors indulge in baths of high-school psychology.  From his childhood in Georgia, little Jimmy carries the entire burden of Southern history to Annapolis, where he grits his teeth for three years.  Laboring under the shadow of his father, Carter develops the win-or-die attitude of the killer politician.  Crushed by his failure to win the governor's seat the first time around, Carter goes off to find himself, \"a star pupil in the self-improvement school.\"</span></p> <p><span>Carter trusts the people because, finally, he trusts himself.  He and the people merge into one.  This revelation came to him during the process of the born-again experience, when he went door to door.  Since he healed divisions in his own psyche, he feels able to be a healer/leader to his countrymen.</span></p> <p><span>Who is Jimmy Carter?  \"He is a complex, contradictory personality,\" Mazlish and Diamond say.  They continue in a flash of insight:  \"Most of us, of course, are complex and full of contradictions.\"  Carter's brand of neo-populist rhetoric and waffling reflects those contradictions.  Expediency exists as part of Carter's \"realism.\"  The president blurs the lines between liberalism and conservatism because he must be \"true to his own character, with its basic need to embrace contradictions.\"  Carter's remembrances of his downtrodden childhood, his career as a \"nuclear engineer,\" his faith in Bert Lance--all explained.</span></p> <p><span>He seems compelled to project his inner feelings--his emotional reality--outward as a description of events and external reality.  He does not 'lie'; but he shapes the world according to a 'deeper' truth, his own needs.</span></p> <p><span>Or later:  \"He chooses to suppress--the sin of omission.  He does not lie to us.\"  The authors dismiss the other interpretation--that Carter is just another hack politician in the Bilboesque tradition--in a series of short clauses and brief references.</span></p> <p><span>At times, Mazlish and Diamond descend from the simplistic into the banal.  In various parts of the book, the authors compare Carter to DeGaulle, Gandhi, the young Luther (a la Erik Erikson) Oliver Cromwell and Handsome Lake, a Seneca Indian who had a series of revelations that led to his belief in his own leadership.  Where other presidents are heroes or policy-makers, Carter belongs in the ranks of \"revitalizers.\"  Bear with the authors' dangling prose:</span></p> <p><span>The revitalization leader brings both political and religious sustenance to those in need; he converts his own profound religious experience to political purposes.  In his mission of bringing spiritual rebirth, such a leader necessarily deals in symbols; he often derives his own power from the ability to communicate with supernatural agents.  He talks directly with God often through prayer.  An 'outsider,' he stands apart from the existing authority structure, and against the Establishment, deriving his powers from his experience with the supernatural.</span></p> <p><span><b>B</b>UBBLING INSIDE those Baptist-cold blue eyes, however, is a heritage of whippings, humiliation, defeat, depression and finally--drumroll--rebirth.  Since Mazlish and Diamond finished their book, however, Carter has strayed from the authors' picture of him as a model of control.  \"Carter's incredible competitive streak nowhere appears in any of the accounts of his White House days,\" the authors write.  This about the man who said he would whip his opponent's ass.  And \"crisis thinking,\" the authors tell us, \"runs counter to Carter's instincts.\"  A terrific politician, perhaps--but a dismal leader.</span></p> <p><span>Try as they do to protect Carter's image, the authors inevitably slip into the bottom line on the president.  They label the chapter on his childhood \"Just an ordinary little boy,\" and scattered throughout the remainder of the book are reminders of Carter's aggressive normalcy.  \"Carter fits in the American grain of thousands of upwardly mobile men and women in business and sales.\"  Or, as Diamond concludes, \"Jimmy Carter is like thousands of other middle-aged men of middling stature in authority in our society.  He is the man next door--if you live in the nicest neighborhood in a nice small town or a 'good' suburb.\"  Only iron gates and political smarts separate Carter from 100,000 other people.  And with the president ahead in the polls, this is nothing but depressing news.</span></p>"}
{"title": "The Art of Healing Paraguay | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><i>Dr. Joel Filartiga is a medical philanthropist and artist whose portraits of peasant life have recently circulated internationally.  Filartiga runs a free medical service, the only one for miles, in the southeastern region of Paraguay.  His condemnations of General Alfredo Stroessner's dictatorship in Paraguay have won him the government's enmity and led to the political murder of his son in 1976.  Taking on his nation's reform as a solo mission, he came to the United States last month to rally support in American colleges and to lobby in Washington, D.C.</i></span></p> <p><span><i>The people of Paraguay have captured me,\" he explained in an interview following his address to a Harvard and Cambridge crowd which packed Phillips Brooks House to listen in shocked silence to his story, or rather to the story of Paraguay's ordeal since General Alfredo Stroessner took over in a coup d'etat in 1954.  Despite Stroessner's stranglehold on the country, Filartiga believes he is \"a slave of my people,\" not of the government.</i></span></p> <p><span>In non-descript double-knit vest and mute-grey suit, his shirt bulging conspicuously at the waistline, Filartiga looks more like the semi-retired family g.p., benevolent but dilapidated.  Nearsighted bug eyes peered out of thick spectacles.  His roly-poly, bumbling figure gives him the image of a jolly plump man, not one laden by the responsibilities of nursing 37,000 mestizos who depend on him alone for health care.</span></p> <p><span>Filartiga has run a free medical clinic in the Ybycui Valley in southeastern Paraguay for the last 18 years.  He runs the clinic single-handedly, performing all operations alone, with the assistance of his wife, one assistant--last year, Elisa Kleinman, a Harvard medical student --and two peasant aides he has trained as paramedics.  Open from 8 a.m. until late evening, the clinic provides the only medical assistance to the isolated countryside.</span></p> <p><span>After Filartiga leaves the clinic, sometimes as late as 2 or 3 a.m., he goes home to draw in stark angularities and symbolic distractions, the suffering of the people he serves.  The blatantly political message in his drawings of peasant life--which have circulated widely, in California and Mexico two years ago--and his outspoken criticism of Stroessner's human rights violations have forced him into direct confrontation with Stroessner's secret police.  He has been arrested and interrogated several times, his family called in for questioning.  In 1976, Filartiga paid a devastating price for his political views:  His 17-year-old son Joelito died after torture in a local police station.</span></p> <p><span>As an artist, Filartiga wishes to expose his nation's pain, force outsiders to examine Paraguayan wounds and ultimately to heal them.  As a doctor, Filartiga's artistic vision finds literal expression.  But in his son's case, his physician status could not save the battered body that he found four hours after the child was kidnapped by the police.</span></p> <p><span>Although Filartiga is certainly not the first victim of the repressive regime, few families in Paraguay will discuss their experience, much less launch a protest because they fear reprisal.  When torture ends in death--as is often the case in countries such as Paraguay where political violence in standard state policy--most families bury their dead quietly and lay low, hoping to be forgotten.  According to Amnesty International reports, the main human rights violations committed under Stroessner's rule are indefinite detention without trial, torture, often resulting in death, and \"disappearance\" following arrest.  (In Filartiga's case, the government has made extensive use of all three techniques.)</span></p> <p><span>But unlike most victims, Filartiga refused to remain silent.  Filartiga's abhorrence of violent methods of political control climaxed in the death of his son.  Just before midnight on March 29, 1976, Joelito disappeared from his house in Asuncion, Paraguay.  Two uniformed officers awoke his sister four hours later and brought her to the neighbor's home, where she discovered her brother, a beaten, slashed and electroshocked corpse.  A police inspector told her it was a crime of passion; her brother had been found in bed by the neighbor's husband with his wife.</span></p> <p><span>The husband was quickly ushered into the nearest police station where he \"confessed\" to the murder and has been imprisoned ever since.  The wife \"disappeared.\"  Overwhelming evidence points to a government kidnapping.  An autopsy by three doctors showed Joelito died from multiple cuts and burns often caused by beating and electroshock treatment.  The police testimonies, in addition, contradict.</span></p> <p><span>Stroessner's regime has its reasons for singling out Filartiga as a politically dangerous figure.  As the sole physician to almost 40,000 peasants in the poorest country of the continent, Filartiga had attained the unofficial status of folk hero and rural leader.  If anyone can mobilize revolt, he is in the most strategic position to do so.  Though Filartiga does not aspire to organize politically subversive activity, his art publicizes the repercussions of Stroessner's reign on an international scale which seriously threatens the dictatorship's security.</span></p> <p><span>Stroessner and the Filantigas weren't always on opposite sides of the fence.  According to Chris Hager '66, who assisted Filartiga at the clinic last year, Filartiga's father was an influential industrialist, tobacco exporter, and personal friend of Stroessner's.</span></p> <p><span>Sickened by his father's social circle and economic exploitations, Filartiga began to work with his father's laborers \"out of curiosity.\"  He recalls with satisfaction earning his first check for a solid week's labor.  He soon after announced to his father that he intended to work full-time.  Many long family battles followed.  He eventually left and continued to work alongside laborers, leaving only to get a medical degree.  In these early work years, \"I learned compassion,\" he says.</span></p> <p><span>Filartiga found his voice--a strident one--as well as his compassion in these years.  His son's death taught him to use it.  Joelito's one-and-a-half-hour torture session was recorded by the police, because they were so certain it would produce a confession.  Filartiga has heard the tape, heard his son cry out that he had nothing to confess, listened while they accelerated the electric shocks, administered through his fingertips and genitals, until Joelito suddenly had a cardiac arrest and died.</span></p> <p><span>Filartiga did not retreat to nurse his pain in private.  Instead he laid his son's naked body, mauled and burnt, in state on the bloody mattress just as he found him.  He encouraged hundreds to file by and see the evidence for themselves.  Filartiga next distributed photographs of his son and the details of his death to the Paraguayan papers.  Several newspapers printed the pictures and ran the full story.  Finally, Filartiga filed a homicide suit against the police inspector and three other members of the force.</span></p> <p><span>Despite his publicity campaign, the case was still unsettled when Filartiga arrived at Harvard three years later.  The government has revoked the license of the lawyer representing Filartiga, then imprisoned him.  Without a lawyer, Filartiga will undoubtedly lose the trial, and, according to Paraguayan law, the loser must pay the damages and the other's legal fees.  Such payment will cost him the clinic.</span></p> <p><span>In place of his son, Filartiga appears to have adopted a nation.  He speaks of \"my people,\" not as a politician would carelessly sling around the tired buzzword, but as a father who has expanded his household to embrace a country.</span></p> <p><span>The Filartiga clinic is in fact home to the 30 to 40 people who line up on the patio daily.  Filartiga's patients, some of whom travel several days to reach his clinic, suffer from malnutrition, anemia and diseases caused by inadequate hygiene.  Lately many of his patients have arrived with kidney infections, rashes and appendicitis, which he believes are caused by the phosphate insecticide the government bought from the United States, a type banned in the United States.  \"Anything they throw away in other countries,\" Filartiga says, \"is sold over here.\"  Filartiga often returns to this metaphor of his nation as dumping grounds for the world, observing that Nazi criminals flocked to Paraguay for refuge following World War II.  Somoza likewise retreated to Paraguay temporarily last summer.  \"My country is the trash heap of the world,\" Filartiga states calmly, but his thick lenses magnify the pain in his eyes.</span></p> <p><span>The phosphate poisoning case is only one instance in which Filartiga holds the United States accountable for his nation's woes.  Filartiga outlines the relationship between Paraguay and the United States in blunt, unsparing words:  \"The government of Paraguay was created in the United States State Department in the year 1959.\"  Carter's human rights stance does not move Filartiga; he calls it a \"make-up policy,\" which makes \"the regime swallowable\" and allows repression to continue.</span></p> <p><span>But a deep faith in the \"strength of people to free themselves\" from oppression once they are educated has led him to travel to the United States whenever he can slip out of Paraguay--usually without a visa--and come speak to students.  At Harvard, he told a hushed audience, \"By liberating the people of Latin America, Americans will become free themselves.\"</span></p> <p><span>Filartiga refuses to be affiliated with any party.  Neither does he support a violent revolution.  Human decency alone, he contends, dissolves dictatorships.  More threatening to Stroessner than violent rebellion is caring.  \"I am serving the part of the country hated most--the people.\"  Filartiga draws on dignity and faith to combat that hatred.  Dignity Filartiga fosters every day as he promotes health among the peasants.  Faith in the human capacity to overcome a dark political world allows him to continue his practice and sketch 100 drawings a year--in the shadow of his son's memory.</span></p>"}

Keene, George Bush's political director, admits that polls in New Hampshire include \"eight to ten points of Iowa hype for our candidate that will disappear,\" he nevertheless believes there has been a significant shift in grass roots support from Ronald Reagan to Bush in the race for the Republican nomination.</span></p> <p><span>Tim Kraft, head of the Carter/Mondale Presidential Committee, sees no such shift in the Democratic Party, and says that Iowa only demonstrated the resurfacing support Carter has had all along.  Kraft adds, \"We didn't believe the polls last summer [when as few as 19 per cent of those questioned said they approved of Carter's performance] and we don't believe them now.\"</span></p> <p><span>Since their candidates grabbed victories in Iowa and the top spots in the opinion polls, Keene and Kraft have wallowed in the praise of journalists and fellow political strategists.</span></p> <p><span>With the New Hampshire and Massachusetts primaries looming in the near future, the two campaign chiefs, who were interviewed at the Kennedy School of Government this past weekend, must now evaluate upcoming tests from a new perspective--that of the front runner.</span></p> <p><span>Neither man thinks that the competition is very far behind.  Keene speaks from an intimate knowledge of a Reagan campaign built on a \"strong and resilient base.\"  He led Reagan's 1976 primary effort in the South and worked for the former California governor through the end of 1978.</span></p> <p><span>\"Reagan is still the most popular candidate within the party,\" Keene says, adding with reference to Iowa, \"He's the only candidate who can stand a defeat.\"</span></p> <p><span>Keene marvels that \"Reagan sent in his 'B' team to organize the state.  They did a lousy job.  He downplayed and insulted the state and still almost won.\"</span></p> <p><span>Despite this admiration for Reagan, Keene believes that Bush can win over the die-hard Republican conservatives to complement his popularity among moderates.  Keene points to \"second-level support\" among the backers of Reagan, Sen. Howard H. Baker Jr. (R-Tenn.) and John B. Connally.  \"Everybody basically likes George Bush,\" he adds.</span></p> <p><span>Kraft has mixed praise for the Kennedy organization.  \"They put together a good campaign in Iowa considering their late start,\" but in Kennedy headquarters, \"there are a lot of chiefs and few Indians.\"</span></p> <p><span>Unlike Keene, Kraft does not emphasize recent converts, but speaks instead of a subtle \"soft support.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"People were thinking that any and all problems must be attributed to the president last summer.  That is no longer so,\" Kraft says, adding that voters who may have voiced temporary frustrations over the past year never lost faith in Carter.</span></p> <p><span>While Kraft foresees no major changes in his campaign strategy, Keene predicts that Bush will deal more specifically with the issues \"as the public begins to think of him as a potential president\" and the media shift their analysis from \"his campaign to who he is.\"</span></p> <p><span>Keene explains that the media have contributed a great deal to Bush's success.  He adds that the networks and the major newspapers \"construct a continuing series about somebody that develops.  They [the voters] want somebody who's got some confidence, good grace and humor.\"</span></p> <p><span>Bush's adviser says voters are \"not obsessed with the issues.  It's not healthy to have such a politicized society.\"</span></p> <p><span>Kraft, however, refuses to discuss the media's influence with any seriousness.  \"The press is very democratic,\" he says, adding with a big grin, \"It treats everybody like dogs.\"</span></p> <p><span>Kraft responds with guarded optimism to questions about the New Hampshire face-off on February 26.  He says Kennedy's highly publicized address at Georgetown University \"energized [Kennedy's] troops, but will not win over independents or Carter Democrats.\"</span></p> <p><span>Acknowledging that the Carter camp is hoping for more than mere survival in Kennedy's neck of the woods, Kraft says, \"If Kennedy loses in Maine and New Hampshire, his claim of elective superiority will be gone.\"</span></p> <p><span>Keene says that his man will struggle in New Hampshire because \"Baker can drain votes away from Bush,\" and adds that Reagan operatives have already suggested a Reagan-Baker debate to isolate Bush.  \"They'll hear from us if that comes off,\" Keene warns.</span></p> <p><span>Like Kraft, however, Keene cannot disguise the confidence he has in his own political handiwork:  \"People want character, not just the issues.  It's an entire judgement of a man... of George Bush.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Harvard Looks to Upset B.C...  While Tradition Favors B.U. | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The first two Monday nights in February.  Four rival schools--Harvard, Boston University, Boston College, Northeastern--four anxious hockey teams, four tense hockey games:  one winner, three losers.  A hockey cathedral, Boston Garden, which first opened its doors to the sport when Calvin Coolidge was in the White House, rattled by the din of 15,000 fanatics and an occasional passing Green Line hulk outside.  Blizzard optional.  The Beanpot.</span></p> <p><span>Ask someone who grew up in the area what it means to play in the Beanpot.  He'll grope for words, maybe mumble something about \"pride\" or \"electricity in the air.\"  Then, a pause.  As a kid, he played street hockey every day in sub-freezing weather, using the curbs for boards and garbage cans or a Rube Goldberg wooden contraption for a net; made his parents wake up at four in the morning to shuttle him to some dingy arena when ice time is cheaper and the Pee Wee team can practice; stared transfixed as Bobby Orr led the Bruins to glory.</span></p> <p><span>And every February..two trips to the Garden.  \"It's the <i>Beanpot,\"</i> he says finally.  \"You know.  What can you say?\"</span></p> <p><span>Dave Burke of Harvard grew up that way.  \"I dreamed about playing in the Beanpot all my life,\" he said this week, recalling that he had attended the tournament every year with his family \"as far back as I can remember.\"  Recruited heavily by local colleges and lured with free Beanpot tickets (\"the seats got better and better\"), Burke nonetheless decided to go to Notre Dame, which he \"really dug.\"  In fact, he had already completed the initial acceptance.</span></p> <p><span>But then Harvard coach Billy Cleary started dangling the prospect of playing in the Beanpot instead of just watching it.  Did Burke really want to spend four years in South Bend, Indiana, where the word \"Beanpot\" draws a blank stare instead of glazed eyes?  He did not.  \"I'd sacrifice almost anything just to win a Beanpot,\" the sophomore center says now.</span></p> <p><span>Burke is not alone.  The 28th Beanpot Tournament gets underway tonight with Northeastern shooting for the moon (B.U.) at 6 p.m., followed by this season's number one college hockey phenomenon, B.C., against a youthful but determined Harvard squad in the showcase contest at nine.  The performances of the four traditional rivals so far this season run the gamut from the East's best (B.C.) to worst (Northeastern), but you can throw those out now.  Grabbing the beans doesn't involve standings or records.</span></p> <p><span>For one thing, unlike last year, the games won't count in ECAC Division One competition.  But more than that, the Beanpot is (to borrow an oft-used phrase) \"a season in itself.\"  Two quick wins at the Garden transcend any number of embarassing disasters in Ithaca, Potsdam or Hanover.  Conversely, failing to uphold a reputation as number one in the Beanpot puts a damper on even the most successful of years.</span></p> <p><span>When all is said and done in college hockey in these parts, it's the Beanpot parts, it's the Beanpot that sticks in the memory of player and fan alike.  Each team faces essentially the same challenge:  rise to the occasion or fall short.</span></p> <p><span>A year ago, Harvard and Boston College went into the tourney hoping to gain some respect in the midst of disappointing seasons.  Harvard accomplished this by giving B.U. a scare opening night, leading 2-1 after two periods before dropping a tense 4-2 decision.  Then the Crimson finished the year in singularly mediocre fashion.</span></p> <p><span>Not so Boston College.  Stung by academic suspensions, three top seniors--forward Joe Mullen, defenseman Joe Augustine and goalie Paul Skidmore--Len Ceglarski's crew had plummeted in the year's first half.  The Beanpot offered a chance to turn things around; B.C. did by upsetting Northeastern, 7-2, then pushing B.U. to the brink in one of the tourney's most exciting finals ever.  While they just missed out on a playoff berth, the revitalized Eagles finished the schedule strongly, grabbing seven out of nine Division One contests, including a 5-3 grudge match win over B.U.</span></p> <p><span>And when the 1978-80 season started, B.C. didn't stop.  After an inauspicious 5-4 overtime loss to Ohio State (hardly a hockey powerhouse), the Eagles ripped through the first ten weeks with only one loss in ECAC play to gain a secure position atop the Eastern Division and a third-place national ranking.  An 8-6 upset by Dartmouth last Wednesday ended B.C.'s eight-game winning streak, but the squad is flying.</span></p> <p><span>Credit for the B.C. resurgence goes to a balanced offensive attack, the leadership of captain Steve Barger, steady goaltending from Doug Ellis and the poised demeanor of a team that doesn't panic and relies on consistency and depth to overcome weaker clubs even when lacking intensity.</span></p> <p><span>While the defense, hurt early on by injuries to senior Charlie Antetomaso and sophomore Tom Wright (who have since returned), has been a question mark at times, Eagle forwards have shown great proficiency.  With 141 goals in 22 games (against 72 for opponents), B.C. averages more than six tallies per contest.  The big period for the Eagles all year has been the second, reflecting an ability to take a close game and break it wide open.</span></p> <p><span>Unlike the past four years, when all eyes focused on Joe Mullen's imposing talent, there are a number of forwards on whom B.C. now counts to supply firepower.  The Eagle most likely to succeed tonight would be Bill Army, in his last Beanpot on the way to finishing a distinguished college career.  The senior center from East Providence, R.I. casts spells with his stickhandling and conjures unexpected opportunities with his passing:  a master playmaker.  Second on the squad in scoring so far with ten goals and 17 assists (all statistics as of 1/31/80) in 19 contests, Army has notched 145 points (54 goals, 91 assists) in 107 games over three-and-a-half seasons.</span></p> <p><span>His linemates, Lee Blossom and captain Barger, are no slouches either.  A freshman left wing on a team dominated by upperclassmen, Blossom (14-10-24) has rocketed to the upper eschelons of the B.C. scoring stats.  Barger, the dark horse choice for captain, is steady at right wing, but most team members point to his off-ice leadership qualities as a key to the team's success.  As a walk-on freshman year, Barger spent a year with the subvarsity before seeing duty on the top squad as a penalty-killer the last two seasons.</span></p> <p><span>Billy O'Dwyer of South Boston, the team's leading scorer with 14 goals and 15 assists for 29 points, centers for linemates Mike Ewanouski (9-16-25) on the right and Brian Burns on left.</span></p> <p><span>Based on past experience, fans and Harvard defensemen should watch for the O'Dwyer combination if things get tight in the late going.  Against the Terriers January 18, probably the biggest game of the regular season for the Eagles, O'Dwyer evened the score at six apiece with just a few minutes left in regulation.  Then Ewanouski popped home a loose puck in overtime for B.C.'s first win ever at Walter Brown Arena.  \"I really enjoyed that,\" Ewanouski said recently, admitting that \"the effect was beginning to wear off\" two weeks after the fact.  You can bet B.U. still smarts.</span></p> <p><span>So, for that matter, does Harvard.  Billy Cleary's skaters remember well the 6-2 decision they dropped to B.C. January 9, a game closer than the final score and representative of both the strengths that have bolstered and the problems that have plagued the Crimson.</span></p> <p><span>First the positive.  \"We're not a big team,\" says Cleary, \"and we're not a physical team, but we're a scrappy team and a gutsy team.\"  During the first period, Harvard dominated play through sheer hard work, digging in the corners, forechecking and back-checking with authority, willing to spend 30 seconds fighting for a loose puck in order to set up an opportunity, rather than trying all game long for a picturesque goal.  The Eagles were caught off guard, and showed it.  Yet...</span></p> <p><span>...the score after one period was 2-2.  Harvard had nothing to show for probably one of the best periods it played all year; B.C., though taken aback by the aggressiveness of their opposition, adjusted accordingly and eventually wore Harvard down.  A frustrating evening for the Crimson.  Cleary:  \"We just haven't capitalized on the opportunities.  We've had good opportunities--I don't mean shots from the blue line or from behind the net, but real opportunities to score....\"</span></p> <p><span>The elusive goal, the failure to convert pressure into something that shows up on the scorecard, leaves a nagging anxiety even with a team, like Harvard, that is unified and confident of its own abilities.  \"That's the frustration,\" commented one player, \"you never know whether things are going to click or not.\"</span></p> <p><span>But if the Crimson doesn't always win--it stands at 4-10-1 overall, a more competitive 4-7-1 in ECAC.  One--they are consistently interesting.  Last year, a hodge-podge selection of weary veterans and green youngsters charted separate paths both on and off the ice, sliding, stumbling and skidding to a monotonously miserable 7-18-1 record (5-16-1 ECAC), the worst since Harvard hockey began in 1896.  \"The team didn't stick together,\" says sophomore goalie Wade Lau, expected to start tonight.  \"Some guys got to the point where they came into the locker room before a game wondering how many goals we were going to lose by.  When you accept losing, you're not going to win very often.\"</span></p> <p><span>Then came this year.  At first, the most obvious shift was geographical rather than attitudinal:  after a year of playing the interloper at B.U.'s Brown Arena, it was return of the native time as the newly renovated Alexander H. Bright Hockey Center (formerly Watson Rink) opened for business.  But the change became apparent in other ways.  The old guard, or most of it, had graduated (and standout defenseman Jackie Hughes went out for the U.S. Olympic Team).  A corps of hungry freshmen took its place.  The 1979-80 version of Harvard hockey is the youngest ever, with ten first-year men (including three of the top four scorers) on the squad.  Only four seniors--co-captains Graham Carter (forward-defense) and John Hynes (goalie) among them--remain.</span></p> <p><span>At its best this season--and there have been high points, like freshman left wing Dave Connors scoring with 45 seconds left in overtime to vanquish B.U., 4-3, December 5 and a team effort overcoming the University of New Hampshire, 4-1, six days later--the Crimson can play with anyone.  In molding and directing the energies of his youthful squad, Cleary must perform the hockey equivalent of a delicately controlled fusion reaction.  \"This is one of the best years I've ever had coaching,\" says the former Harvard, Beanpot and Olympic star.  \"I've never had so much fun.  The kids have been great, super.\"</span></p> <p><span>Yes, the \"kids\" are alright.  One freshman, defenseman Mark Fusco, leads the team in points with 17 (eight goals, nine assists), while another, opportunistic right winger Greg Olson (9-5-14) heads the goals department.  Other freshmen--particularly Jim Turner (4-11-15), the smooth left wing from Melrose who joins Olson and sophomore center Mike Watson (4-8-12) on the Crimson's second line--have also carved niches for themselves.</span></p> <p><span>In addition to the Watson-Turner-Olson connection, two other lines have remained relatively stable.  On line one, Burke (5-11-16) centers for junior right wing Tom Murray, one of the squad's best stickhandlers, and freshman Greg Britz, who replaced junior Rick Benson in late December.  Coach Cleary may decide to shift Britz before tonight's game.  Freshman wingers Derek Malmquist and Connors will likely join playmaking junior center Bob McDonald.  Look for Neil Sheehy, freshman brother of former NHLer Tim, to throw his weight around on a fourth line.</span></p> <p><span>For keeping the puck out of Harvard's net, Mitch Olson (Greg's brother) qualifies as Harvard's only true \"defensive defenseman.\"  Fusco, on the other hand, has solidified his hold on the right point of the Crimson power play with his booming slap-shots, and has been urged to give his game more balance.</span></p> <p><span>Finally, Wade Lau makes his Beanpot debut tonight.  Like B.C.'s Doug Ellis, Lau uses a loose style that relies more on instinct than form.  Between the twines for all but two Harvard contests, he has kept the Crimson in many games, but has also let in some inopportune goals.  His performances aginst B.U. and Vermont show that he reacts well to pressure, a necessary trait for any effective Beanpot competitor.</span></p> <p><span>But somehow, playing a big game against Vermont or even B.U. doesn't compare with the Beanpot.  The setting and the occasion elevate and magnify the strengths, weaknesses and importance of people and events.  So it is with the Beanpot--imagine your midterm rescheduled to the Taj Majal.  Both Harvard, winner of seven Beanpots, and B.C., which has won nine, feel due for another.</span></p> <p><span>In a few hours, one team will start wating for a week from tonight, the other for a year from tonight.  Like any game, Harvard vs. Boston College could be a blow-out, 6-2 or 8-1, the result never in doubt.  But it could also be one of those Beanpot classics they'll talk about when the next generation of Burkes and Laus and O'Dwyers and Antetomasos meet on Garden ice on the first two Mondays in February.  As nine o'clock approaches, all the ingredients are there--except perhaps the snow.  But remember, the blizzard was optional.<c><cred>Crimson<r>Nevin I.

{"title": "Primary Indifference in New Hampshire | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><i>Farmington, New Hampshire is neither Manchester nor Concord, and politicians won't be storming through every half-hour the way they will in the coming days before the February 26 primary.  A joke among reporters in Concord is that in 1976 when a reporter asked a local resident what he thought of Jimmy Carter, the man responded, \"I don't know.  I've only met him three times.\"</i></span></p> <p><span>The politicans don't come to Farmington, for the town is neither wealthy nor large.  There is none of the primary fever--no heightened anticipation of the outcome in Farmington that I have seen in other parts of the state.  When those few who do consider the primary important gather to talk politics, they speculate on the process as though they were spectators at a horse race, caring only to see who wins.</span></p> <p><span>For Farmington, the only acknowledgement of the primary was Chip Carter's visit to the town last October.  The president's son's visit to the shoemills and the town bar are still major topics of conversation.  The bar young Carter visited is the only liquor-licensed establishment in the area, owned by Vasilios, a fortyish Greek emigre and town sage.  \"He shook people's hands and he came and drank with us.  I will vote for Carter,\" Vasilios says as he sips his Michelob.  His mother-in-law Pauline, a beautiful vibrant blonde woman, nods in agreement.  Their bar is also a restaurant, cafe and nightclub--an area of the floor has been cleared for dancing and occasional couples parade their togetherness to a Kenny Rogers tune that was not meant for slow dancing.  Pauline, the bartender, worked in the town's shoemills for thirty years.  \"I think Carter is handling things well.  It took him a while, but it would take someone just as long to learn, and besides, who else is there?\"  she says to me.</span></p> <p><span>\"I think Carter has done the best one man can.  It's too big a job.  The last president that was great was Roosevelt,\" she adds.  She explains that Roosevelt brought the country out of the Depression and won the war.  No single man can make that kind of difference anymore, she tells me.  Pauline's fellow townspeople echo the sentiment again and again.  The apathy in Farmington stems not from the belief that a single vote would not change things, but that the winner could not make a difference.</span></p> <p><span>\"They're all meat,\" a man from Brookfield says.  \"It's just the difference between sirloin and chuck,\" he adds, laughing.  He explains that he won't give me his name because I have done nothing to prove that he can trust me.  The man is in his late thirties.  He tells me that he used to live in Massachusets and that he voted for Kennedy in 1960.  \"That's JACK Kennedy, mind you,\" as he pounds the table with his bottle of Michelob for emphasis.  He turns to watch Vasilios and Pauline close up the bar and says softly, \"Jack could have made a difference.\"</span></p> <p><span>The next morning three girls, as plump as dumplings, walk into Vasilios's bar, which at this time of day is called a cafe or restaurant.  They are teenaged sisters who are as round as their grandfather, Paul Blouin, the county chairman of the Democratic Party.  Paul Blouin knows every Democrat in Farmington, no small feat since nearly 7700 in the town's 8000 population belong to the party.  Paul practices politics over the counter and the phone, persuading people to register and vote.  Most of Paul's hassles come from getting people to register, especially the youth.</span></p> <p><span>His granddaughters sit at a separate table, talking with Pauline about school and boyfriends; Paul Blouin is an old boy politico.</span></p> <p><span>\"None of the kids are into politics, they don't really care,\" Brenda, the oldest, says.</span></p> <p><span>\"You're for Bush,\" the middle one and the roundest one says.</span></p> <p><span>\"I am not, I said maybe I was for Bush.  Politics is just boring,\" she says as she shows me a diamond engagement ring and tells me of her November wedding to the man she has been engaged to since she was 15.</span></p> <p><span>Paul shakes his head, a political addict who cannot understand why the rest of the town is not as hooked as he is.  Vasilios is among the few in Farmington who make an effort to understand what a candidate represents.  Reagan is popular because his ideology is \"good old American,\" the Greek says, with more than a twinkle in his eye.  In Farmington, Reagan stands for \"the continued stand of the U.S. as an aggressive power and the halt of Communism.\"</span></p> <p><span>In Vasilios's judgment, Carter is a good person, and besides, one can't forget that his son Chip drank under this very roof just last October.  A young barmaid serves the sage another Michelob and adds, \"Carter's a good solid religious man.  He's a peanut farmer.\"  As the barmaid Alicia stands in attendance listening, Vasilios turns to Kennedy.  \"He's not what his brothers were; he's a jerk.  He got kicked out of school, he plays with women, and then there's Chappaquiddick,\" Vasilios says dismissingly.  Alicia nods.  \"He's been a fuck-up all his life,\" she says, returning to the bar.</span></p> <p><span>If a Chappaquiddick-like incident had happened to one of the leading residents of Farmington, he would have to have lived with the talk and the judgments for the rest of his life.  Gossip and scandal create people's pasts in Farmington, and were Kennedy to run 20 years from now, he would not be able to escape the talk.  The judgment of Kennedy is brutal.  After 17 years in the United States Senate, he is judged by the nostalgic opinions of what his brothers were and could have been and the failure to control what Farmington believes men should be able to control--their families and their personal lives.</span></p> <p><span>\"If he couldn't get a girl across a bridge, how can we expect him to run the country,\" Ed Lynch, the former assistant fire chief, says with an air of finality.  Ed and his wife Ellie sit and drink with the man from Brookfield who laughs at my questions.  \"You just don't understand.  These people are living so close to the line--they don't even realize that they have been living in poverty for generations.  Politics doesn't help or matter.  There are people starving in Farmington.  They eat dog food.  The shifts at the car factory have been reduced from three to two.  Some say they may go down to one.  We need a war to start the economy,\" the Brookfield man explains.</span></p> <p><span>Ed interrupts:  \"The problem with the economy,\" he says, \"is that when these girls get pregnant, or when anybody needs money, they can just go on welfare and get food stamps.  These people should be working,\" he says loudly so they whole bar could listen.  He points to his wife.  \"We're American.  My clothes are American, and same with my beer.  To hell with all the foreign stuff.\"</span></p> <p><span>Ellie nods in agreement and says she never buys pistachios anymore because they come from Iran.  Ellie recently watched Lyndon Larouche, an ultra-conservative Democratic candidate on television, and she says he made a lot of sense--\"a lot more sense than the other candidates,\" and she wishes he would run for mayor.</span></p> <p><span>With Ellie's mention of Iran, talk switches to the draft and the possibility of war.  Everyone agrees with the large bulky woman, a former professiona1l golfer, who sits at the bar and says loudly, \"It's about time Carter did something, he should have done something a long time ago.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Of course I'd go,\" says Shermie, 20-year-old who works in his father's package store in town.  A chinless 19-year-old, clutching the arm of her middle-aged boyfriend who had both legs blown off in Korea, says, \"I'd just get pregnant.\"  The boyfriend looks at her coolly and nods to his wooden legs.  \"I would if I could,\" he says.</span></p> <p><span>The residents of Farmington support the draft and they would fight in a war, but they don't like to talk about it.</span></p> <p><span>Conversation drifts to marriages and the cost of heating oil.  Above the bar, on a color television screen, John Anderson talks with reporters in Washington about his campaign strategy for New Hampshire.  I interrupt two men arguing about last night's poker game to ask what they think of John Anderson.</span></p> <p><span>\"Who is John Anderson?\"  one asks me as he sips his draft and the primary seems very far away indeed.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Gunning for Oil | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b>N A CONVERSION as dramatic as that of Paul on the road to Damascus, Jimmy Carter has finally seen The Truth.  Or so one would believe after watching the network news and reading almost any paper over the past few weeks of jingoistic self-flagellation.  As ABC's \"America Held Hostage\" approaches its milestone Day 100, the nightly special seems more and more like the film clips Grumman Aircraft makes for the Pentagon.</span></p> <p><span>Carter \"has wrapped himself in the American flag, draft registration, and the politics of the cold war,\" as Alexander Cockburn and James Ridgeway of <b><i>The Village Voice</i></b> wrote last week.  He has understandably--in the context of the American political system--channeled the confusion to advance his reelection prospects, incapacitating his opponents by playing the \"Rose Garden Strategy\" and acting \"presidential\" to perfection.  The nationalism has been all-consuming; Americans have forgotten about banalities such as inflation.  As <b><i>The New Republic</i></b> put it:</span></p> <p><span>...the mullah and the mob have provided Jimmy Carter, vicar of Satan in their eyes, with a smokescreen for all the failures of his presidency:  inflation, energy policy, the increasing desperation of the poor, tax reform, an urban housing short-age, declining productivity.</span></p> <p><span>Arming the Persian Gulf region's monarchs with more weapons than they have soldiers to fire them may be the most politically appealing strategem, but it is probably the most ineffective way to safeguard American interests.  Carter has termed the area \"vital\" to the security of the United States, vowing to protect it militarily, along with Western Europe and Japan.  However, no number of American troops can maintain stability in the face of the resurgence of Moslem fundamentalism and the psychological dislocation of modernization.</span></p> <p><span>Blatant Soviet aggression is not likely to be the source of any instability in the near future.  The importance of the Gulf region to the West has long been implicit in American policy; the Soviets did not need presidential envoy Clark Clifford in New Delhi or Carter in Washington to say so.  The new, \"hawkish\" leaders in the Kremlin (if indeed they have taken over from the doddering Brezhnev) must realize that further military moves in the area would court a global conflict.  Even Henry Kissinger recognizes that the Soviets, no matter how devious they are, will hesitate before taking any new military action, and more likely will follow their armed offensive with a \"peace offensive\" to repair their image.</span></p> <p><span>The recent take-over of the mosque in Mecca--now known to be a well-organized attempt by Moslem fundamentalists to overthrow the Saudi leadership and not the isolated work of Shiite fanatics--showed that instability in the region is more likely to stem from domestic political unrest them from foreign intervention.</span></p> <p><span>The same grandiose economic plans and spending that tore apart Iranian society and drove the Shah from power now threaten other conservative societies in the Persian Gulf.  These oil-producing states have spent most of their revenues on the ambitious development of petrochemical and other heavy, \"prestige\" industries, to the neglect of traditional economic activities, like fishing, agriculture and cattle-raising, which would distribute oil wealth more widely.  As an article in <b><i>The New York Times</i></b> recently noted, \"with that neglect came the disruption of the lifestyle of large segments of the population, particularly of the Bedouins, who are the backbone of the gulf populations.\"  Moreover, the Saudis and Kuwaitis attending school in the Cambridges on both sides of the Atlantic are returning to find that, though they have the best educations that money will buy, their governments will not allow them to participate in decision-making.  Much of the recent surge in gold prices stems from insecure Persian Gulf monarchs on buying sprees, who, realizing their reigns will end soon, would rather retire in King Farouk-like opulence.</span></p> <p><span>In the face of domestic upheaval in the region, the key foreign policy question for America is not the absence of military power but its impotence.  America's experience in Vietnam attests to the efficacy of foreign intervention in a popular insurrection.  In fact, a more visible American military presence in the Persian Gulf would only associate friendly monarchs even more closely with a Westernizing United States, at a time when they are frantically seeking to dissociate themselves from it instead.</span></p> <p><span>Moreover, radicals could counter any American military action by mining the narrow Straits of Hormuz, through which practically all of the Persian Gulf oil flows to the West.  While two or three burning oil tankers in the waterway would be a fiery spectacle for American television viewer, it would not be a pretty sight for Western policymakers.  Although many American hearts would pound at the sight of our boys jumping off helicopters onto the Arabian sands, emotions don't light homes.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>RONICALLY, CARTER has resorted to flag-waving in order to hide his domestic failures, when solutions to these very problems--particularly that of energy--would best cure America's foreign policy headaches in the Persian Gulf.  The region is a vital American interest only because American greed has made it so.  To impose an emergency energy plan, complete with gasoline rationing, would be a far stronger policy than to reinstitute draft registration.</span></p> <p><span>An effective energy program must hurt, and it seems that the only presidential candidate who understands this fact of life is Rep. John Anderson (R-Ill.), who has proposed a 50-cent tax on gasoline.  Carter's aides have admitted to reporters that the country would undoubtedly be better off in a few years if the president imposed a hefty gasoline tax; however, they say he can't because of \"political\" considerations.  Carter has opted for a World War II-style rearmament drive that will only accelerate inflation.  He could just as easily have channeled the spasm of popular support that started with the taking of the American hostages in Tehran and has continued through the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan into a crash conservation program.</span></p> <p><span>In the 1970s, securing energy supplies emerged alongside checking Soviet expansionism as one of the overriding goals of American foreign policy.  While a strong military may be the only way to deal with the Soviets, tanks and paratroopers are certainly not a cheap or effective way to guarantee America's energy security.</span></p>"}

In northern New Hampshire, politics is a little like ice-racing.  Success lies in avoiding the spinning crashes, escaping from the crunching wrecks, collecting the most superficial dents.</span></p> <p><span>Case in point--Ted Kennedy, who here, like everywhere, is the man people want to talk about.  Three months ago, the checkered flag was his for the grabbing, and then the wide second turn and the slide--ice chips everywhere.  People liked him; Korea vet Ed, who was going to back him because \"he helps the old people who have to wrap themselves in newspapers to keep warm.\"  Or Marie, who will vote for Kennedy in her first election because \"he is a Kennedy--because his brothers were good.\"  Or Mike, who may not vote because \"it doesn't do any good.  If they want to draft me, they will, and I'll probably get my head blown off sticking up for my country.  Probably get my head blown off.  Right now Kennedy's trying to hold the draft off, so maybe I'll vote for him.  I drink a lot of booze, but if I go out there and get shot, I'm not going to be drinking any more.\"</span></p> <p><span>But most of the interest in Kennedy is pathological, even among the town's sorely outnumbered Democrats.  They speak of the man in the past tense, or if they speak to the future, it's about his chances of assassination.  The consensus is that Chappaquiddick did him in:  \"People remembered more than he thought they would,\" one man says, and he is right.  Jogging memories across the state, New Hampshire's biggest paper, The Manchester Union-Leader, last week ran the Washington Star series on Kennedy's dealings with long-legged rather mysterious Lana, a \"European countess.\"</span></p> <p><span>Once is trouble, Kennedy tried to push the gas to the floor instead of riding it out.  The Massachusetts senator's renunciation of the Shah did not go over too well.  Farmington is aggressively patriotic.  Bernie, at least 300 pounds of American, announces himself ready to go to war, perhaps in the paratroops.  A bar patron, deep in his cups, looks up simply to say \"Protests...No...Go to war.\"</span></p> <p><span>At the same time, Carter has carved his own high line through the curves.  \"Six months ago, I couldn't have bought a vote for Carter if I'd given out green stamps,\" Farmington Democratic committee chairman Paul Blouin announces.  Now, he's the leader.  People aren't happy about the war building in the Mideast, but they're not angry either.  \"He had no choice,\" one man says, whether the question deals with Iran of draft registration.  Carter has one other thing going for him in this small town--he \"had the courtesy,\" as one woman puts it, to send his son Chip to Farmington.  Chip, \"a very handsome boy,\" stopped in at the shoe mill, and then at Kristy's restaurant.  \"He drank a beer just like a regular guy,\" and that Moosehead alone probably won the incumbent a dozen votes.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE HAND-LETTERED sign in the window of Varnery's General Store, downtown Farmingon, reads:  \"Announcing!

IBM sold them their biggest computer, and it works so hard it heats the whole plant.\"  So now Ron works at home, packaging detergent and appliances in cardboard boxes in his kitchen so his wife can deliver them.  \"I may be making $10,000, but I'm doing it my way, and there's great potential for growth,\" he explains.

The subject is money, and ways to make it, and ways to lose it.  There's the story of the old man in the area who makes his living recognizing valuables in other people's junk, and the examples pour out--a Boston antique dealer who wrote out a $750 Check for a $40 clock, the booming market for old (and empty) bottles.  \"Never throw anything away,\" he says, sipping his coffee.  When he leaves, others finish his story.  Paul is an erstwhile real-estate developer--his goal to build a housing tract on a hillside the town wants to keep intact.  To cut property taxes on his home, he's built it underground.</span></p> <p><span>Paul and Ron are typical of many of the Republicans who wandered into the Crossroads Restaurant near Farmington for a cup of coffee last weekend.  The entrepreneurial spirit runs deep here, breeding widespread interest in money, and a no-nonsense conservatism.</span></p> <p><span>While the rest of the world stares at ABC-TV and the story of the hostages day 92, Paul says people in his part of the world are more concerned with inflation, with energy.  \"People say a loaf of bread is 89 cents, they talk about the way oil is up --those are the real things,\" he says.  The woodstove business in the area is booming, cordwood increasingly hard to find.  And almost every front door has been abandoned.  People insulate the opening with a sheet of plastic and walk around back to enter through the kitchen.</span></p> <p><span>What all this means for the New Hampshire primary is unclear.  People seem to like Ronald Reagan.  George Bush has the image of a self-made man, if he has any image at all.  More tellingly, though, there is a certain amount of support even among Republicans for one Lyndon Larouche, a \"Democrat.\"  Lyndon's workers (you may have seen them holding \"Nuclear power is safer then Kennedy's car\" signs in the Square), are persistent, and his campaign is well-greased.  A half-hour of free t.v. time to communicate his message last week earned him some interest.</span></p> <p><span>Even if he is seen as something of a conservative loony (except for the Reagan supporter who insisted that his plan for a world monetary system proved that \"he has a pink streak a mile wide\").  Larouche's politics are not that far from much of New Hampshire's.  \"If You Want to Get Government Off Your Bank and You Hate Drugs, Vote Larouche,\" the sign in front of his Concord campaign headquarters declares.  Whatever their feelings on drugs (limited usually to discussions of \"dope\" at the high school), most of Farmington couldn't agree more about federal bureaucracy.  \"I wanted to have a phone put in--I had to call Manchester, and they said to call Nashua and to Concord, and then back to Manchester, and finally I just gave up,\" Blouin recalls.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>LL OF WHICH is not to say that Larouche is going to get many votes at the end of the month--the people here are more sophisticated than that.  But campaigns (and voters) are often defined by their fringes, and many seem to wish that Larouche, or former New Hampshire governor Meldrim Thompson (running on the Constitution Party ticket) were truly in the race.  \"I wish Bill Loeb (the publisher of the Union-Leader, a fanatical conservative) would run,\" one old man declares.  \"I'd vote for him--he's an honest man.\"  The bedrock conservatism of the Granite State is as firm as any in the nation, fed by rational fears of high-priced meat and heating oil.</span></p>"}

This is an incorrect and dangerous impression.</span></p> <p><span>The audience seemed intimidated by the weight of authority and the presence of the Secret Service, but did break out into loud laughter when host Samuel Huntington stated that the purpose of the lecture series was to promote international harmony and peace.  Those questioners who were allowed to speak made rather timid objections, but one did manage to question the wisdom of supporting repressive dictatorships in opposing Communism.  In his answer, Brzezinski exposed a crucial flaw in his theory:  he stated that it does not really matter what happens to the people of Pakistan, as long as the structure of anti-Communist alliances is strong.</span></p> <p><span>Of course, the main reason this structure has always been weaker than its architects claimed, is that it has been accompanied by just such a disdain for the welfare of the huddled masses in the Third World.  We can see the result in Iran, when some of those masses have learned their true situation and risen up in selfawareness.  Mr. Carter in his news conference dimissed CIA intervention in Iran in 1953 as \"ancient history\" which need not be discussed.  Actually it is the root of the current hostage crisis, however outrageous the seizure of those hostages is in itself.</span></p> <p><span>Mr. Carter entered office auspiciously ignorant of foreign policy, and we can only assume Brzezinski's advice produced such evasion.  It follows a pattern of ignoring all root causes which would embarrass the U.S., but delving deep into the writings of Marx and Engels in order to reach negative conclusions about any Soviet moves, straining to ignore any defensive motives they may have.  Soviet troops never waged war beyond their borders without a rational defensive purpose--which is not, of course, to imply a moral right--until their Afghanistan foray; therefore it would be logical to inquire whether some defensive purpose might not be involved here too.  Frequent American outcries for military action to protect Persian Gulf oil, heard since 1973 and escalated with the hostage crisis, might constitute the real impetus for this ostensible aggression.  Even if not, U.S. aggressive moves have been frequent.</span></p> <p><span>But such admissions of American guilt or provocation, even the much more destructive episode in Viet Nam or Nixon's tilt toward Pakistani genocide in Bangladesh in 1971, are not part of Brzezinski's scheme.  Nor does he take into account widespread American economic imperialism, often depriving Third World peasants even of the very soil under their feet (see <b>Food First,)</b> by Lappe and Collins).  All evil is from the Soviet camp, he argues.  Therefore he will not apologize to Iran even for the sake of 50 American lives; and when I asked him why not, after his talk, he cited \"national pride\" as the reason.  Zbigniew Brzezinski is indeed a threat to world peace, and to the sanctity of individual lives, of whatever nationality. <b>John E. Chappell, Jr. '54</b></span></p>"}

In New Hampshire he is a maverick supporting gun control.

His willingness to state publicly his regret that he voted in favor of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution at a time of swelling militarist sentiment provides evidence that Anderson could resist the often overwhelming temptation to military intervention.  Furthermore, his many years of congressional experience offer another vital prerequisite for the office.</span></p> <p><span>But above all, Anderson understands the link between foreign and domestic problems.  His proposal of a 50-cent gas tax coupled with a cut in Social Security taxes indicates both intelligence and a desire to come to grips with the paramount issues of inflation and dependence on foreign oil.</span></p> <p><span>In addition, Anderson has supported the Equal Rights amendment, SALT II, federal aid to the poor to offset rising energy costs, and federal aid for abortion.  He has been a long-time supporter of civil rights; he has opposed development of the MX missile, the B-1 bomber, and a constitutional amendment to balance the federal budget.</span></p> <p><span>In sharp contrast to the rehashed cliches offered by his opponents, Anderson displays his own ideas and a will to implement them.  Unlike other Republicans in search of the presidential nomination, his is a voice of reason meriting attention.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Nuclear Countdown | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The overriding issue for me since 1945 has been control of nuclear weapons.  All issues, foreign and domestic--and in the United States the two cannot be disentangled--are judged by me in terms of the degree to which they contribute to increasing or decreasing the vulnerability of humankind to destruction both of its people and of its means of subsistence through a nuclear exchange and the increased proliferation of nuclear weapons.  Judged in these terms, the 1970s were a terrible decade.</span></p> <p><span>The partial Test Ban Treaty was signed in 1963, the weight of the anti-nuclear weapons movement in the United States (and also in the United Kingdom and elsewhere).  The majority of people who came of political age since that time, including the current editors of the Crimson and those to whom they speak among their fellow undergraduates, have not had nightmares about nuclear destruction--nightmares common among standard, in the early 1960s.  Since nuclear catastrophe has not occurred, it is not a salient issue for most younger politically concerned individuals.</span></p> <p><span>In the fight in favor of the hydrogen bomb (a single specimen of which completely flattened the island of Eniwetok in the Pacific and renendered it an uninhabitable, flat desert), Cold-War-oriented advocates of the hydrogen bomb sought to erase the distinction between large conventional weapons and small nuclear ones, so-called tactical nuclear weapons, by use of the cute term \"nukes\" to refer to these allegedly minor nuclear weapons.  Today to see the sign \"no nukes\" on the bumper stickers of Volkswagens and other cars driven by the educated elite at Harvard and elsewhere, brings back memories of that era of seeking to maintain the vital distinction between merely dreadful conventional weapons (which needlessly destroyed Dresden and fire-bombed Tokyo) and nuclear weapons capable through radiation as well as direct damage of the long-term destruction of life as we know it.</span></p> <p><span>\"No nukes\" now refers to what are in contrast the relatively minor dangers of nuclear power plants which offer environmentalist groups easy targets to attack corporate villains such as public utilities.  There are undoubted hazards in nuclear power, especially on the question of the disposal of nuclear wastes, but no serious physicist with whom I have discussed the issue (I spent several weeks at Oak Ridge in making myself less of an amateur on this issue) believes that even the most serious damage that, for example, might have resulted at Three Mile Island would be a calamity comparable to a major nuclear exchange.  Even a relatively small number of nuclear weapons now available in such overwhelming numbers is enough to make Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD) a deterrent to anyone who believes in Murphy's Law:  that if anything can go wrong, it will.  To hear Americans at the Salt II hearings discuss the possibilities of a first strike in which, as one put it, we could incinerate the Soviet Union, is terrifying.</span></p> <p><span>Such talk is terrifying in part because the Soviet Union already feels itself sufficiently threatened from within and without.  It has become a more dangerous adversary than it would under conditions of free trade under most-favored-nation status and greater American willingness to recognize that we must live on the same planet with this major nuclear power as they must live with us.  Hence, I have opposed the human rights doctrine of President Jimmy Carter form the very outset despite my full recognition of the terrible conditions of life in the Soviet Union, though far less terrible than in Stalin's era so that we know more about them and have more contact.  Dissidents are allowed to leave, rather than being executed.  Meanwhile, the Soviet Union faces a restless internal population, even less productive than we Americans, notably in agriculture; it faces possible dissension of its Moslem and other minorities which grow in numbers in the way growing, but more dangerously as it is allied with Moslem nationalism elsewhere.  It faces the restless \"people's democracies,\" and much of the alleged strength of the Warsaw Pact troops is not directed at Western Europe, most of whose responsible leaders favor the Salt II Treaty, but it is aimed to control increasingly or intermittently restless populations of these Warsaw Pact \"allies.\"</span></p> <p><span>For me, much can improve in the world, including human rights (which can be dealt with through quiet diplomacy as has been the case in protecting some of the dissidents in Yugoslavia and even in Chile) without the public humiliation and fear of internal explosion in what is still largely a passive population no longer numerically dominated by the Great Russian sector of the population.  To humiliate the Soviet Union and to take chances on whoever may be the successor to Brezhnev is extraordinarily destabilizing at a time when Pakistan appears to be expanding its nuclear potential, when Israel and even Japan evidently have nuclear weapons or at least the potential of building these, and which I think even of countries such as Libya and Iraq which would see no need to exercise restraint if the Soviet Union cannot agree on minimal restraint.</span></p> <p><span>Indeed, the seventies have been the period where the Middle East has been perhaps the main source of possible danger through a conceivable nuclear confrontation between the Soviet Union and the United States.  Endemic instability there was heightened when the Israelis, who had the chance for magnaminity after the Six Day War of 1967, might possibly have created an atmosphere of relatively benign feeling, not only vis-a-vis Egypt, but also vis-a-vis other adversary Arab states, by being willing to trade occupied land and the people in them for peace and secure boundaries.  In stead, a non-adversary state, namely Lebanon, has been shattered, and the lack of inventiveness and imagination as well as magnanimity among Israelis in power in effect helped prepare the ground for the 1973 war.  The stalemate within Israel now rests between the fanatical proponents of expansion and the very large number of Israelis who would be willing to trade land for an assured peace if they could secure a government capable of negotiating such a peace or even interested in it.  Many American Zionists, with notable exceptions on the Harvard faculty and elsewhere, have been captives of party line of the Israeli government in power.  As another consequence we see the heightened tension between some blacks and some American Jews for whom Israel and Southern Africa are symbols of international conflict, refracted from domestic politics and reflecting back upon the politics.</span></p> <p><span>Indeed, I would say that during the seventies, the United States has grown more truculent, more xenophobic, and more cut off from the rest of the world--though it is by no means the nation in defeat or retreat many claim it to be.  On the contrary, as the sale of bluejeans and jazz and rock and other popular records indicates, it is a model for much of the rest of the world which may attack us ideologically and envy us while imitating some of the features of our society which many educated Americans would consider our least attractive ones.</span></p> <p><span>The basic strength and well-being of the United States is not being built on increased nuclear weapons, or the MX missile which President Carter has had to promise in the hope--which may turn out to be in vain--of assuring the passage of a treaty which those truly concerned with disarmament on the Left attack as much too limited in scope.  It is now of such overriding symbolic importance, however, that its defeat in the Senate would seem to me to unravel what little fabric of international comity there exists, and possibly to force the Chinese and the Soviet Union back together again, for we are not the only ones who can play the \"China card.\"  I am in favor of a draft, or at the very least registration for the draft, to show that we are prepared if need be to defend ourselves by conventional weapons, since I do not believe this country sufficiently disciplined for the kind of active non-violent defense which professor Gene Sharp of the Center for International Affairs has brilliantly described in his writings.</span></p> <p><span>To the dismay of an internationalist like myself, nationalism has proven to be the strongest force in the world--a surprise and disappointment also to Marxists.  As long as this remains so, we must be prepared to defend our interests by domestic measures that will strengthen our economy through conservation, the use of nuclear power as an interim measure until we can develop still safer sources of energy (or else we shall fight a class war between the educated who want amenities and the less-educated who would also like amenities but who want first of all jobs and heat).  I would be very happy if our environmentalists and consumer advocates, such as Ralph Nader, called for a removal of the tariff from Japanese automobiles, for the import of Toyotas by others than the well-to-do the import reduce our consumption of vanishing fossil fuels.  Even more important is the rebuilding of our railroads rather than building more bombers when we already have ample means of delivery of nuclear weapons through our tripartite system.</span></p> <p><span>I have followed the single thread of nuclear weapons and attached some other strands to that thread to suggest a bleak view of the 70s.  This would be a one-sided picture for me personally, since I can think of more than one issue at a time.  The 70s have also seen what I regard as the mot significant cultural development of the decade:  namely, the women's movements in all their variety and, at times, short-sighted over-confidence leading to backlash.  The women's movements have affected not only the upper educated strata, but have filtered into the rest of the society and have, of course, affected men as well as women, and perhaps in some respects, more than women--not to speak of the children.  If we can live through the next years of nuclear weapons peril, and the dangers within this country of civil strife--what I sometimes think of as traffic jam litigious democracy--I can envisage benign futures which some wings of the women's movement foreshadow with their combined interest in nurturing the oncoming population of children and tough-minded realism about contemporary affairs.</span></p> <p><span>Contrary to what many think, I do not see the 70s as a period of greater conservatism among the educated, but of greater cynicism and mistrust, and also greater toleration-including tolerance for egocentricity and a pornography of violence--but also tolerance for minority groups and for women.</span></p> <p><span>The 70s are also a period, worldwide, both of intense nationalism and intense ethnic chauvinism, and the dangers of fragmentation which are not totally absent from these United States.  Yet we are still a vital country, the intellectual and artistic capital of the would, and if we can get through the next years and maintain a modest comity of nationality without xenophobia, there are many grounds for hope.  We must work for these, whatever our moments of despair, whether self-indulgent or prophetic.</span></p> <p><span><i>David Riesman '31 is Ford Professor of Social Sciences.</i></span></p>"}
{"title": "Energy Shock | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The major event in energy of the 1970s was the first oil shock, which resulted in the quadrupling of world oil prices and fundamentally changed the outlook for energy supplies.  In effect, the 1973-74 Arab reduction in oil output and embargo transformed Middle East oil from a low-cost, secure supply  to a high-cost, insecure source.  That event meant that the United States needed to adopt an energy policy that would recognize the increasingly higher value and cost of energy supplies.</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately, the U.S. has yet to adopt a policy that is appropriate to that challenge.  However, it is not surprising that it has taken so long to make relatively little progress in the energy area because of the vast sums of money involved, the varying perceptions of the Another major complicating factor is that different regions of the nation are fighting one another over the money involved.</span></p> <p><span>The second oil shock, which was brought about by the shutdown of the Iranian oil industry, has resulted in a telescoping of events that most experts thought would take 20 years to occur.  In other words, the doubling of world oil prices last year was not expected to take place until the year 2000 or beyond.</span></p> <p><span>There are only two choices before us in dealing with our energy problems.  One is to rely solely upon high energy prices to bring demand and supply into balance.  This policy would take quite a while to accomplish the nation's energy goals because, even with oil price decontrol, energy prices paid by the consumer will still be too low to reflect the real costs to the Moreover, taking this route would result in slower economic growth interspersed with recessions.</span></p> <p><span>The alternative policy is to increase the emphasis on raising the efficiency with which we use energy--in other words, place greater stress on conservation measures in  addition to higher energy prices.  Police would mean instituting very substantial financial incentives to encourage individuals and businesses to installing home insulation, storm windows and more energy efficient equipment, as well as investing in solar energy installations.</span></p> <p><span>A variety of solar energy installations would be included, such as roof panels for the heating of water; passive solar installations, in which buildings are designed to take advantage of the sun; small-scale hydroelectric plants; woodburning; and gasohol.  The financial incentives need to be coupled with an educational program, perhaps along the lines of the Agricultural Extension Service.  This second route, that is, the emphasis on energy efficiency, would be economically much healthier and result in substantially more economic growth than the first route.</span></p> <p><span>Right now, Congress would be willing to move much faster toward emphasizing greater energy efficiency if it received stronger leadership in this area from the White House.  Even though President Carter has emphasized the importance of conservation, conservation programs were sidetracked because of the massive synthetic fuel program that Carter proposed in mid-1979.  To the president's credit, however, he did make a tough, but very desirable, policy decision to decontrol oil prices.</span></p> <p><span>Keeping oil prices unrealistically low is an unsatisfactory way to aid the poor.  The rich use more energy in absolute terms than the poor, and, in relative terms, they consume almost as much when one counts indirect uses of energy, such as airplane travel.  It is better to pinpoint aid directly to the poor.  In fact, unrealistically low energy prices hurt all consumer because, over the long run, they cause the price of energy to be even higher than it would otherwise be.  As an explicit example, the price controls on oil since the 1973 \"OPEC Revolution\" are one of the reasons why the world oil price is as high as it is today.</span></p> <p><span><i>Robert B.

Jut as often, it displays an exciting, scrappy, hustling style that wears down opponents and evokes hope that this season won't end in the inevitable disappointment of recent years.</span></p> <p><span>It's the hot-and-cold Harvard University hockey team, which this weekend split a pair of crucial ECAC Division I confrontations at Bright Center, rebounding from a frustrating 43 overtime loss to the University of Vermont Friday night to overwhelm Brown, 9-5, the following afternoon.</span></p> <p><span>Three Crimson skaters--defenseman Mark Fusco (four assists), and leftwingers Jim Turner and Dave Connors (two goals and two assists each)--led the way in Saturday's offensive explosion, which broke Harvard's five-game losing streak and took some of the edge off Friday night's let-down ending.</span></p> <p><span>More importantly, the win left Harvard with a 4-4-1 ECAC Division I record (4-7-1 verall) and a very plausible shot at post season play, while relegating Brown (3-8-2 overall, 2-5-2 ECAC Division I) to the dregs of the Ivy Division.</span></p> <p><span>Against UVM (now 5-2 in Division I) Harvard trailed 2-0 after two periods that could charitably be described as loose, then roared into the lead with three rapid-fire tallies in the opening 3:38 of the third.</span></p> <p><span>Tom Murray's superb individual effort, which culminated with the rightwinger barreling into the net just after flicking the puck over Catamount goalie Sylvian Turcotte, fired up the Crimson just eight seconds into period three.  Freshman Fusco followed with a blast from the point which caught the net above Turcotte's shoulder, and Bob McDonald short-hopped home a Fusco rebound to make it 3-2.</span></p> <p><span>But Vermont center Tom Cullity vaporized the comeback, tying the contest on a deflection with 12:40 left in regulation and winning it on a wristshot from the slot 8:04 into the ten-minute sudden-death overtime.  The decisive goal, set up by leading UVM scorer Craig Homola and standout defenseman Louis Cote, came 1:34 into Harvard co-captain Graham Carter's charging penalty.  Sophomore netminder Wade Lau, who kept the Crimson in the game during the early going and performed well all weekend, had no chance on the play.</span></p> <p><span>When Cullity's shot stretched the twine high to Lau's right Harvard's ECAC record dropped below .500 for the first time all season, and made defeating Brown a virtual necessity.  The few veterans on this year's freshman-dominated squad could recall the first Saturday in January a year ago, when the Bruins trudged into Brookline and skated Harvard into the Walter Brown Arena ice, 7-3, before a national T.V. audience.  Likewise, the prospect of a six-game losing streak did not appeal to the Crimson.</span></p> <p><span>\"After five straight you can get into a rut and forget what winning feels like,\" commented Lau.  \"You begin to expect it.  Last year, the team accepted losing very well, but we won't.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"They really kicked us when we were down last year,\" said Dave Burke, who also remembered.  \"This time we felt, let's take it to them.\"</span></p> <p><span>Harvard did.  The Crimson's nine-goal barrage began only 19 seconds after the opening faceoff when freshman goalhound Greg Olson rapped in the rebound of his brother Mitch's slapshot after the puck rebounded off the boards behind the Bruin net.  It didn't end until Connors, another freshman, sailed a backhander past Erci Eisendrath at 10:34 of the third period, just five seconds after Eisendrath replaced Mark Holden, Brown's starting goaltender.</span></p> <p><span>In between, the Crimson skaters unveiled a ferocious forechecking game that resulted in numerous opportunities in the Brown zone--and, as a by-product, exposed Lau to fast breaks in the other direction and 34 shots on the day.  Harvard's attack was spread evenly among the top three lines--Turner, Mike Watson and Greg Olson, Greg Britz, Burke and Murray, Connors, McDonald and Derek Malmquist--as 11 players contributed a point or more.</span></p> <p><span>A slapshot from Burke, who patiently waited at the point for the right moment to uncork, McDonald's conversion of a cross-ice pass from Connors, and Greg Olson's short-handed goal made it 4-2 Harvard after one.  Brown cut the margin to one, but McDonald and Connors struck again 36 seconds apart, and the Crimson never looked back.  Ahead 6-3 after two, the Crimson coasted the rest of the way.</span></p> <p><span><b>Gathering</b></span></p> <p><span>\"We have to get it into our minds,\" said Burke, \"that we have to play 'our' game every game and not let the other team define the style of play.  We have to go out and play with confidence.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"It's hard to say,\" said Turner, when asked why the team plays so well at some times and not-so-hot at others.  \"Something just clicks.\"</span></p>"}

{"title": "National Insecurity | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b>N 1977, Pakistani diplomatic officials contacted John A. Phillips, a Princeton University student, and asked him for a copy of the atomic bomb blueprints he had made as part of his junior project.  Phillips told the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Sen. William Proxmire (D-Wisc.) about the incident.  When pressed about the incident, a Pakistani aide said there was nothing \"sinister or underhand\" about the request.  However, Proxmire noted that the incident highlighted the desperation of some nations for nuclear weapons and the importance of adopting an effective non-proliferation policy.</span></p> <p><span>In the 1980s, the greatest threat of nuclear war lies with the newly industrializing, politically unstable Third World nations, who are actively seeking to join the so-called Nuclear Club and who are rapidly developing the capability to do so.  For beleaguered countries such as South Africa and Israel, the Bomb represents the ultimate security in a hostile world.</span></p> <p><span>The leaders of many of these countries, who aspire to make their nations global powers, believe they must have nuclear weapons to do so.  And regional rivalry spurs others to seek atomic bombs, as in the case of India (a nuclear have) and Pakistan (a nuclear almost-have).</span></p> <p><span>A nuclear bomb would obviously enhance the power of any terrorist group.  With the emergence in Iran of terrorism as a foreign policy instrument of the \"responsible\" nation-state, the danger of nuclear terrorism has become more real.</span></p> <p><span>The United States will not be able to eradicate the reasons these nations want the Bomb.  At best, the U.S. can relieve these national insecurities by guaranteeing their defense, as in the case of South Korea.  But the U.S. cannot provide this protection to all.  Moreover, attempts to restrict the spread of bomb building know-how have failed:  If a junior at Princeton can design a bomb, and a journalist can find the plans to one in a public library, any nation can.  As a result, American policy should focus on limiting the spread of the plutonium that is the prerequisite of any nuclear weapon as the only way to curb proliferation.</span></p> <p><span>The key to restricting the spread of weapons-grade plutonium is to limit the spread of nuclear breeder reactors, which produce plutonium, and reprocessing plants, which extract plutonium from the spent fuel rods of conventional reactors.  President Carter has tried to pursue this policy--in exactly the wrong manner.  Many harder hit by OPEC's price hikes than any industrialized country, less developed nations, see nuclear power as the only hope for attaining energy self-sufficiency.  These had depended upon the United States to develop the breeder reactor and nuclear fuel reprocessing technologies for them to guarantee a future supply of nuclear fuel.  However, with the best of intentions, Carter slowed American research on the breeders and the reprocessors.</span></p> <p><span>These Third World nations have discovered that the United States is about as reliable a source of energy as the Arab oil exporting states.  Having already invested considerable money and prestige in nuclear power plants and seeing no alternative energy source, the leaders of these countries sought to build their own breeders and reprocessing plants.</span></p> <p><span><b>C</b>ARTER'S ATTEMPT to clamp down on the export of nuclear technology to Third World nations has met with little success.  A number of the United States' allies, notably France and West Germany, have been all too willing to step into the void and to supply expertise and equipment to nations such as Iraq and Brazil.  Moreover, last fall a conference of 66 nations and five international organizations, which Carter convened to strengthen his non-proliferation campaign, concluded world-wide development of the fast breeder reactor should go ahead despite the dangers of nuclear weapons proliferation.</span></p> <p><span>By failing to develop the breeders, the U.S. has forfeited the trust of the Third World in America's reliability as a fuel supplier.  Now the U.S. will have to change tactics.  As a first step, the U.S. should seek to create an international agency, perhaps under the auspices of the United Nations, to develop solar and other energy technologies appropriate for the special conditions of resource poor, less developed countries.  In many of these nations, sunlight is the most abundant natural resource.  While a bank of photo-electric power cells might be inappropriate for capital-poor developing countries, solar water heaters and buildings designed to take advantage of the sun could make a substantial contribution towards meeting these countries' energy needs.  A multilateral agency could finance the development of these technologies and provide low-cost, long term loans to disseminate them.  Perhaps the Organization of Oil-Exporting Countries, which has been searching for a way to aid the developing countries could join in such an effort.</span></p> <p><span>The U.S. should adopt an energy program to slash its own oil consumption and so to alleviate upward pressure on petroleum prices in world-markets, which in turn compels developing countries to chose nuclear power.  Ideally such an American program should include the decontrol of oil and gas prices (accompanied by tax relief for the hardest-hit consumers), the development of mass transit, and the adoption of solar power and conservation measures, which a group at the Business School recently said could cut the nation's energy consumption by 30 to 40 per cent.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>MERICAN NUCLEAR non-proliferation policy will have to avoid the self-righteousness that so often pervades U.S. relations in other areas with the Third World.  American policymakers cannot justify their campaign against nuclear power in the Third World while building more reactors at home.  And the United States cannot tell the leaders of newly industrializing nations they cannot have nuclear weapons while President Carter reaffirms their importance in world politics by increasing America's own nuclear arsenal.</span></p> <p><span>The leaders of these Third World countries can now only interpret American nuclear non-proliferation policy as another attempt to preserve the existing imbalance in world power and to deny them the benefits that the industrialized nations have long profited from.  Success in the attempt to stem the proliferation of nuclear weapons throughout a politically unstable Third World depends upon U.S. recognition that these countries are no longer second-class world citizens.  As such, the United States must sacrifice a bit before it can expect developing nations to do the same.</span></p>"}
{"title": "A Crossroads | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>HE INTERVENTION of Soviet troops in Afghanistan, ostensibly at the request of the Afghan government, was an act of international aggression rightly condemned by American leaders, their allies and several Third World governments.</span></p> <p><span>No leap of the imagination can substantiate charges by Tass, the Soviet press agency, that the presence of 50,000 Soviet troops in Afghanistan is a response to American \"cold war\" policies.  Whether Soviet leaders decided to move in on Afghanistan because they feared the Moslem rebellion there would spread to the large Moslem minority in the Soviet Union, or whether the intervention is the first step in Soviet expansionary designs on the Middle East, the act shows the bankruptcy of Soviet claims to be the Third World's benefactor.</span></p> <p><span>The measures President Carter has taken thus far to register American outrage at the intervention--economic responses, including reductions in grain sales and high technology assistance, and symbolic responses, like the reduction in embassy staffing--make their point well enough:  that if Soviet leaders resort to military force to pursue their interests abroad, they will forfeit many of the benefits of detente.  Food should not be used as a political tool when its denial might cause starvation, but in this case Carter's action will demonstrate to the Soviets that America is willing to sacrifice profitable grain deals in protest.</span></p> <p><span>But to oppose ratification of SALT II because of the events in Afghanistan is to invite further Soviet aggression by telling the Soviet Union that heightened military competition is what the United States wants.  To delay the arms limitation debate in the current sabre-rattling climate may be a wise tactical move for Carter; but SALT and the years of negotiation it represents are still the best hope for world peace.  Dumping the treaty now would neither hurt the Soviets nor further U.S. interests.</span></p> <p><span>The Pentagon has used the emotions aroused by the Soviet aggression to win agreement on military spending increases that would otherwise be unthinkable; especially in an inflationary economy.  The bloated military establishment needs more discipline, not more money.  Experience proves that added billions for more military hardware do not guarantee the safety of American interests abroad.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE UNITED STATES is at a crossroads in its foreign policy:  it can either re-subscribe to the principles that brought two decades of cold war, Korea and Vietnam, or try something new.  The old policies have brought nothing but failure; if, for once, the U.S. shuns a knee-jerk military response, it will both salvage its foreign policy goals and leave open a path to world peace.</span></p> <p><span>The United States should not supply arms to the Moslem rebels in Afghanistan, whatever the merits of their cause, and should not start selling arms to Pakistan, a military dictatorship which may well be working on its own nuclear system.  Instead, the U.S. should take the crisis as a chance to show its Third World critics that it does not always live by the sword.</span></p> <p><span>If the Soviets confirm the charges of cold warriors, who say the Afghanistan invasion is part of a master-plan to seize Middle Eastern oil, then America will have to face the possibility of military responses.  But no vital American interests have been threatened in Afghanistan, which has had a pro-Soviet government for two years now.  If the Soviet troops leave Afghanistan once their puppet government is secure, all the military rhetoric being spouted today in Congress and the White House will look ridiculous.  Afghanistan offers us a clear choice:  old reflex responses that got us into our present bind, or new approaches that leave some way out.</span></p>"}
{"title": "A Necessary Step | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>HE SOVIET INVASION of Afghanistan ranks as one of the most cynical and brutal violations of sovereignty in recent years.  To aid Afghan insurgents fighting Soviet aggression and to prevent the repetition of such aggression elsewhere, the United States must take strong measures including arming Afghan rebels and Pakistan to raise the cost of invasion for the Soviet Union to prohibitive levels.</span></p> <p><span>While the economic measures that President Carter has ordered represent a necessary first step in expressing our outrage to the Soviet Union, they alone will be completely ineffectual in blocking the spread of war.  The partial grain embargo will only inconvenience the Soviet society.  And in the short run, Soviet stockpiles of grain will further cushion the blow.  The technology blockade will have even less effect.  The United States is the Soviet Union's supplier of last resort for all high technology and currently does less than one quarter of the trade that Japan, the Soviet Union's leading western trade partner, does annually.</span></p> <p><span>Such measures are wonderful ways to express our discontent with the way the world works, but they offer small and non-aligned nations no security and ultimately no guarantee that either big power will ever eschew the use of military force to overthrow legitimate governments.</span></p> <p><span>It would be nice to believe that measures producing largely symbolic impact will impress the Soviet Union enough to block further aggression, will reassure non-aligned nations that their territorial integrity is taken seriously.  But the end result--a successful and largely cost-free Soviet annexation of another nation--will destroy any of the long range hopes for peace that proponents of economic measures alone may hope to gain.  Instead of encouraging peace, such an outcome will highlight the benefits of war.  While it is imperative that the U.S. must not force a cold war, us-against-them military confrontation, it is equally vital that the U.S. be willing to offer the means of self-defense to nations threatened by Soviet expansionism.  In this crisis, the U.S. should respond to requests supported by a broad range of odd international bedfellows by Pakistan and, most importantly, by the Afghan resistance fighters.</span></p> <p><span>It is clearly inappropriate at this time to engage in strategic arms sabre rattling or to expand dramatically the U.S. military establishment; neither foreign policy gains nor military advantage can be garnered in this way.  However, cooperation on such matters as SALT is essential and should continue, but detente as a whole becomes a dead letter if the fruit of the policy is such actions as the Afghanistan invasion.  Similarly, direct U.S. military intervention is wholly inappropriate; the U.S. must preserve the distinction between itself and the U.S.S.R. and avoid the use of its own military forces to destroy a nation.</span></p> <p><span>The Soviet Union has clearly demonstrated that its claims to be the \"defender of the third world\" are tripe.  The U.S. should demonstrate that its \"concern\" will be translated into real benefits and genuine support for Afghanistan and other potentially threatened nations.</span></p>"}

The action that sets off the universe-threatening troubles in <i>Alternative</i> is an American embargo on grain sales similar to the one Carter ordered last Friday.  If we're in for a two weeks anything like that which President William Matthew's nation edures, better look into buying real estate in a remote area--like Venus.</span></p> <p><span>But for all its similarity to contemporary politics, Forsyth has not written a great book, nor as good as his first novel, <i>The Day of the Jackal.</i>  Forsyth crafts plots, and he does so better than virtually any other thriller-writer around.  Plots need people, however, and that is where the troubles start.</span></p> <p><span>Forsyth could never create a George Smiley, the hero of John Le Carre's series that began with <i>The Spy Who Came in From the Cold.</i>  However convoluted his adventures, Smiley provides an anchor for every Le Carre story because he is a real person--a troubled, depressed, aging spy.  Forsyth deals in Supermen, plastic men whom we will root for but never really care about as human beings.  He came closest in <i>Jackal,</i> with his portrayal of the man who tried to assassinate Charles De Gaulle; he failed outright in his two later novels, <i>The Odessa File,</i> in which Superman infiltrated a society of Nazi war criminals, and <i>The Dogs of War,</i> in which Superman directed a <i>coup d'etat</i> in a small African nation.</span></p> <p><span>The hero this time is Adam Munro, a British spy working under cover in his nation's embassy in Moscow.  Pretty straight arrow this Munro, all the right schools, the right background, except for a short, passionate fling with a Russian beauty during the Berlin crisis.  But she \"slipped back into the East through the last uncompleted section in the Wall, sad and lonely and heartbroken--and very, very, beautiful.\"  Never to be seen again.  Suuuuure.</span></p> <p><span><b>F</b>ORSYTH MOVES THE action around the globe every few paragraphs until we learn that the Soviet grain crop has failed almost completely because the red bureaucracy fouled up.  The folks in the Zil limousines, especially the Brezhnev-clone Soviet premier, Maxim Rudin, are not amused, and Rudin's Kremlin rivals want to use the crisis to get the old curmudgeon bounced.  Back in Washington, Bill Matthews and Assistant for National Security Affairs, Stanislaw (read Zbigniew) Poklewski, and Secretary of State David (read Cyrus) Lawrence want to use the shortage to wring concessions out of the Russians.</span></p> <p><span>And then there is Andrew Drake.  A mild that Ukranian nationalism will be his cause for his fourth book.  Perfect vehicles for displaying the author's well-known and rabid hatred of the Soviets, Drake and his crew of \"freedom fighters\" make the moves that turn the grain shortage into possible Armageddon.  There is something disturbing about the terrorist-as-hero syndrome so pervasive in contemporary thrillers, but with writers struggling to match newspaper headlines, they seem compelled to have characters willing to use extremism in defense of their vision of liberty.</span></p> <p><span>Not wanting to miss any big-new-story bases, Forsyth throws in the maiden voyage of the world's biggest oil tanker, the <i>Freya,</i> hauling one million barrels of crude into Rotterdam.  Anyone who has ever read a book or seen a movie knows as soon as you hear \"maiden voyage,\" you better reserve a seat on the lifeboat.  The ship and the Kremlin and the Ukranians and the White House all begin high-speed confrontations and near confrontations as Forsyth builds the tension.  Which he does brilliantly.  He spends several paragraphs in each location and uses almost cinematic cuts, back and forth, the intervals growing shorter as the action grows more frenzied.</span></p> <p><span><b>O</b>F COURSE, there are the characteristic Forsyth touches that, despite his faults, make him a reliably entertaining read.  An important Forsyth character would never deign to walk through the front door of a famous building; the author's knowledge of the innards of 10 Downing Street, the White House and, most impressive of all, the Kremlin, add immeasurably to the sense of reality.  Superb mannered pillar of the English middle class.  It is at first hard to understand what this man is doing among all these movers and shakers.  We soon learn:  \"Andrew Drake, despite his Anglicized name, was also a Ukranian, and a fanatic.\"  Forsyth decides Bond-like gadgets also appear in delicious profusion, including a personal favorite, the \"flash-bang-crash grenades,\" which blind anyone looking at them, blow out their eardrums, and \"cause a ten-second paralysis.\"  Just ten seconds?</span></p> <p><span>The climax does not disappoint.  The activities surge to a wild crescendo with everything from the fjords of Norway to the world's fastest airplane integrated into the resolution.  Forsyth has indeed fashioned a thriller, where--don't be deceived--the surprises keep coming until the very last page. If only he could portray a human being with the same verve and insight with which he calls forth a \"short-barreled pump-action shotgun.\"</span></p>"}
