{"title": "'Juno' Has Arrived | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>No one should have known about it.  The painting should have been slipped silently into the back of the Fogg at a time undisclosed to the public.  It should not have been opened until the proper fanfare could be mustered.</span></p> <p><span>But Armand Hammer, perhaps the world's most flamboyant businessman even at the age of 77, didn't want it that way.  He wasn't content with presenting \"Juno\", his recently purchased $3.25-million Rembrandt, without a touch of the swashbuckler.</span></p> <p><span>So Hammer, active chairman of Occidental Petroleum, and his wife Francis, came to the Fogg yesterday with the painting, and the publicity and the needless security risks.  And everybody had a very good time.</span></p> <p><span>Hammer made it clear at the outset that he was lending Harvard the painting for a three-month show beginning Thursday only because he wanted to please his \"dear friend\" Seymour Slive, director of the Fogg.</span></p> <p><span>\"He [Slive] was disappointed that the painting was at the Metropolitan Museum all those years--this is the only thing I could do for our friendship,\" Hammer explained about his decision to bring the painting to the Fogg immediately after he purchased it.</span></p> <p><span>But the three-month presentation of Juno - the most expensive Rembrandt ever purchased -- isn't all that Harvard stands to gain out of Hammer's presence.</span></p> <p><span>As Slive ushered Hammer through the halls and bowels of the Fogg, past the museum's tremendous collection of Impressionists and its awesome restoration facilities, it became clear that Hammer may be interested in helping Harvard out in other ways as well.</span></p> <p><span>For instance, after viewing the University's extensive collection of reserves--paintings that only students get to see because the Fogg doesn't have enough wall space, Hammer said he would consider giving some money towards the construction of a planned $17 million Fogg addition to house the objects.</span></p> <p><span>And, considering Hammer's extensive relations with the Soviet Union--he has had dealings with Russian leaders as diverse as Lenin and Trotsky and was the motivating force behind a huge phosphorus deal with the Soviets several years ago--it didn't come as any surprise when he said he would give money to the current Russian Research Center Fund Drive.</span></p> <p><span><b>Oohs and Aahs</b></span></p> <p><span>But most of the fun was reserved for the Hammers as they oohed, aawed, and gee whizzed their way through the Fogg's Renoirs, Daumiers and, of course, Rembrandts.  \"You've got a treasure house here,\" Hammer told Slive.  \"A small Hermitage.\"</span></p> <p><span>The Wertheim Collection of Impressionists brought out the story-teller in Hammer.  After hearing Slive discourse on how Van Gogh's art was considered degenerate by the Nazis, Hammer related a story about his newly-purchased Rembrandt.</span></p> <p><span>He mentioned that Juno was in the basement of a Bonn museum in 1934 when Hitler decided that all paintings that weren't Rhenish should be sold.  An astute collector snatched up the painting for 900 Marks, or $214.  \"We got even with Hitler,\" Hammer said of the deal.  \"That's all he got out of it.\"</span></p> <p><span>But during his hour-long tour Hammer remained the consummate businessman--even taking phone calls, one of them from Columbia's Soviet scholar and Carter adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski to arrange a meeting later that afternoon, presumably to discuss Soviet-American relations.</span></p> <p><span>On the subject of those relations, Hammer recalled an encounter he once had with Trotsky, a man he used to debate about the Communist and capitalist systems.</span></p> <p><span><b>Trotsky Offer</b></span></p> <p><span>Trotsky, he said, told him, \"You know we want you to take a concession in Russia.\"  At the time Hammer says he was a little nonplussed, unsure about what Trotsky had in mind.  Until, he says, Trotsky added, \"But when the revolution comes in America, we will take it all back.\"</span></p> <p><span>Although Hammer is far past traditional retirement age, William McSweeny, president of Occidental International, who accompanied the Hammers on their trip said, when asked whether Hammer still runs the show at Occidental, \"You bet your life, he does.\"</span></p> <p><span>Even though University Police Chief David Gorski said that Hammer's flair made it more difficult to safeguard the painting, Gorski acknowledge yesterday that the affair was all Hammer's, and he wasn't about to quarrel with a gift horse</span></p>"}
{"title": "Harvard Study, UHS Disagree On Swine Flu | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Officials at the University Health Services will advise all undergraduates to be vaccinated against swine flu in sharp contrast to Massachusetts policy and to a just-completed Medical School study that will recommend against mass immunization of young adults.</span></p> <p><span>UHS hopes to offer the controversial vaccine to \"high-risk\" patients--those over 65 or with chronic illnesses--late in October, and to the rest of the University community two or three weeks afterwards.  In line with federal policy, the clinic will urge all but children to roll up their sleeves for the vaccine.</span></p> <p><span>The state department of public health, on the other hand, will recommend the vaccine only to high-risk groups, suggesting other citizens weigh the risks and benefits for themselves.</span></p> <p><span>\"There is no medical evidence to justify a mass program,\" Tony Dutra '74, head of the Massachusetts swine flu project, said yesterday.</span></p> <p><span>The Harvard study, appearing today in the New England Journal of Medicine, estimates the cost-effectiveness of a mass immunization program and concludes that vaccination makes sense for most adults.</span></p> <p><span>But last night Stephen C. Schoenbaum, assistant professor of Medicine at the Peter Bent Brigham, Hospital and one of the study's directors, said, \"I would prefer to immunize young adults under 25 only if they have some chronic illness.\"</span></p> <p><span>Sholem Postel, associate director of UHS, said last night that he had not seen the Harvard study, but said it was unlikely to prompt UHS to alter its plans.</span></p> <p><span>Clinical trials this summer showed the swine flu vaccine to be considerably less effective among young adults than among older people.  The vaccine successfully produced antibodies in about 50 per cent of subjects under 25, compared to a success rate of 70 to 90 per cent in the older population.</span></p> <p><span>In addition, the Harvard study compiled its figures before the federal government revealed that what may be a crucial component of the vaccine is missing.  No one has yet explained what slip-up in the manufacturing process caused the vaccine to be produced without neuraminidase, an enzyme some scientists believe important in triggering a second-line defense to the disease.</span></p> <p><span>Postel said that the clinic is recommending immunization as a \"general public health measure,\" but that it might be \"reasonable\" for an individual student to postpone vaccination until--and unless-swine flu reappears.  When asked whether such a position might discourage student response, Postel said, \"You're not kidding it will.\"</span></p> <p><span>The swine flu program has been shrouded in controversy from its inception.  Last March, President Ford recommended a crash program to vaccinate \"each and every American\" against swine flu, after one soldier died in an isolated outbreak of the disease at Fort Dix.</span></p> <p><span>Critics, including a minority of state health officials, Ralph Nader's Health Research Group (HRG), The New York Times, and health officials and medical journals in England, France and Canada, have disputed government estimates of the likelihood of an epidemic, its probable severity and the effectiveness of the vaccine itself.</span></p> <p><span>Sidney Wolfe of the HRG said this summer, \"The major disease in the U.S. this year related to Fort Dix will not be swine flu but, rather, swine flu vaccine disease.\"  The Lancet, a respected British medical journal, concluded that the swine flu virus \"seemed to be not very good at infecting man and may have died out as a result\" and implied that the U.S. response to a minimal danger,\" and suggested that the government stockpile the vaccine and administer it only if swine flu reappeared.</span></p> <p><span>The government has responded to that suggestion by claiming that given the logistics of mass immunization, 12 weeks or more might elapse between the initial discovery of swine flu and the protection of the American population--too long to stave off an epidemic.</span></p> <p><span>But Dutra estimated that his office could \"get the vaccine into people's arms\" three to five weeks after swine flu appeared, which Dutra said would be \"plenty of time,\" because even if swine flu returns it will probably do so in small, sporadic outbreaks.</span></p> <p><span>\"There is absolutely minimal to the nth power chance of a pandemic this winter,\" he added</span></p>"}
{"title": "The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The boisterous provincial cities of Turin and Catania in <i>The Seduction of Mimi,</i> with their bossist politics and over-blown romantic intriques, provide the first, and the best, showcase for the talents of Lina Wertmuller.  Her fluky--sometimes maudlin, sometimes racy--rhythm and pacing, the continual yak-yakking of her argumentative protagonists, even her crude flights of comical fancy all seem to fit in these cities.  Here adults must act fast and foolishly in order to sustain the belief that their fierce chauvinism, mafioso loyalty and marital code of honor still mean anything in their industrialized, bureaucratized world.</span></p> <p><span>This precarious life seems just right for Giancarlo Gianninni's face.  His pout--pained, bewildered, yet still bemused--expresses perfectly the exasperation of a would-be romantic with nothing but compromised causes to champion.  And when Gianninni beds with a town official's voluminous wife to repay her husband for cuckolding him, even the eyefull of female rear end Wertmuller gives us--sexist as it is--manages to drive home its grotesque point amidst this old order gone modern and absurd.</span></p> <p><span>These same elements fly out of hand, and for the most part into bad taste, in Wertmuller's <i>All Screwed Up,</i> a story of two happy-go-lucky working men who fall in with a band of greedy, manipulative working class women who operate a boarding house.  Before getting too enthusiastic about Wertmuller, see this film:  the characters are one-sided, the construction is sloppy and the ultimate lesson to be drawn would have appeared simplistic if Wert-muller hadn't lost it along the way.</span></p> <p><span><i>All Screwed Up</i> does have a few clever scenes:  during one in particular a worker finally makes love to his reluctant bride when, in the midst of his hot pursuit, a television falls and she has to thrust her arms defenselessly behind her head to keep the set from smashing.  Even this bit may upset some, and the over-all tenor of the film is probably exemplified better by a bizarre \"dance\" of beef carcasses in a slaughter house, done to an operatic score.  The entire image suggests Wertmuller's perverse opinion of her characters, and it certainly shows the possibilities of fervid imagination pitted it now seems clear after five features, against an all but non-existent sense of discrimination.</span></p> <p><span>On the face of it, Andrei Tarkovsky's <i>Solaris</i> promises a Russian version of Star Trek.  Russian physicist, Gibaryan, a psychologist and \"solarist\" to determine what has made over 80 scientists desert or die aboard the space-ship Solaris, a lab set up to study an oozing, brain-colored body of liquid on another planet.  Yet Gibaryan soon confronts the likelihood that the ocean Solaris may actually represent his own subconscious, and Tarkovsky appears to be attempting the same sort of space consciousness analogy Kubrick hinted at in <i>2001:  A Space Odyssey.</i> Maybe.</span></p> <p><span>For Tarkovsky flashes out his film with a bizarre, enigmatic, spirituality that ultimately defies hard and fast explanation.  The soulful-eyed women and dreamlike lapes of time the ocean draws from Gibaryan's mind and memory, along with a palet of dewy, pastel colors unfamiliar to Western films, vaguely suggest other film and other motifs, but leave the viewer for the most part unsure and even uneasy.</span></p> <p><span><i>The Man Who Fell to Earth.</i>  This man is hardly a <i>mensch,</i> that is when they show Bowie in the buff he doesn't even have a schlong!  Woo woo!  So that's why he came to America (penis envy.) Otherwise you wouldn't know.  The movie is beautifully filmed and sometimes stands on the verge of not only showing intelligent life but also being the most cleverly wrapped political package since <i>Chinatown.</i>  And then all of a sudden whap!--it's the dumbest one since <i>The Day the Earth Stood Still.</i>  An article in last Thursday's Times about the Rugoft theater chain in New York congratulated the owners for handing out a plot booklet explanation with the price of admision; I wish they'd thought of that at the Maplewood Theater.  If I had only known what the hell was going on in the last hour I wouldn't have had to ask:  Why does Buck Henry's hair turn white in the space of five minutes?  Why does Bowie's space shot fail?  Why do his records sell?  And yet, there is so much that is interesting in the film, so much canniness and so much good acting (including Bowie's) that at the risk of losing readership this early, we say go.</span></p> <p><span><i>The Passenger</i> is Antonioni at his most pretentious.  Jack Nicholson assumes the identity of an international gunrunner who dies in his hotel in the African bush and for a few scenes it appears that the film may develop into a compelling spy thriller.  But no such luck--Antonioni isn't really interested in guns--or anything else for that matter--so Nicholson simply wanders through Europe in an existential search for self-identity and the Meaning of Life, picking up a languid Maria Schneider en route.  Only the film's visual beauty--Spanish landscape and Gaudi architecture shot in lush Italian style--in any way redeems this tedious monstrosity.</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps the most politically sophisticated film to emerge from contemporary Cuba, <i>Memories of Underdevelopment</i> depicts the struggle of a young bourgeois intellectual to come to terms with the Cuban revolution.  Sympathetic to the dilemmas of his situation, the film nevertheless conveys a strong sense of the meaning of the revolution for the Cuban people and of the dramatic changes in social relations it has brought about.</span></p> <p><span><i>Union Maids</i> is the best radical documentary since <i>The Battle of Algiers.</i>  A study of three women CIO organizers in the '30s, the film intercuts contemporary material--newsreels and union songs--with interviews to produce a powerful portrait of these women as workers, as women, and as individuals.  Much of the newsreel material is unusual and exciting--footage of hunger marches and strikes in Chicago and Detroit, for example--but it is the interviews which are the truly remarkable aspect of the film.  These women, who were first interviewed by Staughton Lynd in <i>Rank and File,</i> are exceptionally articulate about their experiences, as well as able to bring contemporary political concerns, particularly feminism, to bear on the struggles of the '30s.  But what makes the film most effective and moving is the way these women are able to communicate their deep commitment to creating a more human and participatory society, a commitment as important to them and to us now as it was in the '30s.</span></p> <p><span><i>Idi Amin Dada,</i> It's difficult to imagine a film which could make Idi Amin look good, but this one does, if only by contrast to the director's superficial and racist approach.  Focussing almost entirely on Amin talking, the film portrays him as a fat African who speaks pidgin English, looks awfully funny in Western dress, and has delusions of grandeur.  What needs to be remembered while watching this inane spectacle is that the man is a mass murderer whose caprises are only slightly more barbaric than his policies, and that many atrocities were undoubtedly going on while Barbet Schroeder was following Amin around with a camera.</span></p> <p><span>This, as every other weekend, one is safe in going to the Harvard Epworth Church which without exception does the best, most comprehensive and most inspired film scheduling in the Boston area.  They bring in the classic and the esoteric landmarks in cinema and Thursdays and Sundays the best place to be in Cambridge is in one of their long pews.

{"title": "The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>If you're like most people, listening to a lot of contemporary music leaves you frustrated and guilty; frustrated that you don't get anything out of it, and guilty that you can't.  Well, a unique opportunity for expanding those cultural horizons will be on the Boston musical scene during October 24-30, as the International Society for Contemporary Music (ISCM) holds its annual World Music Festival at the New England Conservatory.  Through the efforts of composer and former NEC director Gunther Schuller, the festival, never before held in the United States, will involve 13 concerts of chamber and orchestral music by composers from 29 countries.</span></p> <p><span>The selection process for the World Festival Days is a blend of international politics and recognition of talent which transcends boundaries--each year the ISCM General Assembly chooses one member nation to present the annual festival.  (The United States, due to the dearth of government subsidies for the arts, has traditionally been at a disadvantage because of the lack of guaranteed funds.)  Then, the member nations select compositions from their countries and submit them to the international jury, which includes contemporary music luminaries Gunther Schuller, Elliott Carter, Jacques Guyonnet, David Drew, and Marlos Nobre.  A special effort was made this year to provide a broad cross-section of trends and countries; every member nation is represented by compositions except Iceland.  Most of the works have been composed within the past five years, and none dates further back than 1965.  The size and scope of the festival will be further enhanced by the expected appearance of approximately 100 'leading composers from Europe, Asia, and North and South America.  They will participate in discussions and workshops, and in many cases will be performing their own works.  In addition, an exhibition of 400 scores will be held at the New England Conservatory, and special demonstrations of the Electronic Music Laboratory at MIT are planned.</span></p> <p><span>Performers will include the Boston Symphony Orchestra under Seiji Ozawa, the New England Conservatory Orchestra under Gunther Schuller, the University of Iowa Orchestra under James Dixon, and an orchestra of Boston musicians under Richard Pittman.  Many chamber ensembles, including Boston Musica Viva, Collage, the Celveland String Quartet, the Pro Arte String Quartet, and the Societe de Musique contemporaine du Quebec, will also be appearing.  Most of the concerts will be in the Conservatory's venerable Jordan Hall, which should help with acclimatization to even the most unfamiliar sounds.</span></p> <p><span>The impact of the ISCM upon contemporary music since its 1923 inception in Vienna has been inestimable, both in encouraging works of virtually every major composer of this century and in bringing these works before an international audience.  The United States has rarely had a chance to sample such diversity and innovation in music at one specific locale and you might just feel a little better about contemporary music afterwards.</span></p> <p><span>ISCM, c/o New England Conservatory, 290 Huntington Ave., Boston; Telephone 262-0122 for further information.</span></p> <p><span><b>THURSDAY</b></span></p> <p><span>Busch Reisinger Museum--29 Kirkland St., Cambridge--noon--<i>James Johnson,</i> organ--program of Bach, Mozart, Marcello.

Orren, assistant professor of Government, in conjunction with The Washington Post, was designed to test the attitudes of the general American public and specifically those of leaders of eight distinct areas.</span></p> <p><span>The areas were business, politics, agriculture, women, blacks, youth, media and art and science.</span></p> <p><span>Verba said yesterday the joint project was the result of the interest he and Orren have in leadership and general attitudes in America, and the Post's desire to run a series of articles on national attitudes for the Bicentennial.</span></p> <p><span>One of the poll's more suprising findings is the extent to which feminist ideas have spread, Orren said yesterday.  The poll shows that America's youth and feminist leaders most strongly support feminist goals but that in general slightly more men than women support careers for women.</span></p> <p><span>In general, Americans support the ERA by a ratio of almost four to one.</span></p> <p><span>The poll results also show a fair amount of agreement among America's leadership--tested at both the national and regional level--on general principles, such as equality of opportunity and the basic fairness of the present income distribution in the United States.</span></p> <p><span>But the poll also indicates that American leaders, particularly in politics, look to a wide variety of solutions to problems they see in their society.</span></p> <p><span>Democratic activists are far to the left of most Democratic voters, while Republican party leaders are far to the right of their electorate, the poll shows.  Orren yesterday attributed Carter's primary victories to his centrist stance, and his increasingly liberal position to an effort on Carter's part to firm up his Democratic support.</span></p> <p><span>Similarly, Orren said, Ford has moved farther right since the primaries to strengthen his support in his party.</span></p> <p><span>But Democrats and Republicans who responded to the survey agreed that the two-party system suited this country, unlike the leaders of women, blacks and youths, who said they would like to see new political parties emerge.</span></p> <p><span>The surveyors chose seniors at ten widely-respected colleges as representative of youth in general.</span></p> <p><span>The poll suggests that the issue of civil rights, prominent during the '60s, has slipped out of public view:  the leaders of most groups ranked achieving equality for blacks low on a national priority list.</span></p> <p><span>Of the leadership groups surveyed, only representatives of the news media said they felt their group held too much power in society.  Most groups said they would like to see their views have more influence on decision-making.</span></p> <p><span>The Washington Post collected much of the data for the pool, compiling answers from about 2470 respondants.  The Post is publishing its conclusions in a series of five articles this week.</span></p> <p><span>Orren said he and Verba plan to analyze the results in greater detail in a book, paying particular attention to views of equality and to the degree to which leaders represent the groups they are supposed to exemplify.</span></p> <p><span>Orren said they would expand the groups of leaders surveyed to include labor leaders, a group they had tried without success to include in the Post poll.</span></p>"}

All these moves add up to Harvard's surplus.</span></p> <p><span>The University's budgetary problems have been a thorn in the side of Harvard financial planners for years.  Rising inflation and energy costs, which hit the Faculty of Arts and Sciences particularly hard, hurt all 42 separate budgets in the University and prevented many from bre king even.

{"title": "The U.S. and the Persian Gulf:  The Logic of Intervention | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><i>This is the first installment of the political page, a new feature of the Crimson.  The political page will contain long, analytical pieces on national, international and Harvard affairs and will appear as a second editorial page on occasional Thursday.</i></span></p> <p><span><i>The following article has been specially condensed for the Crimson by David Caploe from a piece he wrote with Eqbal Ahmad entitled \"The Logic of Intervention\" in the January issue of Race and Class, a quarterly organ of Third World Affairs published by the Institute of Race Relations (London) and the Transnational Institute (Amsterdam), on</i> The US and the Arab World.</span></p> <p><span><i>I.  The Advocates of Intervention in the Press</i></span></p> <p><span><b>S</b>INCE the autumn of 1974, Americans have been treated to spate of articles advocating US military intervention in the Middle East.  They have appeared in such influential Journals as <i>Harper's The New Leader, US News and World Report, New York Magazine,</i> the <i>Wall Street Journal,</i> and above all <i>Commentary,</i> the monthly organ of the American Jewish Committee.</span></p> <p><span>The last has particularly taken the lead in advancing the notion that the survival of Western Civilization is threatened by the recent insistence of the raw material producing countries in upsetting western capitalism's long-cherished rules of marketing and exchange, and that only force is likely to avert the otherwise inevitable decline of the West.</span></p> <p><span>According to those advancing this line of argument, the postwar global order, dominated by overwhelming US military and economic power, has been severely shaken by the Arab oil boycott and the OPEC price hikes which followed it.  More importantly, these events indicated a quest by the formerly colonized producing countries for equality, and this trend threatens the inequitable balance of power which the advocates of intervention view as being necessary to the survival of civilization.</span></p> <p><span><b>F</b>OR THE FIRST time, producer states demanded and received the price they wanted, instead of accepting the dictates of western companies backed up by the power of western states.  As such they are believed to have demonstrated that the global economic system created by imperialism could be used against the will and interests of its creators.  The advocates of US intervention in the Middle East emphasize this as the primary lesson of 1973, notwithstanding the fact that the petrodollars found their way back into the western economies (particularly America's), that the oil price hikes heightened the profits of corporations and that they gained as much if not more from the oil boycott than did the Arabs.</span></p> <p><span>The traditional Third World dependence on the West was perceived as being reversed, if admittedly only partially.  Until alternative energy sources are developed, the West will remain dependent on exported OPEC oil.  And even if alternative sources of energy can ever become economically competitive, the disappearance of cheap energy for the western economic machine throws into question the likelihood of maintaining a continual-growth economy.  In that case, with all the potential political and social dislocation it implies, the price of social peace in the metropolitan countries is likely to become a great deal higher.  For the West, at least, Johns Hopkins Professor of International Relations Robert Tucker's assessment in <i>Commentary</i> appears correct:  the OPEC revolt represents \"the latest manifestations of an egalitarianism which, if permitted to run its logical course, is likely to result first in chaos then in an international system far harsher than today's or even yesterday's system.\"</span></p> <p><span>Given the clear and present danger presented by the producer countries asserting their rights, what remedies are possible?  The interventionists question the validity of the economic plans for interlocking ties with the oil-producing countries favored by some Democratic party leaders in the US, by European governments and by some corporations with expanding interests in the region.  The primary objection of the \"hawks\" to such liberal advocacy of increasing the oil producer's interests in the global capitalist system is that it does not envisage reinforcing economic incentives with military muscle.  They argue that liberal economists make the fundamental mistake of assuming a world or rational men acting within the framwork of well-defined social and political assumptions.  In the situation created by the energy crisis such assumptions simply cannot be made.  When so much is at stake and the old assumptions about the international order no longer hold, \"the only feasible countervailing power to OPEC's control of oil power is power itself--military power,\" in the immortal wordes of \"Miles Ignotus\" (Latin for unknown soldier), described by <i>Harper's</i> as a \"Washington-based professor and defense consultant with intimate links to high-level US policy makers\" and rumored to be the pseudonym for Edward Luttwak, a well-known conservative \"defense\" intellectual close to Washinton's defense and \"intelligence community.\"</span></p> <p><span>HEY argue that a successful intervention will break the back of the Arab oil monopoly, slash oil prices and thereby put an end to the current depression ravaging the world economy.  Sactimonious protests aside, both the developed and Third World countries will accept this result with great--if covert--gratitude.  Because, argues Tucker,</span></p> <p><span>it defies belief that the developing nations, like the developed nations, would view with anything but relief, however disguised, a break in the petroleum price structure that followed a successful military intervention on the Persian Gulf...developed and underdeveloped would deplore the action--through in considerably varying degree--while accepting with alacrity the benefits flowin from it.</span></p> <p><span>US public opinion would likewise accept such a result.  Unlike Vietnam, where \"the American people instinctively felt that the national interest was not at stake\" (Miles Ignotus), the national gain here would be clear.  A surgically-neat military operation would avoid the quagmire syndrome which bogged down the US debacle in Indochina.  Thus the world will be saved from economic and political chaos, and US hegemony will be re-established, dissolving once and for all the bitter aftertaste of the defeat in Vietnam.</span></p> <p><span><i>II.  Military Planning for Intervention</i></span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE ABOVE are clearly not the spokesmen of the American military or political establishment, and one would normally dismiss their proposals as insignificant.  There are, however, compelling reasons to take them seriously.  Not only has the Pentagon been emphasizing preparations for intervention in the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean regions over the past few years, but the intervention option has been regularly invoked by the highest US officials in terms obviously aimed at legitimizing it.</span></p> <p><span>First-line combat outfits have been preparing for desert warfare for some time.  In the summer of 1973, there was public admission of at least a run-through for a desert style operation, nicknamed Operation Alkali Canyon 73, in <i>Time</i> and <i>US News and World Report.</i>  this was followed by Operation Petrolandia, involving the First Infantry and Fourth Cavalry Divisions as well as the First Air Force Squadron.  And unlike the limited press reports which had marked Alkali Canyon, Petrolandia was fully described in <i>Solider,</i> the journal of the US armed forces.  According to <i>USN&amp;WR</i> the \"Army's crack 82nd Airborne Division...spearhead of any such (Middle East) operation...regularly practices parachute drops over the desert around For Bliss, Texas, and annually trains for long distance operations with troop, drops in Greece, Turkey, and South Korea.\"</span></p> <p><span>The Navy has also been moving in the Persian Gulf area.  O November 25, 1974, the American aircraft carrier <i>Constellation</i> sailed into the Persian Gulf on what was officially described as a \"familiarization\" mission.  This journey marked a definite break with the Navy's 26-year-old convention of keeping warships out of the Gulf-proper.  <i>The Christian Science Monitor</i> noted that the voyage was designed, to show that Washington \"will not accept any threat to, or interruption of the supply of oil from Persian Gulf States.\"  Two weeks later, 2,000 Marines form the US Sixth Fleet landed in Sardinia in a mock invasion of Arab oil lands.  Vice-Admiral Turner told reporters:  \"We don't want to invade (the Middle East) but we are prepared.\"</span></p> <p><span>On January 19, 1975, the <i>Sunday Times</i> of <i>London</i> reported that the Pentagon had asked Sultan Qaboos bin Said of Oman--a trusted friend and ally of the British and the Shah of Iran--for full rights at the British air base on the Omani island of Masirah, a request subsequently granted.  For hundred miles south-east of the Straits of Hormuz, the entrance to the Gulf, Masirah sits right on the main sea lanes joining the Persian Gulf to the industrialized world--a perfect take off and refueling point only.  Despite Congressional strictures against it the US has continued to construct a base on the strategically located Indian Ocean British island of Diego Garcia.</span></p> <p><span><i>III.  Administration Endorsement of Intervention</i></span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>N A DIFFERENT front and even more ominously, the intervention arguments have been invested with legitimacy by statements of the highest officials in the government:  President Gerald Ford, Secretary of State Henry Kissenger, and former Defense Secretary James Schlesinger.</span></p> <p><span>Ford began the process by noting in a speech in September, 1974 that \"throughout history nations have gone to war over natural resources\"--a hint quickly perceived by the Arab states as a thinly-veiled threat to intervene in case of another boycott of substantial price increase.  The same day, Kissinger sounded the same theme in tones later described to newsmen as \"Doomsday language.\"</span></p> <p><span>In early January 1975, Kissinger stated in an interview in <i>Business Week</i> that the US \"would consider using military force in the Middle East under circumstances of grave emergency--if say, the industrialized world became threatened with economic strangulation.\"  <i>US News and World Report</i> later noted that \"to make clear that this (Kissinger) statement was neither accidental nor casual but rather a deliberate declaration of American policy, the State Department distributed the interview in advance under its own imprimatur.  And the white House subsequently announced that Mr. Kissinger was reflecting the views of Mr. Ford.\"</span></p> <p><span>In May 1975, Schlesinger this time took the lead, warning that \"America would be 'less tolerant' of a new oil embargo and is reserving military force as one possible response,\" according to <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> of May 20, 1975.  The Arab states once again protested and the by-now usual disclaimers were issued--this time by Ford and Kissinger, the proponents of intervention in the first place.</span></p> <p><span>But by this time, the world-bending denials were largely ignored, and the pros and cons of intervention were being openly discussed, by large portions of the American press and public, as technical problems of a legitimate and rational option of US foreign policy.</span></p> <p><span><i>IV.  Intervention and the Logic of U.S. Foreign Policy.</i></span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HERE ARE thus compelling reasons to believe that an American intervention in the Middle East is possible and is treated by Washington as a serious option.  In fact, there are deep compulsions within the basic structure of US foreign policy would could lead to a Persian Gulf intervention, especially since US policy-makers view the main threats to their hegemony as converging in the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean regions.  They perceive Russian influence as expanding in the region from Mozambique and Angola to Somalia and Iraq.  Similarly, the growth of independent economic ties between western Europe and the region which holds the World's largest reserves of mineral and energy resources is regarded with apprehension in Washington.  Finally, here more than South Asia, West Africa or Latin America, the national liberation movements are seen as making progress and winning victories--from Angola and Eritea to Oman and Palestine.</span></p> <p><span>If the US contained the expanding Russian influence in that region then the USSR would remain second to the US in a basically bipolar balance of power.  If Washington could ensure its paramountcy in the region, control the access to its raw materials and be the watchman of its waterways, then it would have maintained a powerful leverage over western Europe and Japan.  The \"stability\" of the international order depends on the containment of the liberation movements and the preservation of pro-US regimes in this strategic area more than in any other.  Finally, a successful Persian Gulf intervention appears as the master-stroke that can reconstitute the Vietnam-torn fabric of the bipartisan domestic consensus on foreign policy.</span></p> <p><span>Thus a development which is officially perceived as being decisively unfavorable of US interests may produce a military intervention; and the prospects of such a development occurring are fair.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE APPARENT failure of the Kissinger diplomatic offensive in the Middle East will certainly renew and probably enhance Russia's eclipsed role in the region.  The leftist forces may also emerge stronger from the debacle, especially if the radical Arab groups can discredit Sadat's and Saudi Arabia's policy while avoiding the appearance of being responsible for its failure.  When confronted with such developments.  US officials may be attracted to the intervention option as a way of recouping militarily diplomatic and political losses.</span></p> <p><span>Since the Middle East belongs in the an-tagonistic half of detente, a successful intervention would present the Soviets with a <i>fait accompli</i> difficult to undo or even challenge without bringing the world to the brink of nuclear war.  Politically, Russian credibility would take a severe beating.  Not only would Russian allies, Syria and Iraq, be sandwiched by the Israelis on one side and the Americans on the other, but the value of a Russian connection would be thrown into doubt throughout the region.  According to this view, a decisive show of force in the Gulf would go a long way towards undercutting Soviet prestige, and thus keep the Soviet prestige, and thus keep the Soviet penetration into the Middle East tentative and unsure.</span></p> <p><span>An intervention would also give the US the power to regulate the pricing and marketing of oil to its restive allies.  And while this crude threat is not to be overestimated--after all, it is not very likely that the US will threaten to turn off the taps to Japan, or even France--the point would be underlined that American leadership of the capitalist world cannot be questioned without serious hardship for the questioner.  Implicit though it may remain, the message would be impossible to misread.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>O A military establishment anxious to restore its credibility after its astounding failure in Indo-China, a Persian Gulf intervention would appear to offer a unique opportunity to redeem past failures by satisfying the compulsion to find and fight a conventional enemy according to conventional ground rules.</span></p> <p><span>Furthermore, in the arid desert terrain of Arabia all the <i>military</i>  excuses for the Vietnam disaster are missing:  there is no jungle for the enemy to hide in; no demographic sea for the \"guerilla\" fish to swim in; and no safe sanctuaries protected from destruction by fear of world opinion.  Instead of a long, protracted war fought for no clear reason, the planning here calls for a quick, surgical operation with minimal loss of American life against a popularly-understood threat to the \"American way of life\"--a swift and decisive move which will unite the nation, rather than divide it with unending shame and recrimination.</span></p> <p><span>For the task of constructing a new domestic concensus on foreign policy in place of the Vietnam-shattered doctrine of limited wars, a Persian Gulf may appear as a vital tool.  The restoration of that consensus necessitates what Kissinger has aptly termed a \"legitimizing principle of social repression\":  an ideological justification which would ensure the support of the American people and Congress for an aggressive policy abroad.  The language of <i>realpolitik</i> offers a poor basis for popular support for a corporate ideology.  Hence, modern myths have been a mixture of destiny and demonology:  the British \"white man's burden\" and the French <i>\"Mission Civilizatrice,\"</i> for example.</span></p> <p><span>The Vietnam war put an end to the simple, powerful imperatives of the cold war.  Detente accelerated the end of the old consensus.  By juxtaposing enmity and alliance, confrontation and camaraderie, diplomatic sell-outs and revolutionary solidarity, the policy of detente ended the certainties which had defined the cold war consensus in the US.  Hence a new mission and a new demon have to be invented as a substitute for the old.  Intervention may be a part of the process.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE demon, of course, is the fat, rapacious Arab sheikh whose grosslyextravagant pleasures are financed by the hard-earned money of the western people.  Miles Ignotus is quite explicit in this respect, including not only the Arabs, but other Third World peoples as well:  \"military dictators and megalomaniacal kings of OPEC,\"  \"narrow self-appointed ruling groups (elections have become a rarity in Asia and Africa) fond of shiny black cars and numbered Swiss accounts,\" not to mention the by-now infamous \"OPEC extortionists\" and \"Arab blackmailers.\"</span></p> <p><span>The imagery of these rich greasy Arabs (oil is of their very essence) with voracious sexual and sensual appetites, indulged at the expense of the sweat and toil of others, is calculated to set off a series of racist associations, all of which point to one conclusion:  the threat posed to western civilization by the profligates of OPEC.</span></p> <p><span>With this new demonology is born a new American mission:  the saving of western civilization from the clutches of the sheikhs through the forcible destruction of OPEC.  The whole question of a military intervention in the Persian Gulf thus moves from the mundane level of politics to the metaphysical level of national salvation.  A US intervention is transformed from a desperate act of a declining imperial power into a courageous and disinterested gesture by the American people, undertaken in order to save the West and all it stands for from its otherwise imminent demise at the hands of the \"extortionists\" and \"blackmailers.\"</span></p> <p><span><i>David Caploe '73, a former Crimson editor, is working on a book on ideology and strategy in Israel.

For the day, the Cardinals out-fouled the visitors, 16-5.</span></p> <p><span>The Cardinals got their initial goal in the first 10 minutes of play.  While Harvard's defenders tried sleepwalking instead of soccer, a free kick sailed downfield to a wide-open forward who punched the ball home for a 1-0 Wesleyan lead.</span></p> <p><span><b>Folly Floater</b></span></p> <p><span>Later in the first half, the speedy Cardinal right wing streaked past Crimson left wing Bob Carey and cut to the inside.  He barely managed to get a foot on a long crossfield feed, launching a folly floater toward the Harvard goal.</span></p> <p><span>\"The kick looked endless,\" Harvard coach George Ford said last night.  \"It seemed the ball would never get to the net.\"  Unfortunately, it did, just ahead of the diving Crimson goalie, Fred Herold.  Ahead 2-0, Wesleyan had all the goals it would need.</span></p> <p><span>For the Harvard defense, those were the only two miscues of the day.  Ford was left very satisfied with their effort, maintaining that after three games the inner guard has been the strength of the squad.  \"The defense played very well,\" he commented last night.  \"Unfortunately, they just got caught those two times.\"</span></p> <p><span>In the second half, Harvard was a different team.  \"They showed me something today that I haven't seen in my three years here at Harvard--tremendous desire,\" Ford explained afterwards.  \"We used the whole bench and every single player just wanted it so bad.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>Gentle Bens</b></span></p> <p><span>Men known for their gentle dispositions were apparently driven to a frenzy.  Matt Bowyer, one of the quietest players on the team, reacted to what he considered to be an undetected foul by pushing back.  The officials saw that push, and the Crimson midfielder was ejected from the game.</span></p> <p><span>Shortly thereafter, Lee Nelson got tangled up with an opponent, broke free with the ball, and fed it downfield to Harvard's big gun, co-captain Lyman Bullard.  An official broke up the play, calling the ball back for a Crimson free kick.  The official thought even less of Nelson's comments than he thought of the play, and sent the Crimson booter off the field to join Bowyer in exile.</span></p> <p><span>This new-found combativeness made itself felt in the flow of play too, and Harvard took command of the game.  But the time kept clicking away, and the frustration continued to mount, as the Crimson failed to cash in on its opportunities.</span></p> <p><span><b>Net Solution</b></span></p> <p><span>Finally, with only five minutes left to play, Bob Grant solved the Cardinal netminder and pulled the visitors within one.  \"That goal just had to come,\" Ford said later.  \"There was simply no end to the offensive pressure.\"</span></p> <p><span>Still leading by one, Wesleyan was content to kick the ball upfield and waste time.  Struggling to keep the ball in the offensive end, Harvard nevertheless had its chances to knot the score.

{"title": "Divining China's Future | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Few people out-and-out believe in prophecy.  Lucky guesses happen along now and then, and mathematicians thrive on the so-called educated guess.  But a person bluff enough to crane his neck toward the future and expound on the view over yonder is all too often blushing from more than exertion by the time the scene has gotten plain enough for everyone to see. Still, if you can trace an edge here and there, catch a glint on the horizon, and toss in a grain of folk wisdom--say, about history repeating itself--divination is an awfully tempting pasttime.  Politicians like to do it; journalists, too; scholars, as befits their trade, tend to be more circumspect.</span></p> <p><span>These days the People's Republic of China is a very popular thing to watch.  Yet even with Chairman Mao Tse-tung, a master of enigma, gone, not much is clearly perceptible.</span></p> <p><span>Foreign analysts have left a trail of miscalculations behind them in attempts to gauge shifts in Chinese policy and leadership since the rise of the People's Republic in 1949.  For example, less than a year ago many Westerners had slated Deputy Prime Minister Teng Hsiao-ping for a position flanking Mao's.  Since then, Teng has been denounced as part of a \"right deviationist wing (conspiring) to reverse correct verdicts\" or, as the American press loosely put the charge, as a pragmatist.  Meanwhile, a relative unknown, Hua Kuo-feng, has glided past Teng to become the highest-ranking official in the country, holding both the prime ministry and the vice-chairmanship of the communist party.</span></p> <p><span>Of course, gauzy stories redolent of power struggles accompanied this reversal:  you can still pore them out of newspapers.  While the accounts may come across rather authoritatively in print, they are also apt to be vague, and scratching around in reference books often provides no historical clues to these struggles.  Instead of offering a sturdy explanation, the journalists unendingly dissect the latest round of titular shuffling (the latest on Teng is still going strong after six months) until someone composes a new variation on the theme of personality clashes and shifts within the hierarchy.  Personality and power, after all, make good copy.</span></p> <p><span>But wagers on personality types and power quotients do not necessarily explain Chinese politics or society, or the way a system works in any country, for that matter.  That much is agreed upon by Harvard's most prominent and widely-quoted Sinologists--John K. Fairbank '29, Higginson Professor of History, Benjamin I. Schwartz '38, Williams Professor of History, Roy M. Hofheinz Jr. '67, professor of Government, and Ross Terrill, assistant professor of Government.  In a typical response to a query about the post-Mao direction of Chinese leadership, Fairbank says, \"It's just nonsense to try to guess at history from a great distance.  The American press likes to do it a lot.  Yet I doubt there is any way the American public can understand Chinese history; they don't study it in school.\"</span></p> <p><span>Since Mao's death, the American press has limited its discussion of Chinese politics to a couple of contending factions, dubbed \"radicals\" and \"moderates.\"  The radicals are said to be largely the ideological followers and offspring of Mao, including his widow, Chiang Ching, who is usually described as an uppity and outspoken woman, while the less inscrutable moderates are made out to be relatively uninterested in ideological purity when economic efficiency is at stake; one moderate name that seems bandied about is Chen Hsi-lin, commander of the Peking military region.  Hua Kuo-feng has managed to elude being tied into either parcel so far, and the press seems to have settled for a draw, granting him the position of issue straddler and compromiser:  Fox Butterfield of The New York Times suggests Hua can be counted \"a good representative of a second generation of Chinese leader, a post-Maoist man.\"</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps sensing the meaninglessness of the terms \"radical\" and \"moderate,\" the press has devised surrogates that hone in on the concept of the dialectic of Chinese politics; when you're in this supposedly more authentic frame of mind, you talk about idealists and pragmatists, respectively.  Even this pair of labels, which look to convey the unfriendly notions of revolutionary fervor and steady common sense, derive significance from the writer's cultural attitudes and experiences.  Here the terms are being applied to a complex, fairly inaccessible society by Americans, and Thomas B. Gold, a fourth-year graduate student in Sociology, points out that the transfer may be too glib.  Gold, who visited the People's Republic a year ago, says, \"You go to China and you see it in action, and you cannot understand what they're doing there in our terms.  What we mean by pragmatic and what they mean are two different things.\"  Such simple labels promote misunderstanding of the country's social and economic goals, he adds.  \"There is no question Mao's line wants economic development,\" Gold says.  But this growth should not be forced \"by relying on machines alone.\"  Instead it should be accomodated to the people through \"'walking on two legs,' relying on modern and indigenous methods.\"</span></p> <p><span>Government professor Hofheinz echoes Gold's dissatisfaction with the ability of open-ended labels to get to the crux of Chinese politics.  The analogies the widely used factional terms conjure up, he says, \"are quite inaccurate.  In fact, political factions are not oriented around issues of moderate versus radical, but guns versus rice, central versus local control, equality of education versus political control over it--real live issues about which we know nothing in terms of alignment, or know only by implication.\"</span></p> <p><span>Hofheinz does not expect jockeying for positions within the leadership to become particularly intense in the near future, though he concedes that such maneuverings have long been obscured by the aura of mystery maintained by the Chinese.  \"China cannot afford internal turmoil--tendencies toward unity will be much tighter than most Western reporters anticipate--but there will be confusion.  That is, there is a possibility of general paralysis, with very deleterious effects, especially economic.\"  Hofheinz believes polarization along the radical-moderate lines could occur only outside the leadership that the foreign press is so fascinated with.  \"There is an outside possibility,\" he says, that \"someone will call for and try to drum up support in external circles--that is, outside of the few dozen people who govern China.\"</span></p> <p><span>The conflict over the issues Hofheinz focuses on--guns versus rice, central versus local control, equality of education versus political control over it--grew most extreme during the Great Leap Forward of 1958-59 and the Cultural Revolution of the '60s.  These startlingly unstable campaigns delineate a unique element in Mao's leadership.  Convinced that China would progress only if the principles of revolution remained vital, he encouraged the Chinese people's awareness of the perpetual struggle between two poles--the revolutionary line and the \"capitalist road\" or \"revisionism.\"  Mao's teachings acted as a fulcrum on which these lines would weigh, teeter a bit, and finally reach a temporary equilibrium.  In the process individuals and institutions risked annihilation, including the chairman himself.  As the programs of the Great Leap and the Cultural Revolution (\"Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of though contend.\") nearly edged out of control, Mao's position twice became precarious.  He later recalled that at these times he was not viewed as a contributor or regulator of the government's daily routine.  Thus, Mao said, he was dispensable.</span></p> <p><span>A far cry from the U.S. two-party system of Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter--two men of relatively similar outlooks--this questioning process is basic to China, an initial step toward grasping China on its own terms.  Grad student Gold chooses the phrase \"uninterrupted\" revolution to describe the process's constant resolution through change.  Gold believes the label \"permanent\" revolution smacks too much of anarchy or unending chaos.</span></p> <p><span>Indeed, Schwartz and Terrill agree that Mao carefully managed the \"uninterrupted\" revolution after the Cultural Revolution produced a second serious threat to his position.  This suggests a principal question left in the wake of Mao's death:  If, as Schwartz says, the revolution can be turned off by Mao, its creator, then what will happen to the revolution now?</span></p> <p><span>Terrill, for one, sees a growth of public opinion in China that may not be amenable to Mao's legacy.  \"Among a majority there's a great deal of consumerism.  Among a minority there's idealism and an attempt to renew Chinese socialism.  Consumeristic instincts go against the efforts of the radicals to whip up revolution.\"  While he grants that the Chinese leadership could take either direction in the long run, like other Harvard China-watchers, he insists it would be useless to try to gauge policy shifts so early.</span></p> <p><span>While China's political climate may be uncertain, Terrill says, the country remains stable socially and is ripe for sociological study.  Ideology may no longer provide the vital clue to understanding China.  \"It's the political system at the national level that is less stable.  But the family system, the communes in the countryside, the state-owned factories in the cities really run without much ideology, so Mao's thought will become an <i>overarching</i> ethic.  The key to the stability of the commune and the factory level is organizational brilliance rather than Mao's thought.\"  Chinese communism, Terrill explains, functions more as a \"social morality\" while German Marxism serves as a \"social science.\"</span></p> <p><span>As for the continued life of the revolution, Terrill believes, \"you can't sustain a revolution forever--that's the internal logic and the sociology of it.\"  Revolution happens, he says, when people feel an intolerable injustice, but it is not required in the push for perfectability.  Terrill does allow for the possibility that the Chinese will grow apathetic, making it easier for a rigid bureaucracy to take root--\"the old combination of legalism from above and Taoism from below.\"</span></p> <p><span>From Terrill's point of view, the revolution has definitely been accomplished and Mao is no longer essential, so any attempt at replacement would be superfluous.  \"They do not need nor would they tolerate an individual with the bold originality of Mao.\"  Terrill singles out ideology as the dynamic aspect of Mao's rule, rather than charisma, and when you're dealing with such a factor, an individual just isn't crucial.</span></p> <p><span>Schwartz hews to a sharply different analysis of Mao's role.  In his opinion, Mao the man has steadily merged with Maoist ideology, especially in the past few years.  Even if he was ill and relatively inactive towards the end of his life, Schwartz says Mao's presence was influential.  \"I don't think he was ever a leader interested in the details or mechanics of government.  Yet all he had to do was say something and it would come down with a crash, he says.  Schwartz foresees some hardship in establishing the Chinese Communist Party as an institutional entity, a central focus, with the find of legitimacy that its chairman had.  And although he sees factions in the leadership compromising now, because of anxiety over splintering within the government, Schwartz feels the party still must assert itself as an independent entity.</span></p> <p><span>Foreign analysts have been intrigued by the selection of Mao's successor almost since the Republic's founding, and many who seemed primed for the position--like Teng Hsiaoping--have abruptly fallen by the wayside.  Hofheinz thinks Mao was also highly concerned with succession in his last year. Nonetheless, he says, Mao tried to undermine any institutionalized process of succession.  He stood out above everyone else and tended to create anonymity at the level below him.  Hofheinz hazards that \"there are those who will try to preserve this anonymity using collective leadership in the name of Chairman Mao to justify their position, which will create a very unstable situation.\"  Another plausible scenario, he says, is that individuals tied to Mao \"will try to ride out the wave of his popularity--his wife would be an obvious beneficiary.\"</span></p> <p><span>Hofheinz shares Schwartz's impression that the country has become accustomed to Mao's \"spirit\" or \"guidance\" and he posits that the society will depend on something akin to this \"guiding light\" to continue functioning as it has been.  This doesn't mean all-out struggles must continue, Hofheinz says:  \"The spiritual factor doesn't have to do-with politics; it's a psychological factor.\"  He believes that worries over China's precarious economic situation will impose a temporary lull on spiritual exhortation. But even in the later ranges of history he says, \"swings will probably not be so violent as they were when Mao was at the helm.  We're going to have many hands at the tiller now; so turns will take longer to develop, will be more obviously done, and they will be telegraphed in advance.\"</span></p> <p><span>The general consensus among Harvard's Sinologists is that China is moving into a period of continued experimentation.  There won't be any new quotations from Mao Tse-tung to tide the country over rough patches, and those now wielding the well-worn aphorisms of the past may imbue them with distorted meanings.  The most curious response to Mao's death may come from China's younger generation, which has never known another leader or system or experienced the turmoil and deprivation endured by Chinese in the era of imperialism and during the socialist revolutions--the same generation that, in other nations, has often stood in awe of Mao Tse-tung.</span></p> <p><span><b>'One spark can set fire to the whole plain.'</b> <b>--Calligraphy by Mao Tse-tung.</b></span></p>"}
{"title": "Kissinger in Southern Africa | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>U</b>NTIL THE ANGOLAN WAR of 1975, Southern Africa had a limited place in the strategic thinking of Secretary of State Henry Kissinger '50.  His policy for the region, formulated in 1969, envisaged complete maintenance of the status quo for the white minority regimes, including the Portuguese colonies.  But the Portuguese revolution of 1974, and more importantly for cold warrior Kissinger, the successful use of Cuban troops and Soviet arms against American and South African intervention in the Angolan civil war, have forced him to adapt his strategy to the changing realities of Southern Africa.  It is in this context that Kissinger's current diplomatic initiative in Rhodesia must be understood.</span></p> <p><span>The key to Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith's capitulation on transition to majority rule within two years was South African pressure.  South African Prime Minister John Vorster appears to have threatened that if Smith did not accept majority rule he would end fuel and water supplies to Rhodesia, as well as cutting its rail links to the outside world, thus bringing the Rhodesian economy to its kness immediately.  Vorster's aims are quite straightforward:  he hopes to consolidate apartheid at home by sacrificing Rhodesia and so defusing violent conflict on his borders.  At the same time, his policies are designed to change world opinion about South Africa and to revive his attempts at detente with black leaders.</span></p> <p><span>While Kissinger and the Ford administration have no commitment to apartheid <i>per se,</i> their vision of America's strategic and economic interests in the region aligns them with South Africa. Kissinger's basic strategy has not changed since 1969:  he has not suddenly become more concerned with human rights nor has he come to consider black nationalist regimes as better allies than the military and economic might of South Africa.  What has changed is his estimation of the possibilities of non-revolutionary change in those areas of Southern Africa outside South Africa itself.  Kissinger recognizes that the new strength of the forces pushing for change in Southern Africa, as well as superpower competition, means that a less intransigent approach to the dismantling of white minority regimes is necessary if a radical shift in the balance of forces in the region is to be avoided.</span></p> <p><span>As a result, Kissinger's strategy in the short and medium term is extremely similar to Vorster's.  The aims of the current diplomatic initiative are to prevent violent conflicts which could bring into being radical regimes militarily hostile to South Africa on its borders and to legitimatize South Africa in the eyes of the world.  By having Vorster play an apparently reasonable role in dismantling white minority rule in Rhodesia Kissinger may be laying the groundwork for eventual cosmetic reforms in South Africa itself.</span></p> <p><span>Given the basic aims of the negotiators, it is not surprising that the actual peace plan contains many ambiguities which leave room for undermining the future of majority rule in Rhodesia.</span></p> <p><span>The nature of the interim government.  The provisions in the settlement for white veto power and control of the army and security forces of the transitional government will seriously undermine the ability to produce effective majority rule.  Majority rule can mean many different things in practice--Smith has not yet accepted the principle of one man, one vote, for example--and a government with a white veto power and white monopoly of legal coercive force could easily produce a constitution which is not truly democratic though it is nominally committed to majority rule.</span></p> <p><span>Investment guarantees and the International Development Fund.  These are designed to encourage white Rhodesians to stay and to prevent any major transfer of wealth from whites to blacks.  Smith explicitly said that he rejected any plan \"to buy white Rhodesians out.\"  What could result from this provision is a situation in which Rhodesia formally becomes a majority rule state but where the bulk of its wealth and effective power remain concentrated in the hands of a white minority.  It is unconscionable that wealth and power accumulated under explicitly racist and exploitative conditions should be allowed to control the country's future development.  Similarly, there is a danger that the development fund provisions of the settlement will be used to preclude any experimentation with non-Western models of development in Rhodesia.</span></p> <p><span>Cessation of guerrilla activity.  Given Smith's past record as a negotiator, the black leaders are undoubtedly reluctant to end guerrilla war and international economic sanctions before the installation of an acceptable majority rule government.  Otherwise there will be no effective pressures to force Smith to comply with the agreement.  The anti-guerrilla provisions of the agreement also imply that those forces which desire radical social change within Rhodesia itself--and which are largely responsible for making these negotiations necessary--are essentially to be shut out of the political process.  This will of course be unacceptable to the guerrillas themselves and is probably one of the front-line black presidents' major objections to the settlement, particularly on the part of Machel of Mozambique and Neto of Angola.  Finally, the anti-guerrilla provisions take advantage of the major black weakness in this situation:  intense disunity among the various factions of the liberation movement.  Smith may be hoping that these divisions will make it impossible for the blacks to present a united front in constitutional negotiations, and thus allow him to retain effective power after transition to nominal majority rule against a fragmented opposition.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HESE AMBIGUITIES in the Rhodesian settlement are sufficient to require a quite different sort of agreement, and the front-line African presidents are right to have rejected this one.  They do not appear, however, to have rejected the principle of negotiation with American involvement.  This is also politically intelligent--Black Africans have nothing to gain from a bloody and protracted guerrilla war nor from the dependence on Soviet aid such a war would require.</span></p> <p><span>The front-line presidents recognize that Kissinger is willing to sacrifice the marginal Rhodesia for the sake of consolidating the much more critical position of South Africa.  But they also realize that it is possible at this point to gain a great deal for blacks in Rhodesia and Namibia by negotiation, while the situation within South Africa is considerably less hopeful for the moment.  And despite the conservative expectations of Kissinger and Vorster's strategy, the dismantling of white minority regimes on its borders cannot help but encourage renewed struggle on the part of those on whom the overthrow of apartheid must ultimately depend--the blacks and coloreds of South Africa, who have already shown tremendous courage in resisting the humiliations of a brutal and racist police state.</span></p>"}
{"title": "A Time For Reconciliation | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>HE RESIGNATION of Daniel Patrick Moynihan as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations is welcome news to all those who wish to see non-antagonistic relations between the United States and the third world.  As an American spokesman, Moynihan has loudly proclaimed a policy of total contempt for most Asian, African and Latin American nations and their leaders.</span></p> <p><span>In his eight-month tenure at the U.N., Moynihan attempted through public pronouncements to reestablish the justifications for U.S. world hegemony in the face of the \"humiliations\" of Vietnam.  Moynihan presents himself as the defender of an imperiled Western civilization and increasingly threatened individual human rights.  Time and again, he has pointed to what he believes is the gradual swallowing up, since World War II, of liberal democratic regimes in a sea of totalitarian states welling up from the third world.  He expressed his vision most starkly in a speech last October in San Francisco:  \"It is sensed in the world that democracy is in trouble.  There is blood in the water and the sharks grow frenzied.\"</span></p> <p><span>But behind Moynihan's fears of the \"idea of the all-encompassing State\" lies his desire to convince Americans that the aims of our foreign policy are not the defense of a world-wide system of U.S. military and economic domination.  In the recent past, the U.S. has attempted to bomb Indochinese anticolonialists into submission and has continuously supported and invested in overtly totalitarian regimes like Chile, South Korea, and Iran, where torture, censorship and political repression are the everyday instruments of government.  Now, as popular consciousness is increasingly sensitive to the gap between American rhetoric and reality, Moynihan's efforts to create a new demonology are of crucial importance in restoring domestic support for a revived counterrevolutionary foreign policy.</span></p> <p><span><b>E</b>VEN WHEN Moynihan's attacks are directed against a clearly evil target, like Uganda's Idi Amin, they are couched in language calculated to offend third world sensibilities.  It was a gross distortion to claim, as Moynihan did, that it was \"no accident\" that \"racist murderer\" Idi Amin, Ugandan head-of-state, was president of the Organization for African Unity.  Most African leaders deplore Amin and his policies, although they accepted him as formal head of the OAU--owing to the organization's yearly rotation system--to avoid a public rift.</span></p> <p><span>Again, when Moynihan attacked the reprehensible U.N. resolution terming Zionism a form of racism, his polemic was not directed at the consequences of the resolution for the continued existence of Israel, but the threat the resolution posed for the survival of \"Western democratic principles.\"  To read the actual text of his general assembly speech, one might think that Ben-Gurion, Rabin and Meir were less under attack by the resolution than Locke, Hobbes and Rousseau.</span></p> <p><span>Moynihan has claimed that \"the United Nations is a place where lies are told.\"  But in his charge that the real issue in Angola is the threat of Soviet domination in Southern Africa, Moynihan himself is party to a bold enough lie.  Not only is the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola avowedly opposed to Soviet bases on their territory, but massive Soviet involvement there came only in response to prior American intervention to prevent leftist victory.</span></p> <p><span>Moynihan has proposed that the United States withhold foreign aid, including humanitarian and development assistance, from those third world countries who do not support the American position on the Zionism resolution and Angola.  Not only is the use of U.S. foreign aid as a political weapon certain to hurt independent leftist third world regimes but such usage would be irrational even on its own terms, because it could only be used against those countries too weak to protect themselves, whether or not they are the chief opponents of American policy.  It may be assumed that wealthy or strategically important Arab states will continue to enjoy American patronage, regardless of their votes at the U.N.</span></p> <p><span>Of course the purpose of the threatened aid cut-offs, like the rest of Moynihan's gestures, has little to do with American foreign policy--these rhetorical proposals will almost certainly never be implemented.  The proposals are really designed for domestic consumption, to advance the image of an America standing up for her national pride and democratic heritage, defending her self-image with force if necessary, as in the <i>Mayaguez</i> incident.  This policy is identical in substance with that of Ford and Kissinger; Moynihan was merely indiscreet enough to say publicly what the exigencies of detente forbid the administration from expressing.  Moynihan was sacrificed symbolically, but conservative Americans need not fear:  the policy he supports will survive until Americans recognize the need for reconciliation with the vast majority of the world's people.</span></p>"}
{"title": "The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Something should be said early on, in this newly-revived column of press clips, about the dean of press clips himself, Dr. Press Clips, the successor to Hunter S. Thompson for our favorite cult journalist.  We refer, of course, to Alexander Cockburn--pronounced <b>Coe</b>burn.  For our money (and this is one of his favorite phrases), he is the best around.  His weekly columns in The Village Voice have an obsessive quality, achieving for the mid-seventies what Dr. Thompson did for the violence and insanity of the Nixon years.  Nixon's debacle finished Thompson--it was a final irony for the president to drag along with him, when he retired to EI Cass Pacifica, the man who understood him best.  So Thompson is holedup in Boulder Creek, listening to tapes of Jimmy Carter speeches and reading about himself in Doonesbury.  Thompson was best in writing about thugs and goons, from San Bernadino's Hell's Angels and the burnt-out geeks of Las Vegas, to the inhabitants of the Oval Office.  Covering Saigon at the time of NLF victory, when Nixon was gone, Thompson seemed trivial, almost offensive.  At the same time the presidential tapes were revealing that H.E. and P. even <b>talked</b> like Thompson (\"Take Pat Gray out and shoot him (laughter)\"; \"Fuck the lira, there's no votes in that\").  But his day was done.</span></p> <p><span>Ah, but we're wandering.  At first glance, it's difficult to see how someone of Cockburn's credentials could be the logical successor to a maniac like Thompson.  His fatner was Claud Cockburn, the British Communist journalist of the 1930's, and Cockburn himself started out on the editorial board of New Left Review, the kind of magazine which was the first to publish Althusser's \"Contradiction and Over-determination\" in English.  But when confronted with American popular culture, he went wild.  On a serious level, Cockburn is in the forefront of a group of leftist journalists writing in a wide variety of popular publications (from (MORE) to Parade Magazine) about what might be called \"power in America\".  Along with writers like Andrew Kopkind, Emma Rothschild, Kirkpatrick Sale and James Ridgeway, he seeks to cover politics in the broad sense, evading Washingtonitis and other diseases afflicting mainstream pundits, the Krafts and Restons of the world.</span></p> <p><span>Kraft and Reston, in fact, are two of Cockburn's pet peeves.  He may have started by seriously criticizing these men--and he still does--but now, in the best gonzo tradition, they have <b>gotten</b> to him.  He is positively obsessed with them, and also with Jerry Brown (whom he feels represents a new fascist politics of scarcity), and Jimmy Carter (totally bogus), and C.L. Sulzberger, the major foreign policy voice for Cockburn's \"Center Right Coalition,\" an auspicious group including the likes of Daniel P. Moynihan, Marty Peretz, and half the Harvard faculty.</span></p> <p><span>Anyway, Cockburn is suited to these times because he understands what Hannah Arendt called \"the banality of evil.\"  The wild-eyed potential generalissimos of Thompson's day have given way to the faceless bureaucrats, unknown corporate executives and \"liberal\" intellectuals who really make the rules.  His weekly columns written with Ridgeway--an Institute for PolicyStudiesradical--under the heading of Surplus Value (economic issues) and The Greasy Pole (presidential politics), are generally thoughtful and serious pieces.  Cockburn saves his true Private Eye spirit for the Press Clips.  Also featured are \"Dear Dr. Pressclips; Helpful Hints for Harried Hacks\" (where Marshall Frady was advised that his case of \"penny a word\" was terminal.)</span></p> <p><span>All in all, despite the awarding of prizes like the C.L. Sulzberger Memorial Plate and the Franco-Quinlan Memorial Tent, Cockburn is a serious and orthodox journalist.  Unlike Thompson, he uses sources and formal interviews--he has credibility.  Not only is he the best media critic in the country, he is seriously committed to social change, and is an important critic of society as well.  His articles on the business community fill a gap that has been the greatest flaw in American journalism for year.  But all with a light touch--when he tells us that California oil and banking interests have traded in Ford for Reagan, and gives convincing evidence for his claim, he titles his revelation \"Bozo Must Go.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "End Covert CIA Operations...Democratize Policy-Making | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>HE FORD ADMINISTRATION's self-serving desire to keep the Pike committee report secret, and its extensive use of covert operations to achieve foreign policy objectives, stems from its essential belief that the American public must be prevented from participating in foreign policy decision making, a belief that has guided the conduct of U.S. foreign policy since World War II.  The Pike committee report reveals that Kissinger systematically deceived the public on the progress of the SALT agreements.  Similarly, Ford and Kissinger claimed that American intervention in Angola was merely a response to massive prior Soviet involvement, while the committee discovered that \"the military intervention of the Soviet Union and Cuba is in part a reaction to U.S. efforts to break a political stalemate in favor of its clients.\"</span></p> <p><span>Clearly, the administration's motive for concealing the truth about the SALT talks, Angola, and similar situations is its desire to forestall opposition to its policies.  Kissinger--still the single most influential figure in foreign affairs--defends his policies and the secrecy surrounding them through an appeal to transcendent \"national security interests;\" the U.S. he claims, must not \"create the impression that, in times of crisis, either threats or promises of the U.S. may not mean anything because our divisions paralyze us.\"  Kissinger implies that his policies are direct expressions of the national interest, and any opposition to or public discussion of those policies, whether in Congress or in the press, constitute an illegitimate and divisive assault on that interest.</span></p> <p><span>The Ford administration's anti-democratic and covert conduct of foreign policy is unconstitutional; it clearly usurps congressional prerogatives in that area.  But more importantly, it represents a fundamental threat to any public control over foreign policy decision making.  Americans must be able to determine the ends for which their funds and lives are expended.  This is impossible unless they know what the government is doing abroad.  The Ford administration, like its predecessors, believes that the purpose of American foreign policy should be the defense of America's status as a great power.  This requires the U.S. to defend American military and economic hegemony wherever it seems threatened, as in Vietnam and Angola.</span></p> <p><span>To prevent the continuation of the Ford administration's anti-democratic practices, the secret conduct of foreign policy must stop.  The House should reverse its previous decision and officially release the rest of the Pike committee report.  Acting on the basis of that report, Congress should prevent the CIA from undertaking further actions without scrutiny, and it should also strip the Ford administration of its power to set policy autonomously.  These solutions are admittedly incomplete, since Congress is by no means a direct representative of the American people, and has consistently failed to exercise the oversight powers it already possesses to control the use of the CIA by the executive branch.  Nevertheless these steps would make a significant contribution toward restoring foreign policy decision-making to public scrutiny and control.</span></p>"}
{"title": "A La Carter | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>THERE'S A fleeing-frontrunner motif to the Big Race so far, and bruited in the pages of the liberal press are some distinct flight images:  Ronald Reagan running hither and yon to regain $90 billion worth of lost ground; Gerald Ford running for daylight, daylight which for him must come in regular bursts on the first Friday and the 20th of each month with the proclamation of jobless and price index figures; and, most recently, Jimmy Carter running for cover from forays into his past.</span></p> <p><span>None of these men deserve to be called frontrunners, of course; their campaign gains are as yet neither lasting nor solid.  But, however prematurely they have earned the dubbing as pack leaders, the scalpels (if not hatchets) of the scrutinizers of the Fourth Estate have been waiting for them at every turn.  The press's track record with respect to Carter in the last month gives a fair indication of what to expect, both good and bad, from the journalists who gave us a very un-scrutinized Richard Nixon four years ago--they have not forgotten that egregious lapse.</span></p> <p><span>First, the good signs.  Even before the returns filtered in from Democratic delegate caucuses in Iowa and Oklahoma, which launched Carter into contender status, reporters were heading toward Atlanta to begin checking into the former Georgia governor's record and the veracity of his campaign rhetoric.  Ex-Georgia legislator Julian Bond, a black, had hinted in speeches in New England before Christmas that he, for one, was not in the Carter camp, and didn't esteem Carter as the paradigm of a civil rights candidate.  (Carter's press releases had claimed Bond and all other Georgia civil rights leaders were faithfully in the fold.)</span></p> <p><span>So Bond's hints gave the invading investigators a lead to look into, as did all those ballyhooed claims that Carter had trimmed \"Big Government\" and inefficiency in his 1970-1974 tenure in the Governor's mansion.  At the same time, out on the Iowa delegate trail, the roving press pundits following Carter took note of his expediently pliant statements on abortion.  Columnists Robert Evans and William Novak inveighed against Carter's abortion hedging, and major liberal newspapers and magazines picked up the theme.  Robert Healy, executive editor and grand polemicist of the Boston Globe, entered the fray with a series of columns denouncing Carter as a \"pseudo-liberal,\" and Marty Peretz's New Republic, reversing its favorable review of Carter in an earlier issue, took up the same chameleon chant.  One of Healy's political reporters, Curtis Wilkie, produced in the January 25 editions of the Globe the first--and to date, most even-handed piece--on Carter's guber-natorial race and subsequent administration.</span></p> <p><span>Wilkie's story told of Carter's Miachiavellian campaign against liberal ex-Governor Carl Sanders, his strategy of playing to the \"redneck\" vote and, hence, his tactic of not attacking old-time racists Lester Maddox and Roy Harris.  The story also let the air out of Carter's inflated boasts that he streamlined state government without orphaning social programs, by pointing out the confusion in the newly-created juggernaut Department of Human Resources.  But the Globe story fairly assessed the divergent opinions of experts on the outcome of Carter's efficiency measures, and pointed out both his post-election emasculation of Maddox and Harris's power and his progressive course of improving prisons, restraining banks and hiring blacks.</span></p> <p><span>On the other side of the ledger, there were some not-so-good aspects to the press's performance on Carter.  The Village Voice's Alexander Cockburn developed a monomania for blasting Carter as a \"reactionary,\" which is all very fine, but misrepresented his positions on the death penalty, aid to New York City and right-to-work laws, which is not.  Cockburn's penchant for hyperbole is particularly regrettable since his more general case, that Carter is slick and exhibits rightist tendencies, is a convincing one.  The real hatchet job, though, appeared in Harper's last week.  One of the feistier dirtdaubers in Atlanta, Steven Brill, weighed in with a piece, \"Jimmy Carter's Pathetic Lies,\" that produced the biggest stir in the campaign to date.  Carter Press Secretary Jody Powell issued a full-blown rebuttal (Globe, Feb. 6) that, while leaving certain allegations of Carter's duplicity unresolved, left little doubt that Brill played fast and loose with the facts.</span></p> <p><span>The irony of the present campaign is that all of the four leading center-to-liberal Democratic candidates who have held elective office--Carter, Harris, Bayh and Udall--are relatively progressive politicians elected from bedrock conservative constituencies.  They are tenacious politicians to have survived such milieus, and it is very possible that each has more than his share of compromise, craftiness and downright dirt lurking in his political past.</span></p> <p><span>Still, this is not to dismiss Carter's glaring vulnerabilities.  The Nation, Washington Monthly, The Progressive and other prominent liberal publications have played patsy with \"Grinny\" Jimmy Earl Carter, while their abovementioned counterparts have neglected to ask him hard questions about his halfway unemployment cures, his \"voluntary\" busing plan that has failed to integrate Atlanta schools, and his corporation-tilted tax reform proposals.  All in all, it's been a mixed performance for the boys on the bus.</span></p>"}

They are a hard-working and earnest group, generally dedicated to their House and its students.  But in allocating House funds, masters have broad discretion, and most work in too much isolation from students.</span></p> <p><span>Each master now receives approximately $24,000 to run his House, basically divided into a $3500 Ford Foundation endowment for educationally related projects, $14,000 for general House administration and $7,5000 for entertainment.  In addition, each master--with one exception--is required to live on campus, usually in fairly luxurious accommodations.  Because of faculty reluctance to accept masterships, the administration two years ago added an \"administrative stipend\" of $5000 to each master's salary.</span></p> <p><span>When surveyed, administrators and masters used conflicting terminology to describe the various House funds, and some overemphasized the extent to which the funds were intended for students.  Subsequently obtained University guidelines for the entertainment allowance show that the $7500 fund is vaguely intended to meet expenses incurred \"for the benefit of the University.\"  The guidelines suggest masters may use the fund for household staffs and functions to \"entertain students, faculty and guests of the University.\"</span></p> <p><span>But the fund is intended only for expenses \"beyond normal family social needs\" of a master, and Master Robert J. Kiely's use of a large part of the fund to hire a full-time, live-in maid at Adams House seems inappropriate.  Since at least a part of the maid's services is for Kiely's purely personal benefit, a commensurate part of her salary--as Dean Whitlock said--would \"more appropriately\" come from the administrative stipend.  There may be acceptable reasons for retaining the maid, who has been paid personally by previous Adams House masters and is two years away from retirement, but the present system appears to leave too much discretion in the hands of the master, whose expenditures are reviewed by no one.</span></p> <p><span>A check with other masters turned up no similar situation, but it did show that masters use different accounting procedures for these funds.  Some masters kept all the funds scrupulously apart, while at least one master was unable to say how much of the entertainment allowance went for student-oriented functions because he lumped all these monies in a single account.</span></p> <p><span>The funds provided for the Houses are fairly limited, and some masters quite admirably add money from their own pockets to keep the House afloat financially and expand its activities.  But the master's role in forming the House environment should not be a purely paternalistic one.  In the murky area of house funds, students should be given an increasing say in--or at least a review of--the funds that the University sets aside for their House life.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Bullish Ideas in a Bear Market | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>If you've thumbed through the pages of the Columbia Journalism Review recently and kept alert for the appurtenances of Harvard that pop up all over society, you've probably seen a Harvard Political Review advertisement.  And if you read the HPR, you've seen the Columbia Journalism ads there.  It's all part of a package deal put together two years ago by some HPR editors in an attempt to break into the national market for political journals.  Their attempt failed miserably.  In the process, however, they almost implemented a cultural revolution at the Review and left the magazine graphically improved but lacking a sense of identity as well as a financial base.</span></p> <p><span><b>Labor Pains</b></span></p> <p><span>The marketeering and promotion gimmicks that typified the HPR in 1974-75 were a far cry from the student activism which spawned the Review in the late 60's.  The first issues of the Review, beginning in April 1969, carried cover photographs of students demonstrating against the Vietnam War and against ROTC.  The prevailing message of the magazine was anti-war, but a lot of space was also devoted to campus politics.</span></p> <p><span>When the group of editors who ran the Review during this period graduated, the magazine fell into decline, publishing articles almost exclusively from experts in various fields of public policy.  That original group of editors had ties to and financial support from the Institute of Politics at Harvard; when the Review was rejuvenated in 1972-73, it was under the editorship of Simeon Kriesberg '73, chairman of the Institute's Student Advisory Council (SAC).</span></p> <p><span>Under Kriesberg, the magazine was completely revised to include many student contributions, staff articles, and outside submissions from freshmen congressmen and Institute Fellows among others.  Kriesberg and Gary Meisel '74, SAC members, served terms as editors, and the Student Advisory Committee provided most of the Review's income.  But changes were in the wind.</span></p> <p><span><b>Hot to Trot in a Cultural Revolution</b></span></p> <p><span>Two years ago were the golden days between Nixon's 1971-72 \"garden variety\" recession and the unheralded advent of the '74-75 abject slump.  Rick Mendelson '75, whom everyone describes as \"a very bright and high-powered guy,\" had just become editor of the Harvard Political Review, bringing with him the seeds of a cultural revolution.  Mendelson's predilictions were towards graphics, promotion, and marketing, as were those of his associate editor, Tim Bliss '75.  They thought that with a slicker-looking product the Review could appeal to a much wider audience than just the Harvard wastebaskets where it had languished so long.</span></p> <p><span><b>After one issue in the old style, Mendelson</b> and Bliss approached the Student Advisory Committee, which published the Review, with a package of proposals for wholesale design revamping, trading advertisements with other periodicals, and extended fund-raising.  Mendelson asked the SAC for an increased subsidy, anticipating a one- or two-year stimulus which would set the Review firmly on the road to self-sufficiency and entry into the national periodical market.  Like a parent putting out those last few thousands of dollars for college, hoping that the degree insures the kid's future, the SAC went along.</span></p> <p><span>First results were positive.  Graphically, the magazine shed its basement-mimeograph image.  According to Mark J. Saylor '76, who succeeded Mendelson as editor, \"Rick had an abiding faith in professionals--that first issue was designed by a student at the Design School (Scott Reid and Associates)--and the cover was drawn by a professional artist in Los Angeles who still does our cover.\"  There were three times as many photographs and illustrations as in the previous issue, and a sharp new logo took its place on a stiff-paper color-coded cover.</span></p> <p><span>Mandelson's fund-raising schemes for '74-75 looked just as promising.  With the advice of professionals at the Harvard Development Office and various Institute of Politics contacts, the Review staff came up with a list of 61 potential \"very large donors.\"  The plan was to send information packets out to these individuals and to follow up the packets with personal communication.  Mendelson expected to raise $10,000 or more a year from this list, enough to cover the Review's total budget, and to begin amassing funds for an extensive subscription drive.</span></p> <p><span>On the marketing and promotion side, ads for such periodicals as the Columbia Journalism Review, The New Republic, The Nation, and Washington Monthly began to appear in the HPR, in exchange for free space in those publications for HPR ads.  The number of subscriptions rose from only 20 under the old format to over 200 by February 1976.  The staff sent out the large donor packets and waited.</span></p> <p><span><b>Swamped By the High Seas of Recession</b></span></p> <p><span>1975 was by no means the best year for an expansion-minded periodical.  By January the Nixon/Ford/Arthur Burns recession had burst out full-blown and was still hanging around with lots of its old vigor in December.  Even such a sound, conservative, well-connected publication as National Review ran in the red in 1975.  The only successful new entrant in the periodical market was the glossy, gossipy, photo-filled People magazine, backed by Time, Inc. Money was tight in 1975.</span></p> <p><span>Of the 61 people on the Harvard Political Review's large donor list, only 24 expressed any further interest after receiving the packet.  Of these, three eventually contributed to the Review, for a total of $52,000.  As Saylor later wrote in his report on this failure, \"Our rate of return was only 5 per cent on a list that cannot possibly be matched for selectivity,\" and those returns \"appear likely to be one-time contributions rather than a continuing commitment.\"</span></p> <p><span>There was one bright spot on the fundraising scene.  After consultation with Marty Peretz of The New Republic and other fundraising wizards, the Review staff set up after Christmas 1974 a \"Friends of the Harvard Political Review\" program, consisting of mailed issues of the HPR (with letters asking for regular fifteen-to-twenty dollar contributions) to former Fellows of the Institute and people affiliated with the Kennedy School of Government.  According to Saylor, \"There's been a good response to our first mailings--it looks promising.\"  But even an optimistic estimate of Friends' support amounts to less than 15 per cent of the Review's yearly expenses.</span></p> <p><span>There are two other independent sources for HPR income--subscriptions and advertisements.  In some of the pre-cultural revolution issues, there was as much \"advertising contributed for the public good\" as there were paid ads.  This had changed under the new format, but the expanded costs of publishing the new Review more than negate any increase in its advertising space.  The income from ads in each issue covers less than a third of its publishing expenses.</span></p> <p><span>As for subscriptions, the only remaining hope for HPR self-sufficiency, the outlook is dim.  Despite the tenfold increase in subscriptions, Saylor estimates that for complete independence a subscription increase of over 3000 would be needed.  To achieve such an increase, according to Saylor, would involve a mass mailing of over 100,000, the costs of which would be twice the Review's annual budget.  After more than 75 years existence, The New Republic has a subscription list of less than 25,000; despite and extensive campaign to increase the list of subscribers, success has been minimal.  The New Republic's inability to boost its circulation provides ample evidence of a non-expanding market for political analysis; under such tight conditions, the Review had no choice but to troop back to the Student Advisory Committee and ask for continued subsidization at the '74-75 levels.</span></p> <p><span><b>Self-Criticism and Revisionist History</b></span></p> <p><span>In return for assurances of continued SAC support, the committee demanded a detailed accounting of why the Review's expected \"take-off\" into the national market fizzled.  1975-76 became a time for re-evaluation of the Review by its editors, with some startling conclusions.  Incoming Review president George H. White '77 calls Mendelson's and Bliss's conceptions of what it would take to break into the national market \"idealistic and unrealistic.\"  \"They talked to people over at the Harvard Business Review, and not to other political journals,\" says White.</span></p> <p><span>Saylor terms the Mendelson period an \"identity crisis--we were losing our identity as a political journal.\"  White agrees:  \"Rick and Tim viewed the Review more as a marketable product than anything else.  Their entrepreneurial spirit was permeating the editorial staff.\"  Saylor says that Mendelson and Bliss's pursuit of professional content and production and a firm financial base \"soon became transformed into a sort of entrepreneurial game.  With all the interest in marketing we kind of lost sight of what kind of magazine we were putting out.\"  Even the SAC had harsh words for Mendelson and Bliss:  \"Nothing like the optimistic goals that the previous editors had suggested was possible.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>Retrenchment</b></span></p> <p><span>George White believes there's no reason not to have long-range expansion goals.  His period of re-evaluation \"hasn't made me pessimistic--just made me want to concentrate on the things we're doing well.\"  White includes in his list of positive developments the expanding involvement of members of the Harvard community in all aspects of HPR operations and the \"nice balance\" of contributions from students on the staff and outside writers, at a ratio of three to two.  \"The Harvard Political Review isn't a national magazine at all,\" says White.  \"It's a forum for political analysis and a service to Harvard students, most of whom don't get much political analysis in whatever newspapers and newsweeklies they read.\"</span></p> <p><span>The philosophy that Mark Saylor is bequeathing to White is based on the desire to \"publish people who wouldn't otherwise be published.\"  Saylor professes an aversion to publishing professors:  \"They have their own academic journals, and besides, sometimes they give us and Public Interest say, similar articles.\"  Saylor and White are looking first of all for student political writing, and second, for off-beat articles by people who do get published all the time but would never ordinarily write pieces out of their fields.  Nieman Fellows are a case in point--James Scudder, a city editor for the Arkansas <i>Democrat,</i> wrote on power vacuums and irresponsibility at Harvard in the HPR last winter.</span></p> <p><span>White looks forward to a time when a large staff will enable the Review to explore new fields and present diverging views on the same issues, as in the most recent HPR when two staffers disagreed about aid to cities.  Likewise, in the next issue of the Review, several contributors will react to Martha Gershun's article urging continued and expanded U.S. participation in the United Nations.  Another upcoming feature, which White calls \"as close as we can get to investigative reporting considering our month-long lead times,\" is an account of the Howard Hughes/Glomar Explorer affair.</span></p> <p><span>It remained for the old-hand outgoing editor Saylor to add the sobering note:  \"Really, though, our only general philosophy is just stabilizing the magazine, making sure that we'll be coming out the following year\"--and making sure those advertisements stay in the Columbia Journalism Review</span></p>"}
{"title": "The Crowd Pleasers | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>WO DAYS AGO the Real Paper released a poll conducted by a University of New Hampshire political science class showing that less than two weeks ago more than 40 per cent of those eligible to vote in the primary today were still undecided about who to pick.  The poll is just one of several showing an unusually large percentage of uncommitted voters, and it's indicative of a certain mood in the primary that may set the tone of the race right up until the national conventions this summer:  the presidential contenders are just gushing with rhetoric, they move like reeds in the wind, swaying from week to week--and in some cases, from hour to hour--without any firm commitment or even lip service to issues or ideology.</span></p> <p><span>This follows in the New Hampshire tradition of \"political\" primaries, of William Loeb, the kike-teaser, the publisher who turned steadfast Edmund Muskie into a tear-filled bundle of Ibogaine-scotted nerves on a flatbed truck in 1972.  But this primary is greater than William Loeb, who incidentally has gone so far to remove his image of slander-mongerer as to publish Democratic candidates' press releases largely uncut and unedited.  The 1976 primary's rhetoric is too thick, fast and furious for Loeb to pin any one candidate down--although it is to Birch Bayh's credit that he's received an editorial blast against his stands on gun control and abortion.</span></p> <p><span>If it is politicking that is shaping this year's New Hampshire primary, then the kind of \"political\" image being presented by the two upstart candidates, Reagan and Carter, is worth looking into, if only to explain what might happen at today's polls.  Inconsistencies crop up even more often, it seems, than the press has been reporting, especially at the \"Citizens\" Press Conferences\" held by Reagan and the similar \"Town Meetings\" held by Democratic candidates.</span></p> <p><span>Inconsistencies.  A photographer for Gamma Photo Agency is on the trail for two weeks; he speaks with the kind of cynicism bred in the anti-war movement and demonstrations against war-engineer Walt Rostow, where Rostow says something like, \"I've never seen the effects of napalm but it can't be all <i>that</i> bad,\" and he (photographer, then student) turns down house lights and starts up a film showing bombs falling on North Vietnam, while Rostow (unaware of screen behind) continues to defend the war.  That cynicism creeps back when the Gamma man talks about Reagan who, according to the Village Voice, last week justified rejecting amnesty by saying that the war should have been made legal and the U.S. should have stayed in there and won.</span></p> <p><span>The hero of the story:  Allen Franken, young, just out of college, writes for NBC's new Saturday Night comedy show.  The setting:  Franken gets NBC press pass and follows Reagan around for a day in the backwaters of New Hampshire.  The confrontation:  the young turk gets Reagan's attention, violating a press hands-off policy during a \"Citizens' Press Conference.\"  The question, second-hand, is this:  \"Uh, Mr. Reagan, it seems today that you've said some contradictory things, and I'd like to inquire about it.  At one point today, you told a group of people that you were against legislation of marijuana because you had read a study somewhere saying that it caused 'brain-damage.'  At another point during the day you told another crowd that you were against laws requiring motor-cyclists to wear crash helmets because you thought it wasn't the government's job to legislate against actions by people that would harm only themselves.  It's clear that anybody on a motorcycle going down the road at 60 mph is going to suffer brain damage if he crashes and hits his head, but there is no available evidence of any marijuana users ever suffering brain damage.  Mr. Reagan, how can you explain this fraudulent civil libertarianism?\"</span></p> <p><span>The answer:  several shades of green and red.  The evasion:  composed Reagan shoots back that he'd rather have a pilot flying his airplane drunk than high on grass because then he could tell that he was drunk and get him the hell out of there.  Simple, sharp, insouciant, irrelevant, inconsistent.</span></p> <p><span>Epilogue:  as he gets back on the press bus, Matthew Russo, Reagan's assistant press secretary rips up kid Franken's press pass, telling him he's really not a reporter anyway.</span></p> <p><span><b>R</b>EAGAN TWISTS and turns like a rattlesnake.  When his invest-Social-Security-Trust-funds-in-the-stock-market concept didn't go over too well, he said he had only cited an expert's opinion.  At a press conference on television two weeks ago Reagan was asked a specific question about a particular item on his list of $90 billion cuts in the federal budget.  Again he said that these were expert economists who drew up this list and he had consulted with them and everything, but, uh, he wasn't quite aware of that particular item because, uh, these were trusted economists... he hadn't looked at the list yet is what he finally said, and he hadn't really approved it yet either.</span></p> <p><span>However well Reagan is doing in the polls, he lost at least one supporter last weekend.  Crimson photographer Tim Carlson spotted John Paul Laremy, an 8-year-old New Hampshireite at the Reagan rally in Manchester's huge smoke-filled armory.  Paul was wearing three Reagan stickers on the back of his coat.  The next night Carlson saw the same kid at the Carter rally in the East Ballroom of the Carpenter Motor Hotel, holding a \"Jimmy Carter for President\" sign.  He investigated this sudden shift in allegiance and John Paul had this to say for his previous night's three stickers:  \"Why, isn't Mister Reagan still an actor?\"  Non-voting Laremy still hadn't explained why he supported the former governor from Georgia, until he said, \"But, if Mister Carter is president I don't think he'll tell a lie.\"</span></p> <p><span>A Boston journalist, cooped up in the Carpenter with a few drinks under his belt, smiled quietly when he heard the story about the Reagan-Carter switch:  \"The kid's right, they're both exactly the same.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>F RONALD REAGAN is a slithering reptile with rhetoric, Carter is a Snake Oil vendor.  Last Saturday night at a Democratic Forum he sold himself like medicine that would cure a hundred diseases.  And he would've named them if he could have--because Carter likes to fill time and his listeners' ears with long catalogues of problems, kinds of people, possible solutions, more kinds of people, another problem, another catalogue of the American character, etc.  \"We've got a good country,\" he says, mountains, fields, streams, valleys, you name it.  \"And we have a good system of government.  Nixon, Watergate, Vietnam, Cambodia, ... haven't hurt it.\"  There are problems, Carter says--unemployment, inflation--but he believes in the American character:  \"strength, wisdom, intelligence, courage...\"  The only specific solution he volunteered that was close to being specific was a new \"sunshine law\" to \"open up the government\" to public scrutiny.</span></p> <p><span>Even during a questioning session, Carter doesn't get specific.  When asked last Saturday about how he'd deal with management in the upcoming union contract negotiations this fall, Carter generalized.  \"There's no predictability about what's going to happen next,\" he says about the economy, then drifts into vague economic reforms before saying briefly that he could be a \"center\" for negotiations.  And even when asked to \"be precise\" about a full employment program, Carter will only say Americans have to sell more products abroad, the government must \"remove incentives for corporations to move overseas,\" and \"channel R&amp;D into areas that would have greater impact on our jobs.\"  There are no hows or whys behind anything he says.  Just teeth--Cheshire cat teeth with an elusive image behind him.</span></p> <p><span>The Gamma photographer says a Peking news agency reporter covering the primary thinks Carter is  \"velly stlong\" (or something to that effect).</span></p> <p><span>Thomas L. Kelleher, a lawyer from Montana, isn't running in the New Hampshire primary.  He's running in the Massachusetts Democratic primary next week, though, and he has some interesting thoughts to offer all the candidates for the rest of the presidential primary circuit:  he supports a parliamentary form of government because with this system, he says, \"Elections are based on <i>issues, not personalities.\"</i></span></p> <p><span>Reagan and Carter don't represent the entire spectrum of campaign images offered by candidates, but they seem to define right and center choices that, broadly speaking, make up the field.  And if their basic approaches remain the same until the convention, Robert Kelleher's slogan sounds awfully appealing.  The thick-eyebrowed attorney wants you to \"Elect the Last President.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "Mo Udall in the Land of the Blind | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>L</b>AST TUESDAY night in Manchester, New Hampshire, after the primary results showed Representative Morris K. Udall in second place behind former Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter, Udall said New Hampshire was where his campaign finally \"took off.\"  The next evening, in Sanders Theater, Udall said that Massachusetts would be the state where his campaign took off. If it doesn't get off the ground here in Tuesday's presidential primary, Mo Udall might as well fly himself back to Arizona and run for the Senate.</span></p> <p><span>The field for tomorrow's primary is crowded and confused.  There are seven major candidates:  Udall, Senator Birch Bayh, R. Sargent Shriver, and former Oklahoma Senator Fred Harris are hoping to capture the liberal vote; Alabama Governor George C. Wallace and Senator Henry M. Jackson are after the more conservative, anti-busing Democrats; and Jimmy Carter is trying to appeal to just about everybody.</span></p> <p><span>Udall, like all the others, has been trying to set himself apart from the field in some way.  So far, he has pursued this end by claiming that he alone has concentrated on the issues.</span></p> <p><span>The press package Udall's staff put together and distributes to reporters who board the Udall press van for the first time is thick with mimeographed position papers.  In addition to his biography and favorable press clippings, there is a collection of 31 legal-sized single-spaced pages titled \"Congressman Morris K. Udall Addresses the Issues.\"  There are also five \"Regional Papers\" specifically addressed to New England:  \"New England's Energy Problem,\" \"New England Consumers,\" and so on.  Finally, there is the blizzard of press releases Udall has sent out in the past few weeks--on Roxbury's developmental problems, on the future of Fort Devens, even on Red Dye No. 2 Summing up all this mimeographed effort, Udall often says.  \"I've talked in more detail about the issues than any other candidate in this campaign.\"</span></p> <p><span>Udall is justifiably proud of that statement.  He is at his best when answering questions about his stand on just about anything.  In contrast to Jimmy Carter, whose blinding smile and \"Hi--I'm Jimmy Carter,\" introduction have made him an effective personal campaigner, Udall stands woodenly, smiles slightly, shakes hands perfunctorily, and says merely, \"Hello, nice to see you,\" and then lumbers on.</span></p> <p><span>But Udall's constituency is made up of the kind of people who like to read about \"the issues,\" and who like to have their questions about the safety of Red Dye No. 2 answered--middle- and upper middle-class liberals.  Again, there is in Udall's campaign a sharp contrast with Jimmy Carter, who said last week that he would not detail many of his positions until after he received the nomination.  That strategy may seem incredible to Udall's issueoriented liberals in Massachusetts, but Carter is sure it will help him to come out on top in New York.</span></p> <p><span>Massachusetts is filled with the middle-class liberals that Udall appeals to, especially in Boston's bedroom suburbs.  Udall should do well there, and in his pre-election speeches, he bills Massachustts as the \"test state\" for the liberal Democratic candidates.  The liberal Democrats should \"coalesce\" around the liberal candidate with the strongest showing in Massachusetts, he says, confident that he will be that liberal.</span></p> <p><span>On April 6, however, the traveling primary circus moves to New York, and Bayh contends that the acid test for liberals should come then.  Bayh says that he has a strong organization in New York, and has put together more delegate slates there than any other liberal candidate.  Now running scared, Bayh hopes to finish well enough in Massachusetts to continue on through to New York.</span></p> <p><span>The problem, for Bayh, Udall, and Shriver, is money--they're running out.  Although several candidates spent close to the federal limit of about $200,000 in New Hampshire, nobody is going to come close to the $600,000 limit for Massachusetts.  Jackson is spending about $400,000, but Udall has spent only about $275,000 so far.  And he fears that unless one or two of the liberal Democrats drop out after tomorrow, the liberal money will be split among them all, and no one will have enough to wage an effective campaign in New York.  Even Bayh, with his large organization, will be paralyzed unless he has enough to make it work--money for telephones, literature, billboards, and radio and television time.</span></p> <p><span>And in Massachusetts, there are dangers in relying solely on middle-class liberals, and Udall has been campaigning for other votes.  Unlike Bayh and Jackson, Udall is not popular with organized labor.  His only union endorsement so far is from the Massachusetts Teachers Association, which is not a trade union but an organization of white-collar professionals.  And on Friday morning he went into East Boston and met workers who had just been laid off, that evening he went to Worcester for a \"time\" Udall's term for a reception, where the crowd was primarily Italian-American working-class people.  His greeting there was warm, but several voters said they still liked Jackson and Wallace.</span></p> <p><span>From Worcester, Udall drove to a reception in Wellesley at a supporter's home.  It was a typical wine-and-cheese gathering, but a local Democratic official said that of a normal 11,000-voter turnout in Wellesley, only 1700 are Democrats.  Why would Udall bother with such a small town?  Money.  After the reception, a Udall staffer said, \"We just made $3000 in there.\"</span></p> <p><span>One of Udall's main campaign tactics is the endorsement.  From Archibald Cox and Tip O'Neill down through Hale Champion and newly-elected State Representative William Mullin '75, Udall has been collecting as many names as he can find--so far, he has a list of over 70 Massachusetts endorsements.</span></p> <p><span>The man whose name Udall most frequently drops, however, isn't around to comment on his role in the Udall campaign.  At every Massachusetts streetcorner stop in the last few days, Udall begins by saying that 16 years ago he campaigned in Arizona for \"a young man running for president from Massachusetts--John Kennedy.\"  Even though Kennedy's brother-in-law is running against him, Udall never fails to mention his JFK connection.</span></p> <p><span>In Roxbury on Saturday morning, a man watching Udall and his entourage of staffers and reporters from his doorstep shouted, \"Is that Birch Bayh?\"  On Friday night a Worcester politician introduced \"Senator Udall\" to the crowd.  Udall is still struggling for recognition, but may yet do well, or even win tomorrow.  He should certainly do well in Cambridge, even without an endorsement from rumored-supporter President Bok.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Italian Communism and U.S. Foreign Policy | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>HE emergence of the Communist Party (PC) as a dominant force in Italian politics poses a dramatic challenge to the whole course of American policy toward Europe since World War II.  At the onset of the Cold War, Italy, like other European countries, was the site of a pitched political and ideological battle between pro-Western and pro-Communist forces, with the two superpowers assisting their respective allies diplomatically and financially.  Conceivably left and right could have reconciled if the superpowers' rivalry had not polarized political life.  In fact, for a brief while, Communists, Socialists and the conservative Christian Democrats (DC) all cooperated in a coalition government.</span></p> <p><span>But after the DC triumphed in the crucial 1948 election against the combined \"popular front\" forces of the left, the direction of post-war Italian politics changed.  The U.S.-backed DC founded their government on an anti-communism platform and drew the lines of political onflict that have continued to the present.  And since that time, American foreign policy has pivoted around the central theme of anti-Communism; as long as the PC was excluded from power, American policy makers eyed the Italian peninsula contentedly.</span></p> <p><span>For nearly thirty years, the operation of the Italian political system did little to threaten this anti-Communist premise.  Nationally, the Christian Democrats have ruled uninterruptedly since the war.  The Communist Party has been relegated to the role of opposition, able to apply pressures from without, but deprived of ministerial responsibilities, unable to influence government policy from within.  Locally the PC's record reflected a laudable efficiency--but until recently, the party never seriously contended for national power.</span></p> <p><span>But in the last decade the situation has changed drastically.  Secure in its working class, the PC began to approach non-proletarian sectors of Italian society, modifying the party line to become more amenable to a larger portion of the electorate.  After regional elections last June, the PC found itself only two percentage points away from becoming the largest party in the country.  Meanwhile the American-supported DC has matched the PC's rise with a spectacular decline of its own.  Corrupt, fragmented, and stagnant, the DC is split into nine factions with separate organizations and politics, whose laders have run the party for the past 20 years.  The DC's poor performance has allowed the PC to reap windfall political profits.</span></p> <p><span>Though unforseen, the rise of the Communist Party is not accidental.  Since the late fifties, the party has steadily forged its own particular brand of Communism, substituting gradualist mass politics and a broad electoral appeal in place of proletarian revolution.  Since the late fifties--especially after Hungary--the IC has shown increasing independence from Moscow, to the point of regularly denouncing Soviet policies.  The grand political design of the party, nurtured by its first post war leader Pamiro Togliatti and continued by current party secretary Enrico Berlinguer, pointed toward the attainment of political power by democratic means.  And in June 1975, when the PC boasted control of five of Italy's regions and control of three of its four major cities, the party had ostensibly accomplished what Togliatti had set out to do:  it had moved to the brink of political power.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>FTER THE JUNE elections the State Department finally realized what had been happening in Italian politics during the last ten years.  The decline of Christian Democracy and the corresponding rise of the PC, as confirmed by the June vote, left Washington shocked and worried.  To counteract this red surge, President Ford targeted $6 million in foreign aid, to be channelled through the CIA for distribution among individual politicians in the anti-Communist cause.</span></p> <p><span>Now the surprise at the results of the June elections already betrays a general ignorance of Italian social and political affairs, since the elections simply confirmed what had been going on in plain sight for nearly a decade.  But then to think that giving money to anti-Communist politicians would stem the rising red tide raises misunderstanding to the level of folly.  Admittedly, Italian politicians are a notoriously corrupt bunch.  Even the PC has taken a bribe or two in its day from large American companies (it was disclosed last year that Gulf had contributed several million dollars to PC election campaigns).  But of all the politicians in Italy the DC anti-Communists to whom the money was presumably targeted are perhaps the most corrupt.  One recently retired State Department official, with wisdom evidently lacking in his superiors, remarked, \"You can bet a lot of that money will end up in villas, vacation homes and Swiss bank accounts in the names of Italian politicians.\"  As should have been apparent to the State Department by now, aiding anti-Communists in this manner is like pumping adrenalin into a dead corpse.</span></p> <p><span>This tactic makes even less sense since anti-Communism itself soon will become entirely obsolete in the Italian context.  Barring a miracle (and no doubt the fervent anti-Communist Pope Paul prays for this nightly) the PC will receive a plurality in the national elections next year.  The Italian weekly Expresso recently released a poll indicating that an election at the present time would give the PC such a victory.  In that case, the PC could not be denied participation--of some variety--in the government.  It is clear then that anti-Communism will soon cease to be a viable instrument of foreign policy.  No matter how much money or State Department rhetoric is aimed at Italy there will be Communists in the government within a year.</span></p> <p><span>Yet in the face of such inescapable realities, the U.S. turns the other way, thinking that dogmatism and intransigence can somehow dissipate the spectre.  Secretary of State Kissinger has continually repeated that Communist participation in the government will be \"unacceptable.\"  What Kissinger probably hopes for is the \"portugalization\" of Italy, the substitution of social democracy for communism.  But the Italian Socialists have much less support than the PC.  Ironically, though, the policies of the PC are very similar to those of most Western European socialist parties, whose participation in power the U.S. tolerates.  In fact, much of the tension between the U.S. and the PC stems from lack of understanding.</span></p> <p><span>Beginning this past year, the party has sought a dialogue with the U.S.  Last summer the PC approached members of the Council on Foreign Relations stationed in Como, Italy.  One staff member, Zygmunt Nagorski, was enough impressed by the PC's candor and sincerity--and moderation of outlooks and political demands--that he wrote an editorial that appeared in the New York times arguing for a more constructive policy towards the PC.  He observed that:</span></p> <p><span>1) the PC's brand of communism is not of the totalitarian Eastern European order, but one amenable to the rules of liberal social democracy.</span></p> <p><span>2) the PC fears Moscow as much as anyone else in Europe and so would support, rather than undermine NATO.</span></p> <p><span>3) the PC's record of efficiency and dependability is outstanding and unmatched by any party in Italy.  In as much as it is a legitimate, potent electoral force, it cannot be kept out of power indefinitely.</span></p> <p><span><b>Y</b>ET FOR ALL their persuasiveness and intelligence these arguments have fallen on deaf ears.  Until now, the State Department has shown no sympathy or wish for \"dialogue\" with the PC.  In fact, their actions display an attitude closer to contempt.  This past fall, for instance, several prominent members of the PC were denied entry into the U.S. under an archaic, seldom-used anti-Communist statute.  This minor act of hostility was followed by an even stiffer slap in the face as neo-Fascist Giorgio Almirante, who is among the most reactionary politicians in Italy, paraded around Capitol Hill talking with Congressional leaders.  Incidentally, the same law which barred Communists from entry into the U.S. supposedly also barred neo-fascists.</span></p> <p><span>Secretary Kissinger gives the cold shoulder to any Italian politicians favoring the \"historic compromise,\" that is, Communist participation in the government.  One such politician, Francesco DeMartino, the highly-respected leader of the Socialist Party and until now a member of the pro-Western left, was originally scheduled to visit Washington with a group of Italian parliamentarians.  However, when it was discovered that DeMartino intended to express his opinion to Secretary Kissinger in favor of PC cooperation in the government, he was politely told by CIA agents that his presence in the U.S. was unnecessary.  The Secretary was not going to be told what he didn't want to hear.</span></p> <p><span>So the PC remains anathema for U.S. foreign policy.  It promises to continue that way as long as Secretary Kissinger remains in office, since his obdurate view of PC \"unacceptability\" shows no signs of relaxing.  What will the administration do, assuming it's still around next year, when the PC wins its expected majority?</span></p> <p><span>Several options are open.  There's always the interventionist approach:  covert operations, Chile-style, via the CIA.  American citizens may dismiss this possibility, treating Chile as an aberration which could not be repeated in western Europe.  But the Italians themselves fear this possibility more than any other and in self-defense have published all the names of top-level CIA agents in Italy.</span></p> <p><span>Blown covers for their CIA agents provides one reason why the U.S. should not pursue this angle.  In addition to this tactical disadvantage, there are other reasons for avoiding intervention.  Covert CIA operations would not at this point be acceptable to U.S. allies in Europe.  CIA intervention would certainly alienate most pro-western forces in Italy, leaving the U.S. with few allies.  Finally, there is no right-wing military establishment which could succeed a possible Communist government.  Neo-fascism is a possibility, but only at the cost of civil war.  Due to all their governmental instability and endless political crises, post-war Italian politics has given the nation a strong pluralistic tradition, and a great respect for civil liberties.</span></p> <p><span>More plausible than direct intervention, since anti-CIA feeling runs high in the U.S. as well, is a policy of making life difficult for any government that included the PC.  Economic pressures could be applied along with withdrawal of international credits, and in Italy's current economic crisis, these measures could have decisive effects.  Or the U.S. could oppose Italian participation in NATO and the Common Market.</span></p> <p><span>But the most unfortunate aspect of U.S. policy toward Italy is that it is counter-productive even on its own terms.  As Professor Peter Lange argues in an article in the current issue of \"Foreign Policy,\" the \"oppose at all costs,\" anti-PC feeling in the State Department works against U.S. interests.  Because though U.S. opposition might at first keep the PC out of the government, it would not encourage reform in the DC.  After thirty years of rule a stint in the opposition may well be what the DC needs to recover its health.  And of all the major parties, only a reformed DC stands as a possible alternative to the PC.  Lange adds that dogged U.S. opposition to the PC may force the party to seek alliances elsewhere, like Moscow, something neither the PC not the U.S. regards as a favorable alternative.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b> MORE SENSIBLE foreign policy toward the PC includes--or rather should start with--some constructive dialogue.  The State Department should open its doors to members of the PC who wish to come to this country to lecture or talk with State Department officials.  Rudeness and denial of the PC's existence hinders, rather than advances, foreign relations.  In addition, a more lenient attitude towards the \"historic compromise\" would be wise.  Such a change in attitude could act as a signal of goodwill so that an alliance could begin on a basis of friendship and trust.  In the long run, such an alliance would benefit the U.S., since cooperation with the PC would ensure a stronger Italy.  A stronger Italy, in turn, would help promote a stronger Western Europe, a central U.S. foreign policy objective.  But above all, the CIA must be kept clear of U.S.-Italian relations.  The agency is fast becoming an Italian national joke, and every time more CIA actions become public knowledge, relations are strained even more between the two countries.</span></p> <p><span>While such a policy change seems unlikely under the present steadfastly anti-Communist administration, it seems possible that the election year may produce a constructive approach, after, of course, the Republican nomination is settled.  The U.S. needs a policy that understands and accepts rather than fears Italian Communism.  But if the U.S. fails to develop such a policy, the imminent ascension of the PC to power may precipitate a sharp collision between Italy and the U.S.</span></p>"}

{"title": "The Politics of Anti-Politics | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>L</b>AST TUESDAY'S New Hampshire primary had the unfortunate result of propelling former Gov. Jimmy Carter of Georgia into the lead for the Democratic presidential nomination.  It is important that his candidacy be dealt a shattering blow in this Tuesday's Massachusetts primary.</span></p> <p><span>Jimmy Carter's presidential campaign exploits one of the worst features of American politics--the tendency to treat political issues as if they were not political issues at all, but simply questions of personality and efficient administration.  \"I will never tell a lie,\" Carter avows with metronome-like regularity.  \"I will never make a misleading statement.  I won't avoid a controversial issue.  I promise never to embarrass you.  If I ever do any of these things, then you shouldn't support me.  I don't deserve your support.\"</span></p> <p><span>A poll conducted by The New York Times and Daniel Yankelovich after last week's New Hampshire primary demonstrates how successful Carter has been in camouflaging his politics.  Twenty-two per cent of those asked perceived him as liberal; twenty-two per cent saw him as conservative; and thirty-two per cent described him as moderate.</span></p> <p><span>In presenting the office of the presidency as devoid of ideological content, Carter is of course perpetrating the biggest lie of all.  The powers traditionally associated with the presidency--the power to push or to veto legislation, the administration of defense and social welfare appropriations, the setting of domestic and foreign policy priorities--all have direct political consequences.  It requires an astonishing naivete to believe differently.</span></p> <p><span>Jimmy Carter is not naive.  He is merely attempting to capitalize on the mood of the electorate that regards politics as entirely corrupt and wishes to believe that government can be run entirely on the basis of honesty and efficiency.  In fact, by penetrating the haze Carter has attempted to create around his campaign and record as governor of Georgia, one finds his stands are perfectly congruent with the attitudes of Southern conservatism.</span></p> <p><span>Carter has always opposed busing, abortion reform, and until this year, a federal takeover of welfare.  He has favored right-to-work laws, the death penalty and preventive detention, and opposed federal aid to New York City.  His right-wing approach to international affairs is vividly reflected in his selection of Dean Rusk as his foreign policy advisor.  The central theme of Carter's campaign has been the need to trim federal bureaucracy, specifically welfare bureaucracy; such language masks a more fundamental desire to realign governmental priorities and to eliminate the social welfare programs of the 60's.  The brunt of this new austerity will of course be borne by poor and working people.  \"I think you will find,\" Carter's press secretary wrote in 1972, \"that Senator Jackson, Governor Wallace and [Carter] are in close agreement on most issues.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>E AGREE.  Jackson and Wallace state outright what Carter merely implies--that America's ills stem from the federal government's attempt to aid the poor and minorities.  Wallace speaks to genuine issues such as unemployment and inflation, but in a wholly destructive and superficial manner, diverting the electorate's attention from the roots of these problems in America's social structure.  Instead, Wallace chooses to focus his appeal solely on divisive issues such as busing which are only manifestations of much more profound conflicts in American life.  Jackson has been tripping over himself in his attempt to present himself as more reactionary than Wallace.  Between the two of them they have articulated an insidious politics of hatred and have pandered shamelessly to racism and status-anxiety.</span></p> <p><span>At this point, it appears Rep.Morris Udall (D-Az.) has emerged as the front-runner among liberal candidates, but Udall has little to offer in the way of alternative approaches to social and economic problems beyond an outworn reworking of Kennedy liberalism, emphasizing the environment.  In fact, until recently, his campaign rhetoric fed into the right wing attack on social programs by urging the American people to lower their expectations in the face of scarce resources.  Nor do other liberal candidates like Sen. Birch Bayh (D-Ind.) and R. Sargent Shriver have more substantive solutions for the social and economic crisis which faces America today.  Though they, like Udall, support full employment, they have no idea about the ways in which this could be put into effect and have failed to address themselves to the structural sources of the country's ills:  the economic and political power of American corporations.</span></p> <p><span>Only Fred Harris has attempted to provoke meaningful discussion about the distribution of economic and social power, to treat American politics in class terms.  But Harris's substantive programs are not very different from the rest of the liberal candidates, and his neo-populist perspective often leads him to propose anachronistic solutions which would not bring about the far-reaching changes his ideology points to.  But the terms of analysis that Harris has used in his campaign are a refreshing antidote to the politics of anti-political deception, fear, and hatred that have so far dominated the 1976 presidential campaign.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Will Germans Always be Germans? | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The German Federal Republic promises to be the political and economic success of Western Europe in the 1970s.  Led by its forceful and charismatic Chancellor, Helmut Schmidt, West Germany is the dominant economic power of Western Europe and is rapidly becoming one of the pivotal political forces of the European continent.  Needless to say, the role is not a new one:  a Germany that is no longer fearful, penitent, and psychologically crushed by the outrages of WW II is cause for concern to neighbors and adversaries.  Some are disturbed by the resurgence of German political and economic power and wonder if the bitter Gaullist maxim that \"Les Allemands seront toujours les Allemands\" will not be true again.  At the same time, however, it is welcome to see, in a Western Europe staggered by political mismanagement, divided over the rise of the Left, and weakened by the international economic recession, West Germany represents a haven of political stability and economic prosperity.</span></p> <p><span>The economy is the most outstanding feature of West Germany today.  Resilient, disciplined, and resourceful, the German economy weathered the international economic recession on a far more even keel than its European neighbors.  Like the rest of the export-oriented European economies, it was hard-hit by the downturn in world trade and the quadrupling of oil prices in 1973.  Nevertheless, while an 8.5 per cent rate of inflation and a 6.5 per cent rate of unemployment earned Schmidt sharp criticism from the right and the left, these figures were downright enviable compared to the double-digit inflation and widespread unemployment of other Western nations, including the United States.  Replacing the disgraced Willy Brandt, Schmidt immediately clamped down on inflation:  his monetary policies were so strict that the German construction industry almost went out of business for lack of credit.  Schmidt's vigorous economic measures paid off:  inflation was down to five per cent in 1975 and the economy enjoyed a moderate economic comeback.  Inflation is currently running at 4.1 per cent and the German economy is expected to earn a huge trade surplus this year.</span></p> <p><span>German economists are happy to point out that moderate wage demands on the part of German labor unions paved the way for Schmidt's successful fiscal and monetary policies.  Unlike British, French, or Italian labor unions, German labor unions practice a remarkable degree of cooperation with corporate management and do not regard government as an adversary.</span></p> <p><span>For example, in 1975 and 1976, German labor unions renounced wage hikes that would have increased the buying power of German workers.  Given the current rates of inflation, the decision represented a deterioration in labor's standard of living.  Commenting on this remarkable economic behavior, one German economist said, \"German labor unions see unemployment as the inevitable result of the international economic recession.  They accept the fact that in order to remain competitive in the international market, German firms must raise their productivity and this may easily mean a greater number of lay-offs.  German labor unions believe that in the long run, full employment will only be assured by a strong and healthy economy that is at once disciplined and competitive.  Given the difficult economic prospects we face today, strikes would only be counterproductive.</span></p> <p><span>Unemployment has not triggered social discontent in Germany.  Unemployment compensation is generous--a laid-off worker receives 58 per cent of his last net income for a year.  If he remains unemployed after this period, he goes on welfare and draws half of his former salary.</span></p> <p><span>West Germany can afford such generosity.  With inflation and unemployment under control, economic growth has upset all predictions and is currently surging ahead at a rate of 6 per cent.  This year's trade surplus promises to be the envy of every European finance ministry, and the mark is already the strongest currency in the Common Market.</span></p> <p><span>Gone are the days of German political timidity and self-doubt--a fact which both France and the Soviet Union find difficult to accept (see, for example, Michel Debre's recent article in Le Monde, \"Is Germany Becoming a Danger Again?\").  More assertive than his predecessors, Willy Brandt turned his back on twenty-five years of German guilt-ridden subservience, and pursued a vigorous Ostpolitik designed to reconcile West Germany with its Eastern neighbors and provide West German diplomacy with a greater freedom of maneuver.  Despite European fears that Brandt was about to engineer another Rapallo, and bitter domestic criticism that the Chancellor was conceding too much to the Soviets, Brandt was succesful in liquidating legal and territorial disputes that had poisoned relations with the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact countries for three decades.  In 1972, Bonn took the most difficult diplomatic step of it short career and recognized East Germany.  No longer a paralyzed hostage to French, Soviet, and American diplomacy, and reconciled to the division of Germany, Bonn began to defend its interests and objectives with a determination that would have been unthinkable a few years ago.</span></p> <p><span>Continuing the more independent and assertive diplomatic line laid down by his predecessor, Schmidt has not hesitated to mount the continental political stage.  Intelligent, forceful, and pragmatic, Schmidt has already become the leading European statesman.  Despite international mutterings of \"Iron Chancellor\" and the \"Germany of old,\" Schmidt has not hesitated to use German economic muscle to safeguard German interests.  He has warned the European Economic Community that Germany would no longer provide open ended funds to subsidize poorly conceived Community projects or stagnant, obsolete economic sectors of other countries.  \"Germany,\" according to Schmidt, \"will no longer be the 'milch cow' of the Community.\"  Further, Schmidt has made it clear to the Italian government that Germany would end all further economic aid to Italy if the Communists were allowed to come into the government.  Bonn sees no reason why it should subsidize a political movement that is anathema to the majority of Germans.  Pointing to his own pragmatic and successful policies, Schmidt has urged his partners to end their continuous domestic political maneuverings and address themselves to the urgent issues facing Western Europe today, namely economic recovery and European unity.</span></p> <p><span>If Schmidt has been successful in irritating each and all of his European partners, it should also be pointed out that European unity is a key concern of the Bonn government.  Many convinced Europeanists hoped that the growing entente between Giscard d'Estaing and Schmidt would give way to a discreet Franco-German directorate that would carry the idea of European unity beyond its present customs union status.  Unfortunately, Schmidt lost his partner less than six months ago.  Giscard d'Estaing's pro-European ideas were fiercely opposed by conservative Gaullists, ever so jealous of French sovereignty.  Depending on the Gaullists for a Parliamentary majority, and facing stiff opposition from the Left, Giscard was forced to mothball his call for a greater European commitment.</span></p> <p><span>Despite the numerous difficulties encountered along the way, Bonn continues to push for European unity.  European cooperation is unanimously supported by the German people.  Unlike France and Great Britain, the direct election of a European Parliament is not a controversial issue in Germany.  Most Germans would accept a reduction of national sovereignty if it would spur European integration.  Bonn considers the defense of German economic interests to be far more important than a French-style reaffirmation of national independence--a vague concept which has little meaning or support in the Germany of today.</span></p> <p><span>With 31 Soviet divisions on the German border, Bonn is understandably concerned with security.  Here, the vital German-American relationship has changed in style but not in substance.  Both Brandt and Schmidt have pursued policies more independent from Washington than either Adenauer or Erhard.  For example, harsh words were exchanged between Bonn and Washington during the 1973 Arab-Israeli conflict.  On the one had, Brandt was irritated by Washington's failure to consult its Allies during the conflict; on the other hand, Washington criticized West European refusal to provide the American airlift with logistical support.  Washington added that developments in the Middle East concerned the security of the Atlantic Alliance, and that the Europeans, certainly the Germans, should unquestioningly support United States policy there.</span></p> <p><span>Schmidt has struck an even more independent tone vis-a-vis Washington.  He has criticized the Ford's administration's conservative economic recovery programs for slowing down the pace of European economic recovery.  He has lectured President Ford on the need for arms standardisation on both sides of the Atlantic.  Germans arms procurement is no longer completely American-oriented and Schmidt was successful in renegotiating the financing of American troops in Germany on a more equitable basis.  There have also been serious differences between Bonn and Washington over nuclear proliferation.  Despite American criticism concerning the lack of adequate safeguards, Bonn is going ahead with its plans to sell nuclear technology to Brazil.  Bonn understands Washington's fear that nuclear by-products could be used to fabricate nuclear weapons, but it also sees no reason why it should abandon such a lucrative field to American competition.</span></p> <p><span>Beyond these differences of opinion, both Bonn and Washington agree that the ties between both countries have never been stronger.  Bonn remains firmly convinced that \"there is no European security without the United States.\"</span></p> <p><span>Having a large stake in the future of NATO and the Atlantic Alliance, Bonn has acted quickly to build up German military trength.  Today, Germany fields the largest army in Western Europe; 600,000 men strong, the Bundeswehr is well-trained and equipped with the latest in modern weaponry including tactical nuclear weapons (placed under American command-and-control procedures.)  Faithful to NATO defense guidelines, West Germany has become the privileged ally of the United States in the Atlantic Alliance.</span></p> <p><span>Despite Schmidt's political and economic successes in the international arena, he faces a stiff contest in the October political elections.  The popularity of the Social Democrats (SPD) is sagging and there is no hopes that they will be able to win a clear majority in the fall elections.  Worse, the Social Democrats have been weakened by internal dissension.  Schmidt has been hard-pressed to bring the rebellious left wing of the party under control.  The \"Jusos\" or Young Marxist hardly support Schmidt's policies and their vociferous demands for more widespread nationalization, more welfare programs, and bitter criticism of the way Bonn is handling the Baader-Meinhoff trial have antagonized SPD moderates and conservatives, and disturbed the German electorate.  Further, the right wing of the SPD is very unhappy with Willy Brandt.  The former Chancellor has supported the agitation of the Jusos against Schmidt and has given every impression that he would like to oust his successor from power.  Schmidt has attempted to quell the internal squabblings of the party but so far he has not been very successful.</span></p> <p><span>Schmidt's greatest electoral difficulty however will be to convince the FDP or Free Liberals to remain in the government coalition.  As in past elections, neither the Social Democrats nor the Christian Democrats led by Helmut Kohl will be able to win a clear electoral majority.  Consequently, the FDP which controls approximately 10 per cent of the vote will hold the balance of the elections.</span></p> <p><span>The main question facing the Free Liberals is whether they should remain in the seven-year-old coalition with the Social Democrats or whether they should bolt and form a profitable coalition with the Christian Democrats.  Politically and ideologically, the Free Liberals are closer to the Christian Democrats, but there have also been serious differences of opinion between the leaders of both parties, Schmidt and Hans-Dietrich Genscher (Foreign Affairs minister in the Bonn government).  Further, the Free Liberals could strengthen their political influence as the state (lander) level if they joined with the Christian Democrats.  In lander like Hesse and Rhine-Westphalia where the Free Liberals are in the minority, a coalition with the Christian Democrats would open the way for FDP administrative posts and increased political influence.  Needless to say, Genscher has used this tempting possibility to blackmail the Social Democrats for greater FDP influence in the government coalition.  Genscher's gamble may backfire, however.  Irritated by the FDP's maneuvers, Schmidt warned the Free Liberals that if they became too demanding, he would not exclude the possibility of forming a coalition with the Christian Democrats.</span></p> <p><span>Despite its economic power and political influence, West Germany continues to refuse the leadership of Western Europe.  \"That would be premature, if not impossible,\" a German diplomat said in a recent interview.  \"The German nation feels too vulnerable politically, militarily, and psychologically to accept such a difficult responsibility.  How can you expect us to assume a greater role in European affairs when we cannot even guarantee our own security?  The Soviets view the rise of our political and economic influence with great suspicion.  With 19,000 Warsaw Pact tanks stationed on our borders we cannot afford to become anything that would resemble the Germany of old.  The Soviets would never tolerate it.  Moreover, would Western Europe accept German leadership?  Three decades after WW II the German Federal Republic continues to bear the stigma of the Third Reich.  We have no political legitimacy:  every time Bonn refuses to revalue the mark to help out the French franc, French newspapers publish editorials about \"Iron Chancellors\" and \"German hegemony.\"  We are still a very controversial subject.</span></p> <p><span>\"Leadership may come in the future but for now let me say that the German people are happy not to be outcasts anymore, that they can call themselves Germans without bowing their heads in shame.  We have rebuilt our nation and we have taken our rightful place in the European community.  We are committed to democratic ideals, European unity, and the Atlantic Alliance.  We have come out of the desert.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "Soccer:  a cloudy picture | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The outlook for Harvard soccer this fall is, well, questionable.  Although there is some cause for optimism, \"questionable\" is the only realistic way to describe a team that has had varied success under George Ford's coaching the last two seasons.</span></p> <p><span>\"I'm pretty sure that this is the best team we've put on the field in three years,\" Ford says.  But his optimisism is muted:  \"Other teams, of course, are doing the same thing.\"</span></p> <p><span>Ford learned his lesson about optimism last season, when he held high hopes for the squad as the schedule began.  Eleven players, including big gun Lyman Bullard and senior co-captain fullbacks Geoff Hargadon and Ralph Booth, were returning from Ford's first-season team that placed second in the Ivies and made it to the NCAA playoffs.</span></p> <p><span>While the black thunderstorm that rained out the 1975 opener against pushover MIT may have been a harbinger of the flood that was to follow, Ford's spirits remained high.  \"We're farther along now than we were at this time last year,\" he said after a 3-0 opening victory over Wesleyan.</span></p> <p><span>Unpredictability set in after that, however, and the Crimson--despite Dave Acorn's scoring and Fred Herold's strong goaltending--played poorly.  By November, there were reports of dissatisfaction among the players with Ford's coaching.</span></p> <p><span>By the end of the season, the squad had turned it around to finish with a 6-6-1 overall record and a 4-3 Ivy mark to tie Dartmouth for third place behind Brown and Cornell.</span></p> <p><span>Bullard regained his scoring touch (he scored eight goals in 1974) as the team won three of its last four games, with the only loss coming at the hands of Brown, ranked third in the nation.</span></p> <p><span>This season Ford hopes to turn the tide as he did late in the 1975 season and make the Crimson predictable--as winners.  He unquestionably has the manpower to do it, with 13 lettermen returning.</span></p> <p><span>This is the final year to make good for the group of players who, as upstart sophomores in 1974, led Harvard to a 7-4-2 record and a berth in the NCAA regional playoffs.  Seniors Bullard (one co-captain), Acorn (the other), Chris Saunders, Eric Zager, Mike Lohrer and George Grassby have but one season left to prove that they are the stuff of champions.</span></p> <p><span>The proving will be made all the tougher by some key injuries during the team's training camp during early September at St. George's School in Newport, R.I. Lohrer, junior fullback Kevin Jiggetts, senior midfielder Harold Martin and sophomore forward Dave Eaton have all been sidelined with nagging injuries.  These injuries look like mere nosebleeds when compared to the temporary loss of Acorn to knee surgery he underwent during August.</span></p> <p><span>Playing striker, Acorn led the 1975 squad in both goals (10) and assists (4).  \"It's too bad,\" Ford says, \"because we were looking forward to Acorn and Bullard teaming up.  I hope Dave will be back some time in October.\"  Bullard and Acorn have combined for a total of 21 goals over the last two seasons, so the scoring burden will rest on Bullard for the first part of the season.</span></p> <p><span>There can be no doubting Bullard's explosive capability--as a sophomore, he scored eight goals during one four-game stretch.  \"Lyman is a good player going forward,\" Ford says.  \"We hope to open up some room for him.\"  Bullard will need some help on offense, though.  Lohrer and Dave Updike at the wings and Eric Zager on the inside will probably open the season on the front line, trying to open up some room for him.</span></p> <p><span>Matt Bowyer, a starter last year as a freshman, and Robbie McGee will back up the front line in Ford's 4-2-4 alignment.</span></p> <p><span>Spearheading Ford's diamond-shaped defense will be Saunders, who has been known in the past as much for his bullying tactics as for his athletic talent.  This year, Saunders seems to be in top form.  \"He really looks super this year,\" Ford says, \"and his shot looks tremendous, so he may play some offense.\"</span></p> <p><span>The responsibility for the defense rests with slightly built goalkeeper Fred Herold.  As a sophomore last year, Herold emerged from nowhere to stand out in the nets almost as much as his bright shock of red hair stands out in a crowd.  Herold registered an 83.7 per cent blocked shots average under often intense pressure last season.</span></p> <p><span>If Herold can get some help from his other fullbacks--right wing Kevin Jiggetts (a strong substitute last year), left wing Bob Carey, and sweeper Grassby (a converted striker)--the defense will be strong.  If he doesn't, it may be as porous as the Teton Dam.</span></p> <p><span>The league, as usual, is tough--\"probably the most competitive league in the country,\" according to Ford.  Brown returns a number of players from its 1975 NCAA consolation game winning team.  The Bruins, Ford says, should be a contender in the Ivy League and also in NCAA competition.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Cornell and Penn might be strong also,\" Ford adds.  Princeton and Dartmouth can never be written off either, and Yale and Columbia are usually respectable, if seldom good.</span></p> <p><span>The injuries, the tough league, the history of unpredictability:  all of these bode ill for the Crimson booters.  Ford is starting the year on an emphatic upbeat, though:  \"We might surprise a few people.  We're not picked to be strong and that's the way we like it--without pressure, but with dedication.\"</span></p> <p><span>Attitude problems that developed between Ford and his players last year have apparently disappeared.  Although senior Mark Zimering has not come out for the squad because of his disagreements with the coach, Ford says, \"The attitude has been tremendous.  We have 24 guys here with a great attitude and I'm looking forward to a real good year.\"</span></p> <p><span>Maybe the prognosis should be one of optimisism, then.  The goal is in good hands with the steady Herold.  There are no identifiable chinks in the Crimson's armor, either at offense, midfield or defense.  A lot of big names are returning.  Saunders. Bullard. Acorn. Bowyer. Jiggetts. Grassby.  The list goes on.</span></p> <p><span>The team certainly looks good on paper.  The game of soccer is played on grass, however, and pre-season outlooks have been erroneous in the past.  Last year's kick-and-run offense, for example, was expected to create a lot of exciting scoring opportunities.  While it did create many opportunities, the goals did not begin to click until late in the season.</span></p> <p><span>The overall outlook, in short, is uncertain, but somewhat on the positive side.  This may be the year that Harvard soccer recreates its glory days of the early '70s and challenges strongly for the Ivy crown.  But don't be surprised if the sky over the Business School soccer field is ominously cloudy--as it was for last September's opener versus MIT--when the Crimson plays its opening game this year.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Rocky and His Friends | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b>T NOW LOOKS as if the election year will be bland, but you couldn't have guessed that last fall.  At that time, it seemed as if the 1976 presidential election might pit Nelson Rockefeller against Hubert Humphrey, a struggle that could only have been designed by the collaborating imaginations of R. Crumb and Karl Marx.  \"Big Capital squares off against Big Labor in a duel to the death!  The executive committee of the bourgeoisie casts off the hypocritical veil of congressional government and campaigns in its own name, while the section of the labor movement which has reached only trade union consciousness presses for its share of the surplus!  The boff 'em, sock 'em bout of the century!\"</span></p> <p><span>Of course, things haven't worked out that way.  Humphrey, in his exuberance, sabotaged hit-man Scoop Jackson in Pennsylvania, which, as it turns out, was the last place rival Democrats could have stopped Carter.  And the scenario that could have allowed for a Rockefeller candidacy--a series of Ford defeats by Reagan in the early primaries, knocking the incumbent out, thereby legitimizing Rockefeller's entry--never materialized.</span></p> <p><span>Michael Kramer and Sam Robert's new book doesn't cover much new ground, tending to concentrate on events which are already public knowledge.  The authors focus on the specific role of Rockefeller in those incidents through interviews with his aides and enemies and through a commendably exhaustive investigation into the public record.  The result is a highly readable, entertaining acount of his political career.</span></p> <p><span>However, the book fails to provide some sort of understanding about what was going on within the Republican Party during the 1960s.  Rockefeller often says that if he had been a Democrat, he would've been president long ago.  This claim is an overstatement.  Within the scope of his own career Rockefeller has demonstrated such consistent insensitivity to the mood of the national electorate that it is unlikely he could have succeeded with any party.  But it's also true that a shift took place within the GOP; power was moving to the string of Southern and Western states that constitute the sunbelt.  That area was the main beneficiary of the post-WW II boom, still unhibited by the countervailing force of strong trade-unionism.  Rockefeller stumbled upon this split by accident, purely out of his search for a political base.  But he came down on the wrong side of it and thereby alienated a segment of the GOP capable of denying him the nomination forever.</span></p> <p><span>There was no doubt from the beginning of Rockefeller's career in 1958 as to his final goal.  As he himself put it before the '64 campaign, \"I'm a politician.  That is my profession.  Success in politics, real success, means only one thing in America.\"  The prevalent wisdom in that first gubernatorial campaign in 1958 against Averill Harriman was that Rockefeller had only gained his family's approval for his venture into politics on the condition that he would be in the White House within ten years.</span></p> <p><span>Rockefeller gained the Republican nomination for governor with his favorite device--polls.  His showed that he ran best among possible GOP candidates against Harriman, though he would lose heavily too, and therefore the nomination was hardly anything worth fighting for.  In this way he whittled down the opposition of the state's powerful Republicans like Thomas Dewey who were suspicious of his ambition and his money.  The contest of 1958 presented the ideal face for him; against Harriman, the Union Pacific heir, the issue of personal fortune was relatively muted.  Rockefeller won by more than half a million votes, outspending Harriman by a bout that many dollars in that Battle of the Millionaires.</span></p> <p><span>In his 1960 non-campaign for the presidency, Rockefeller demonstrated an insensitivity to the GOP establishment, that, while only mildly harmful then, would prove fatal to his political life four years later.  He roamed around the world with little on his mind but fallout radiation (Nehru would remark later, \"...a very strange man...all he wants to talk about is bomb shelters\"), an issue which carried the implication that Eisenhower had been soft with the Russians.  He entered the campaign an outsider and left a bad loser--in his final declaration of non-candidacy, Rockefeller avoided endorsing the only serious candidate left in the field, Richard Nixon.  In the minds of GOP pros, Rockefeller was forever marked as a man whose personal ambition took precedence over party unity.</span></p> <p><span>In 1962, after re-election over a weak opponent, Rockefeller seemed to have a lock on the upcoming presidential nomination of his party for president.  In preparation, he sought to refurbish his image a conservative, accusing President Kennedy of appeasing the Russians by not allowing Cuban exiles to stage raids against Castro.  The polls showed Rockefeller the favorite among Republicans over Goldwater by a margin of 43 to 26 per cent.  Only an act of incredible naivete could stop him.  Rockefeller provided it by marrying Happy Murphy, fast upon the heels of his divorce from Mary Todhunter Clark.  Virtually overnight his lead over Goldwater reversed itself; Goldwater now led him in the polls by 40 to 29 per cent.</span></p> <p><span>Rockefeller was stunned, apparently having been caught completely off-guard by the public reaction.  He needed a new issue now to get himself back into the race.  He discovered this issue in the \"radical right\" of the Republican Party, which he denounced vociferously in his Bastile Day Declaration of July 14, 1963.  His move was perceived as too bold, too divisive even in the moderate ranks of the party--Eisenhower, Nixon, George Romney and William Scranton all disassociated themselves from his position.</span></p> <p><span>If Rockefeller had kept his mouth shut, he might very well have won the nomination despite the remarriage.  The Kennedy assassination and the emergence of Lyndon Johnson seemed to negate the possibilities of success for Goldwater's southern strategy.  As it was, the moderates had no candidate who could present himself as a unifier, and besides, Rockefeller's initial salvo had been returned with vengeance by the Goldwater faction, culminating in a 15-minute round of boos for him at the Cow Palace.</span></p> <p><span>Nixon observed the workings of that convention closely and came out of it understanding what he'd have to do and whom he had to court to get the nomination in four years.  He spent the intervening time campaigning for local Republican candidates, particularly in the sunbelt, picking up IOU's wherever he went.  So when Rockefeller emerged with his inevitable polls showing him beating Johnson in '68, it hardly mattered--Nixon had the GOP county chairmen.  Rockefeller tried to offset Nixon's advantage with a $4.6 million media blitz and a new set of polls.  But after the assassination of Robert Kennedy it was too late--Nixon had run in the primaries, and Rockefeller was trying to run in thepolls.  The party leaders resented it.</span></p> <p><span>That debacle probably convinced Rockefeller that there was no future in Eastern Establishment positions.  Rockefeller has compensated with a vengeance for his earlier heresies, breathing reactionary rhetoric with the worst of them.  He pushed through a one-year residency rule for welfare recipients in 1970, bragging later that \"I decided to get the cheats and chiselers off the taxpayers' back.\"  This action was followed by repressive (and ineffective) mandatory sentencing measures for drug dealers and users, as well as the Attica murders.</span></p> <p><span>Nothing helped though.  Rockefeller remained anathema to Republicans from Florida to California.  A visit of the \"new\" Rockefeller to the Mississippi GOP served to change its burning hatred for him into hatred.</span></p> <p><span>Nor would his conversion to conservatism ever be totally convincing because of the structural demands of the governorship of New York.  His effectiveness there depended on his ability to get along with the state's labor leaders, precipitating such moves as his refusal to call out the National Guard during the 1967 garbage strike in New York City.  And in order to guarantee re-election in 1970 in his overwhelmingly Democratic state, Rockefeller was forced to take liberal positions on abortion, the 18-year-old vote, and mass transit.</span></p> <p><span>Kramer and Roberts are at their best when describing the way in which Rockefeller made New York work for him, his forte.  The reader senses in their attitude towards him a cynicism bordering on awe, at his ability to terrify, dispence patronage, impress, and when necessary, buy outright, whatever and whomever he wanted in the state.  Strangely, it was these very qualities that prevented him from getting the only thing he really wanted.  Given the changing character of the Republican Party, winning it would have required a humility and sensitivity that it is perhaps unreasonable to expect from a Rockefeller.</span></p>"}
{"title": "\"...a bomb went off in the john\" | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b>N THE SPRING of 1972 I spent a day with Sen. Walter Mondale (D.-Minn.) in Washington, D.C., as one of two delegates from Minnesota to the United States Senate Youth Program.  Sponsored by the Hearst Foundation, the program was established in the hope that first-hand exposure to the federal government would nudge student leaders into the political profession.</span></p> <p><span>A week of touring the capital's historical sites and sitting through speeches by prominent pols (including then Rep. Gerald R. Ford (R.-Mich.)) with a day following our senators around the Hill.  Since Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey (D.-Minn.) was away campaigning for the presidency, both Minnesota delegates were pawned off on the senior \"Gopher State\" senator, \"Fritz\" Mondale, who took on the tour-guide task with an amiability that eased our initial disappointment at the legendary HHH's absence.</span></p> <p><span>Mondale greeted us in his office and immediately led us to the Senate dining room for lunch.  Mondale was chewing gum; that's not what the civics books say senators do, but it's typically Mondale--easy going, personable, possessed by an athletic warmth.</span></p> <p><span>At lunch, Mondale called our waitress by her first name.  His naturalness plus the arrangement of the small tables gave the room a homey kitchen atmosphere, though a portion of the back wall was missing.  Sipping soup from his spoon, Mondale explained:  \"...a bomb went off in the john.\"  What I took as a joke, it turned out later, was actually true.</span></p> <p><span>During the 20-minute meal we talked about many different things, Mondale speaking with typical senatorial dispatch, my fellow delegate abnormally reticent out of the same nervousness that made me unusually talkative.  We told him how the Mississippi delegates' high image of their senator, James O. Eastland (D.-Miss.) was dashed.  Eastland had been talking on the phone behind a cloud of cigar smoke when the two arrived in his office.  He motioned to them to sit down, saying \"Be with you in a minute boys.\"  And then, after hanging up the phone, an explanation:  \"Sorry for making you boys wait.  That was the television people.  They want me to go on T.V. but you know damn well all they want to talk about is niggers, the nigger problem...Well, I guess we're always gonna have a nigger problem, boys.\"</span></p> <p><span>Without breaking the rhythm of his chewing, Mondale reacted:  \"That doesn't surprise me.\"</span></p> <p><span>My fellow delegate, a parochial school graduate from Duluth, gave me several disapproving glances as we ate.  Perhaps what we were discussing wasn't proper in the Senate dining hall, but Mondale seemed eager to entertain questions.  In fact, anytime there was a silence he would ask us a question.</span></p> <p><span>\"What do you think of the men who've spoken to your group?  Who's talked to you?\"</span></p> <p><span>We told him we had met with Justice Harry Blackmun of the Supreme Court, a Minnesotan.  \"Yes, he's a good man,\" Mondale responded.</span></p> <p><span>We confided in him that Attorney General John Mitchell had seemed curt, bothered and even hostile when answering our questions.  Mondale inquired further:  \"Was he?  Yes, things are tense right now.  What did he say?\"  Not much, we told the senator; the attorney general mostly avoided saying anything and eventually stormed off flanked by two hulking, frowning guys in gray suits.</span></p> <p><span>Mondale told us that the general feeling in Washington was \"very bad,\" that things were wrong \"in a big way\" and that even though he was very close to some of his colleagues, strong political factions were being formed and sides were being taken.  I wasn't sure what he meant, but his sincere, assured manner dissuaded me from following up the statement--as did the nervous glance issued by the Duluth delegate, who eased off the potentially grave turn by asking Mondale who in the Senate shared most of his political views.</span></p> <p><span>\"Kennedy.  There are only seven or eight real liberals in the Senate.  Me, Kennedy, Humphrey, and a few others.\"  McGovern?  we asked.  \"Yeah.  McGovern too.  And [Sen. Mike] Gravel [D.-Alaska].  But the country is very conservative right now.  Don't you think so?\"  Who did he think would win the Democratic nomination for president in 1972, we asked.  \"Senator Humphrey, I hope.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>S</b>EVERAL MONTHS LATER, I saw Sen. Mondale at the convention of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL) in Rochester, Minnesota.  He was on his way to the podium to ask for an endorsement for re-election which he would receive handily.  Presidential candidate Humphrey was not so lucky.  In his home state he received barely 51 per cent of the delegates headed to Miami, compared with 49 per cent committed to a liberal coalition of Chisholm-Lindsay-McCarthy-McGovern.  Differences over the war, amnesty, gay rights, marijuana, abortion and a dozen other issues left the DFL with an unfortunate pattern of internal rifts that would be repeated nationally.</span></p> <p><span>\"Senator, how are you?  Do you remember me?\"  I asked.</span></p> <p><span>He looked at my delegate badge, which carried my name.</span></p> <p><span>\"I remember the face, but not the name,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>\"I want you to know that I'm working on your campaign.\"  He answered:  \"Thank you.  Senate Youth Program, right?\"  And he was gone.</span></p> <p><span>The next time I saw Mondale he was standing in front of a television camera at the 1972 National Democratic Convention.  McGovern had locked up the nomination, and Humphrey had his arm around \"Fritz\" recommending him as a future leader of national stature to Walter Cronkite and the nation.  As Humphrey spoke, Mondale stood there quietly, somber and earnest.</span></p> <p><span>Throughout the next four years I carefully followed Mondale's voting record and career as a senator.  When he announced his decision not to seek the presidency in 1976 I was disappointed but respected his priorities.  This past April, while visiting Minneapolis for a job interview, I saw him in the Leamington Hotel downtown.  He was greeting florists on their way to a convention in one of the ballrooms.  He was in the center of the hotel lobby, smiling, still chewing gum.</span></p> <p><span>I waited my turn, then...</span></p> <p><span>\"Senator, you probably don't remember me but four years ago I spent a day with you as a delegate to the U.S. Senate Youth Program,\" I said.</span></p> <p><span>\"Oh, yeah, that Hearst thing.  That's a good program.  What're you doing now?\"</span></p> <p><span>\"I graduate from Harvard in June.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Good for you.  Then what?\"</span></p> <p><span>I almost said \"good question,\" but instead... \"I'm not sure, I hope to work for Senator Frank Church's campaign.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Yes, he's a good man.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Unless...are you going to run for President, Senator?\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Who me?  Oh, God, oh no, oh God no!\"  He was slightly amused.</span></p> <p><span>\"There's a leadership vacuum in this country, sir.\"  I volunteered.</span></p> <p><span>\"Yes, I know, isn't it terrible?\"</span></p>"}

In his soft southern drawl he told how his daddy taught him to play and sing, and how it was time for us to get back together again, and about his Christian faith and his little daughter in the 60 per cent black school...</span></p> <p><span>The crowd stood transfixed.

When that didn't work, he tried another tune.  \"The Panama Canal will always be ours,\" he declared.

{"title": "The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Liberals and \"progressives\" trying to reconcile themselves to Jimmy Carter should stay away from the July/August issue of the Columbia Journalism Review.  Phil Stanford's analysis on the press coverage of the Democratic candidate (\" 'The most remarkable piece of fiction' Jimmy Carter ever read\") contains some unsettling tidbits about the former governor of Georgia.</span></p> <p><span>Take, for example, the Carter campaign brochure that claims Carter's reorganization of Georgia's state government \"slashed administrative costs by 50 per cent\" and left a surplus of about $116 million.  Well, Stanford quotes Carter's news director admitting that no statistics are available to substantiate the 50 per cent claim.</span></p> <p><span>As for the $116 million surplus, Stanford writes:  \"Carter did indeed leave office with a surplus of $116 million--$13 million more than when he took office.\"  And during Carter's term in office, the state debt increased $205 million.</span></p> <p><span>Then there's the Carter letter found by Steven Brill, author of \"Jimmy Carter's Pathetic Lies,\" to a Mrs. Dempsey in Alabama, saying \"I think you will find that... George Wallace and I are in agreement on most issues.\"  In his response to the Brill piece, Jody Powell, Carter's press secretary, wrote that the letter \"was written by a staffer, never seen by Governor Carter, and did not accurately express his views.\"</span></p> <p><span>But Stanford notes that a reporter from The Miami Herald later found that the unnamed staffer who authored the letter was none other than Powell himself.</span></p> <p><span>There are a lot more unanswered questions--about Carter's tactics during his 1970 gubernatorial campaign; about Carter's 1972 speech at a \"George Wallace Appreciation Day,\" the proceeds of which went to Wallace's presidential campaign; and about Carter's failure to reveal the names of contributors to his 1970 campaign.  Not to mention some insightful words on why the studies of Carter done so far--like Brill's--have failed to have any measurable impact on Carter's success.</span></p> <p><span>This may all seem like water under the proverbial bridge.  But don't forget that the Republicans are spending thousands of dollars on negative research about Carter and that Jerry Brown's success in the final primaries might indicate a growing backlash against Carter's fuzziness on the issues and his own past.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Part of the Way with Jimmy | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>E</b>VEN IN PLATITUDE and papered-over unity, it's hard to hate the Democrats.  They remind you of a doddering old, favorite grandmother, slightly out of step with the times, forcing the same old remedies on you--in this case, public works to insure full employment, more social services tied to increased government efficiency (this year's cliche, but remember that FDR promised to balance the budget), and the achievement of the American dream for all within the next Carter administration.  We shouldn't be too cynical, though.  The old girl has heart, her mistakes nothing more than the shortcomings of her nation's people:  too much faith in their ability to tinker with an economy which really should be restructured to face a reality of monopoly corporate power; belief that supersession of the \"special interests\" will be a matter of Ralph Nader-type government regulation; and that all we need is an honest man to lead us in sacrifice and renewal of our pioneer toughness.</span></p> <p><span>Next to that, the Republicans are a low, base, scary spectre.  Hunter Thompson, writing about Nixon's last campaign, said that Republican victory rests on the assumption that the United States is a land of 215 million used car salesmen--that we should respond to our poor people and the world's underprivileged in a spirit of paranoia, that we ought to shoot first and ask questions later, that free enterprise somehow means huge government subsidies to corporations with too much decision-making power over the kind of work we do and the kinds of dreams we have.  It's ironic to the point of national neurosis that the most extreme of the Republicans, the self-dubbed part of capitalist \"freedom,\" should represent near-fascism; and that the Democrats, often described by the Right as creepingly socialistic and thus, totalitarian, should have <i>Its</i> trust-busting extremists favoring somehing like a small-scale competitive economy and society.</span></p> <p><span>Political correspondents from The New York Times, The Boston Globe, NBC News, ad infinitum, are delivering a conventional wisdom that the Democrats latest convention is evidence of a return to conservative sanity after the ideological rending of 1968 and 1972.  Martin Nolan, one of the best of Washington columnists, compares the McGovern and Carter installations as a constrast between a Rotary convention and Woodstock nation.  This viewpoint implies that the Democrats have gone back to being something akin to the Christian Democrats of Italy--a permanent majority party dedicated to winning elections and dispensing patronage, oblivious to broader issues since the American electorate is itself \"non-ideological.\"  The foregoing opinion has the virtue of being comfortable:  it tells people like my father, a liberal man who's voted for Roosevelt four times, Trumanonce, Stevenson twice.  Kennedy, Johnson and Humphrey (and wishes he'd voted for McGovern) that the world's oldest, continuous political party is still pretty much the same.  Not too much will be different with Jimmy Carter as president and the Democrats retaining their nearly two-thirds congressional majority, the experts imply.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HAT DOESN'T SEEM ALTOGETHER right to me.  Look at the platform, written by Carter's people and approved by the candidate.  It commits the nation to a foreign policy more progressive than anything seen since the international popular front of democratic forces in World War II.  It says that we can no longer intervene to preserve the status quo in most of the world where, as Frank Church put it, there is no status quo; that means in Angola, Chile, and Indochina.  Charter's closest advisers of foreign affairs, like Zbigniew Brzezinski and George Ball, point to the primacy of our alliance with the Social Democratic states of Western Europe, all of whom had better stands than the Nixon-Kissinger-Ford axis on Spain, Portugal and Italy, as well as the third world.  The \"European alliance,\" stressed at the expense of U.S. Soviet relations, means the diminution of tit-for-tat negotiating with the Soviets, lessening the chance of nuclear war growing out of quarrels like those which recently brewed over southern Africa.  We can also expect more support from a Carter administration for majority rule in that area--not least because black Americans were Carter's earliest and most loyal supporters in the primaries.</span></p> <p><span>On school busing, on abortion, on welfare, and employment programs, the Democratic platform will be far more progressive than the Republicans, though don't believe for a second that the conservative wing of the party hasn't exacted its price.  To hold his power base in Texas and the oil producing states in general, Carter has not revealed his position on oil monopolies and the need for a national energy corporation.  Nor has he really addressed the problem of deregulation of natural gas prices, for the same reason.  His other deplorably weak stand is on national defense, where clowns like Admiral Elmo Zumwalt have way too much influence with him.  A $5.7 billion defense cut isn't much, especially compared to what McGovern people were talking about four years ago.  But the faction embracing Sen. Henry Jackson is still in the party, as Moynihan's apparently popular candidacy attests, and the uneasy coalition of social forces that the Democrats represents will remain in tension at least through November 2.</span></p> <p><span><b>S</b>O, THE DEMOCRATIC convention was not so much a repudiation of 1972's majority and the Chicago convention's large minority as it was a consolidation of certain gains, the greatest of them in the international policy sphere.  The Democratic party can now go only so far rightward and still maintain itself, the Democratic left having formed during the struggles against the Viet Nam war and currently composing from a third to a half of the party.</span></p> <p><span>In a related way, the latest primary campaign and convention--for all the latter's stability, widely mistaken for conservatism--continued a gradual power shift of some importance, masked by the \"good government\" rhetorical appeal of Carter, who all along has sought support on the basis of his personal qualities rather than issues.  The old AFLCIO labor bosses are on the outs, having supported Jackson; and the more liberal union leaderships, like those of the Auto Workers, State, County and Municipal workers, National Education Association, and the coal miners, have grown in power, having backed Carter and at least partially responsible for his victories in Iowa, Florida and Michigan.</span></p> <p><span>The latter group, as The New York Times reported yesterday, was more numerous at the convention just ended.  And in its eschewal of New Deal reformism (which always comes from on top, and protects corporate control), and its willingness to at least consider options like workers' say in managing production, they form the nucleus of what the Democrats could perhaps come to be:  a social democratic labor party of the European type.  But the Democrats are possibly more alive than those relics:  they contain a cross-section of the nation, have little real opposition to their left, and the Democratic progressives' long exile in the opposition has made them a bit more skeptical of pure welfare-statism than its European counterparts.</span></p> <p><span><b>Q</b>UALIFIED support for Carter-Mondale and the Democrats seems in order, then, particularly if the Right's candidate is Reagan or if a race against Ford looks close come late October.  The Democrats put Cezar Chavez up there, and I saw as many women as men on the platform and almost as many on the convention floor; there were also enough black people on hand so Madison Square Garden didn't resemble a Brigham Young University pep rally, like the Republicans in Kansas City undoubtedly will.  The potential mass left-wing in America is with the Democrats now--the huge number of working people with everyday worries about family and money and being taken advantage of by the \"special interest\" hucksters and their men like Reagan and Connally.  And we too should be part of the way with the Democrats.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Winners and Losers in New York | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Representative John Conyers, a liberal from Michigan, was on the prowl.  He was looking for liberal delegates to sign a petition for Representative Ron Dellums' vice presidential candidacy, and when he sauntered into the Americans for Democratic Action cocktail party last Wednesday, he figured he could gather all the signatures he needed.  A rude awakening followed.</span></p> <p><span>\"How many delegates are here?\"  the banlon-shirted Conyers asked as he walked into the fairly crowded ADA suite.  After a second of counting, a surprised Conyers exclaimed, \"Only three delegates in the whole goddamned hall.\"  It's true, the ADA, institutionalized liberalism at its best, had attracted only three members of the party's power structure.  That's something that would have been unheard of one or two conventions ago.  And despite the protestations of ADA members attending, the handful of delegates was a sign that the liberals lived in the closet, if at all, during the '76 convention.</span></p> <p><span>Like Conyers, I came to the ADA meeting in search of liberals, wondering about their demise, and trying to pin down a thesis that they were the big losers at Convention '76.  And as with Conyers, it didn't take me long to realize that the liberals were indeed on the run.</span></p> <p><span>When I spoke to Conyers, he was even more pessimistic.  \"There is no spokesman for the left this year, other than Dellums,\" Conyers said, adding that he doesn't know where Carter stands--although he is sure that Carter is not a liberal.</span></p> <p><span>Russell Hay, a Carter delegate from Pennsylvania relaxed with a drink in hand at the ADA's fund-raiser.  He was tired, but more than willing to talk about the process of liberal accommodation, and the small role that liberals apparently played at the convention.  \"Those big liberal issues are done, they are accomplished.  There are no problems with sex, with color,\" he says.  Hay, who hails from Pennsylvania Dutch country, said he had talked about the liberal absence with his delegations, and many agreed that \"we are seeing the fruits of the McGovern push in 1972.  The party has realized that you'd better open up or you don't exist.\"  Into that vacuum of battles won stepped Carter, and like many liberals of Hay's nature, he says, \"Carter?  He's not bad.\"</span></p> <p><span>Rep. Jonathan Bingham represented another strain of liberals in the ADA's suite, the Udall supporters.  He admitted that he was skeptical of Carter, but that he was an acceptable alternative to the Nixon-Ford politicians, especially if he picked a liberal like Mondale for vice president.  Nevertheless, Bingham says he can't feel strongly about the man.</span></p> <p><span>How representative a feeling is Bingham's?  The Democrats made an impressive show of unity, as everyone now knows.  But, much of that unity was easily whipped up out of the intense anti-Nixon-Ford feeling that still burns in the delegates' hearts.  The fervor wasn't really Carter-inspired.  In fact, it appeared to me that Carter's support outside the south seemed very soft.  Soft is a word without precision, and may not tell much in terms of electoral votes.  But what it can indicate is the percentage of voter turnout--something very important to a majority that has a front runner.  Softness does translate into a large percentage of voters, maybe down to something like 52 per cent especially in the North and West, which could really hurt Carter's chances in November.</span></p> <p><span>Part of the reason why I sense that the Carter support seemed weak was the lack of a turnout on the early nights of the convention.  On Tuesday night the platform readings clashed head-on with the All-Star Game in nearby Philadelphia, and the game won handsdown.  In at least two large delegations, the Ohio and Pennsylvania contingents, there were more empty seats than full ones at times--possibly because Ohio (Cincinnati Reds) and Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh Pirates and Philadelphia Phillies) had so many representatives.  Don't laugh.  \"That's not a dubious thesis at all,\" Richard Celeste, Lt. Governor of Ohio, said in corroboration.  \"There were a lot of seats and a lot of people went down to the game.\"</span></p> <p><span>Another anti-Carter illusion may have been created by the large blocs of Udall supporters--mostly from fashionable portions of New York and Westchester, that packed the galleries.  Silence came from the rafters at times when you would have expected wild support for Carter--support that would have been expressed, say, if the convention had been held in a Southern city.</span></p> <p><span>Exactly how boring the convention really was, is still an issue.  Bob Marzell, a tenor saxophonist in Peter Duchin's band had just finished about his 15th round of \"Happy Days Are Here Again,\" and yet he was still willing to compare the event favorably to some bar mitzvahs and other affairs he's been playing lately.  \"It's exciting to see the VIPs,\" he said.  Madison Square Garden President Michael Burke, however, the man best suited to compare this event to others at the arena, admitted that a Knicks game would have created a more enthusiastic crowd.  Spotted Wednesday night in the highest bleachers, Burke said, \"it's boring,\" while surveying the happiness downstairs.</span></p> <p><span>* * *</span></p> <p><span>If the liberals as a group seemed less likely to be the cornerstone in Carter's wall of Democratic unity, the black delegates just may play that role.  The black caucus met for much of Wednesday, and presented its findings at a press conference that afternoon.  Reporters during and after the conference saw a group of delegates that was definitely Carterized both on and off the record.  The accent of the meeting was that Basil Patterson, chairman of the caucus, said his delegation didn't want to push for a black vice presidential nominee, because it didn't want to give false hopes to black people.  But what came through in the conference was the sincere belief on the part of the caucus that Carter would appoint far greater proportions of blacks into his administration than previous presidents in past administrations.  Part of the reason for the sincerity is that both Carter and the caucus are playing ball with each other.  The black delegation had the numbers and the chance to heavily endorse Dellums or the popular Barbara Jordan for vice president.  Such nomination fights would have caused a disruption that would have made the delegates more visible.  But they chose to lay low because they could exercise far more power by lobbying with Carter for what they wanted for both the v.p. slot and the platform.  That they did the former is obvious.  The cooperation on the platform, which Carter sanctioned, is not as easily seen.  But a scrutiny of key issues in the platform, especially when compared to the positions adopted at the black caucus in May of this year shows that blacks incorporated their positions almost wholly unchanged.</span></p> <p><span>A few examples show that blacks were indeed the big gainers in New York.  The issue of full employment is the highest priority of both the caucus of black Democrats and the party.  Both positions call for a Marshall plan for the cities and direct federal subsidies for lower-income housing.  The National Health Care plan endorsed by the Democrats includes most of the specifics of the black delegates caucus's agenda including comprehensive coverage with special mention of mental health and employer-employee payroll tax finances.  There is strong support for affirmative action and the platform calls for the declaration of Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday as a national holiday.</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps most interestingly, the platform specifically calls for the end to the relaxation of the arms embargo against South Africa and prohibits the granting of U.S. tax credits for companies doing business in Namibia and paying taxes to South Africa.  And it calls for the repeal of the Byrd Amendment which permits the importation of Rhodesian chrome.  I asked Rep.  Shirley Chisholm if she believes that Jimmy Carter would live up to the party platform principles on Africa.  She said she believes he very clearly embraces these principles, and that no president has ever done as much as Jimmy Carter will do for blacks in Africa.  She was thoroughly Carterized.</span></p> <p><span>Not all women were as satisfied.  The women in the National Organization for Women caucus said they are unhappy with Carter and the Democratic party.  The women in the NOW caucus said they were dissatisfied that the full-employment plank of the platform failed to speak specifically about the problems of women.  They also disliked the compromise for future conventions that encouraged delegations to promote and not require that 50 per cent of the delegates be women.</span></p> <p><span>Rep. Elizabeth Holtzman '62 from New York, however, disagreed with women who objected to the platform.  She cited ample provision for day care centers in the platform, and didn't feel in general that women's issues were left out.  She said she believes that it really doesn't matter how you state that you want delegations to act affirmatively.  the most important consideration, she said, is the people administering the rules.  \"Even the clearest law won't be fully upheld,\" she snorted, if the people in charge of making affirmative action happen are prejudiced against women.</span></p> <p><span>Albert Friedman, a Hasidic delegate from New York, said he speaks for some at the convention when he says that talk of requiring a certain percentage of women smacks of a quota system.  He is opposed to quotas in any form, he adds.</span></p> <p><span>Whatever the consequences of the promote vs. require debate, John Kenneth Galbraith, professor Emeritus, said he believes that women and young people have made permanent inroads in the party structure because of a series of campaign reforms.  The primary system in particular, he said, has done away with many professional politicians, because the system encourages candidates to commit themselves early, something they don't like to do.  He said he would be surprised if many people at the convention were here for the first time.  \"There is a very low proportion of professionals here,\" he said.  \"There is no better way to open the convention to youths than the primary system, which is something that The Harvard Crimson approves of.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "A Worm in the Garden | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>A</b> COUPLE OF THINGS need to be said about the college press at last week's Democratic Convention.  One point is obvious; the Democratic National Committee did not want us there.  My first realization of our second-class stature came when I picked up my credentials at the Statler Hilton, across the street from the Garden.  I was told beforehand by mimeographed letter that I was to be part of the \"special press\" gallery, but given no further inkling to the particulars of my status.  But while I was stepping out of the elevator I spotted a magic-markered poster tacked on the wall:  \"weeklies, college press, foreign broadcasters, this way.\"  O.K., so I was lumped with the weeklies, but foreign broadcasters?  An image of the Zoo Plane filled with technicians and foreign newsmen, described in <i>Boys on the Bus,</i> shot through my mind.  Trouble.</span></p> <p><span>But, no matter, they still gave me credentials.  When I walked out of the room with my pinkcolored \"news\" tag dangling from my neck, I felt smug.  But my confidence was jolted when I got back in the elevator.  I was surrounded by a group of newsmen with <i>orange</i> tags, and New York Times picture i.d.'s.  A caste system was developing.  It wasn't until I was standing in an endless line with the rest of the \"special\" press for my pass to the floor in the $6.50 bleacher section--where no self-respecting Knicks fan would tread for free--that I realized they wanted the college press to cover the event from the television.</span></p> <p><span>They stacked us up behind the podium, with only some close-circuit apparatus as a window to the festivities.  The tube was poorly placed; one well-situated fat man could wipe out 200 newspapers' visibility of the events on the floor.  A pink tag, you see, only guaranteed you a ticket to wait in line for a pass to get on the floor.  There were only 25 passes for all of us.  A pass allowed you 20 minutes on the floor.  As soon as your time was up you got back in line and waited for an hour or an hour and a half until your turn came again.  Once you had your shot you consigned yourself to the bleachers and passed time with the monitor and reporters from WBUR and the Chelsea Clinton news before you could reach the floor for a second time.  Once given the baton you'd try to run past the crowds, but it took five minutes to get to the floor.  There was a great temptation not to return the pass.  But two things, the rumor that Washington columnist Barbara Howar had been evicted from the convention for staying out an hour-and-a-half on her floor pass, and the DNC staffers' sheer meanness when they greeted you if you returned even a few minutes late, were strong deterrents.  Those with orange passes had a much sweeter deal.  They had far more passes to rotate among themselves, and could get to the floor much easier.</span></p> <p><span>The pink pass did allow us to circle a \"news-perimeter\" above the level in the Garden where the alternates sat.  Simply to get into the convention you would first be checked by about 20 different security people including several cops outside the Garden, DNC people and ushers at all seven levels of escalators, and the secret service and more DNC flunkies inside the hall.  The guards at the alternate level were instructed to look out for pink newsmen descending.  Few, even reporters with friends among the patronage-holders, could maneuver past the perimeter wall.  While waiting you could drum up some interesting slice-of-life stories by roaming the balconies.  But after a while the value of those \"mood of Democratic America as seen through the loge section of Madison Square Garden\" pieces starts to wane.  Of course, there is some truth to the argument that policy-making is conducted strictly in the dingy rooms in the adjacent Statler.  But the policy makers have never been known to let reporters into their private sessions.  A reporter's life and death at a convention revolves around his ability to get to the floor.</span></p> <p><span>Because of the restrictions many of the reporters from the special section took to doing some T.V. reporting.  Maybe that's alright.  After all, for 361 days of the year T.V. people get most of their stories through newspapers.  For four days newspapermen can surrender their primacy.  It's really their event.  And they are well-prepared.  Five minutes with NBC's John Hart convinced me of that.  I once saw Hart mutter to someone on the floor that he wished he knew more about the party's defense plank.  But two minutes later he was stumping Admiral Zumwalt, the party spokesman on defense, with some tough questions about the party's stand.</span></p> <p><span>Unless you were on the floor it was impossible to tell how real the sentiment for unity was.  Only through mingling with delegations could you tell that the snowballing unity wasn't something that Carter's efficiency experts decided to manufacture.  Nevertheless, ten seconds of every minute on the floor was spent gazing at the clock above the NBC booth.  And it is difficult to tell Pennsylvania's governor that you must excuse yourself because you have Cinderella status.</span></p> <p><span>That wasn't the end of the humiliation.  The most embarassing moment for me came when I tried to make an appointment with Elizabeth Holtzman, a representative from New York and a Harvard overseer.  I called her office from a pay phone in the Statler.  An appointments secretary asked me for a number where she could reach me.  I hung up and broke for the convention floor.  I made my way past the guards to a row of phones under the Milwaukee Journal banner.  I called back and left the Journal's number.  There were a few harried moments and then a light on the side of the phone began to blink.  Only a few neighboring reporters were there to laugh as I answered \"Harvard Crimson.\"</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps my gripes with the special press credentials are a little unjustified.  Many of my cohorts, from the woman who claimed to be representing the Daily Princetonian even though she went to Stanford, to a scraggly reporter named Jerry Rubin, claiming to represent the counter-cultural Detroit Sun, seemed to be sporting bogus accreditations.  I can see how a restrictive pass system may seem reasonable to those giving out the credentials.  The DNC can risk offending some college reporters who have two months to cool off before they file.  Regardless of the satisfaction derived from getting in, however, it will be a long time before I forget hearing that nominating roll call filter up seven levels to the balcony where I was waiting 25 deep to get a 20-minute pass.</span></p>"}
{"title": "The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>It's difficult to know where to turn for accurate information about the Republican presidential nomination race.  Certainly the last place to look is the national news media.</span></p> <p><span>The Washington Post and The Boston Globe tipped their hands about three weeks ago by running a story whose headline indicated that the race was over--Reagan was privately conceding defeat.  Buried in the 1lt paragraph of the story was the essence of this \"scoop;\" Reagan had, according to an unidentified aide in his camp, referred to the campaign in the past tense--\"I think we raised some important issues in this campaign.\"</span></p> <p><span>The story naturally caused a good deal of consternation at Reagan headquarters, prompting John Sears, campaign manager and Peter Lorre-figure, to announce that Reagan had 1140 delegates.  An obviously bogus count, but one that the Post and Globe were forced to play prominently on their front page in penance for having blown the \"concession\" story.  The ever-sage New York Times played it safe, burying both stories on page 39.</span></p> <p><span>The press also appears to have missed the boat on Reagan's selection of Schweiker as his running-mate.  Analysts were quick to label it a disaster, and the Times keeps on inserting this idiotic quip into all its stories about how Reagan attempts to show himself as less conservative than he is portrayed when in front of the Pennsylvania delegation and Schweiker tries to convince Mississippi delegates that he's less liberal than they think.</span></p> <p><span>In fact, Reagan's choice makes a good deal of political sense.  The Republicans must concede the South and probably most of the border states to Carter--his natural appeal there is too strong to be overcome by a bone like Howard Baker.  Reagan has a natural political base in the West and for the rest of his electoral votes, he would have to count on huge majorities in ethnic centers in the industrial North--states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Ohio.  And on the important \"social\" issues which might appeal to that constituency--amnesty, abortion, busing, prayer in the schools, etc.--Schweiker's views are in perfect accordance with Reagan's.  In such a campaign--which would bear an eerie resemblance to Nixon's 1972 \"acid, amnesty and abortion\" strategy--Schweiker could be a big help.</span></p> <p><span>It probably wouldn't actually work in November--the country's not as right-wing as it was four years ago--but it may be the Republicans' best hope. the Schweiker choice has already had some beneficial effects for Reagan's candidacy; as Sears promised, the delegate count has been thrown into utter confusion, and Ford's momentum has been stalled.  More importantly perhaps, the president has been pressured into a clumsy vice presidential selection process, a pale imitation of Carter's smooth, professional operation of a month ago.  Reagan emerges from the affair as the confident man of action who could mount an aggressive campaign against the Democrats--no small consideration when you're 35 points behind in the polls.  The columnists who have been declaring Reagan dead since New Hampshire may be in for a surprise next week in Kansas City.</span></p>"}
{"title": "At the Olympics | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>After his victory in the Olympic 10,000 meter run, Lasse Viren, later accused of blood doping, loped barefooted around the track holding his arms aloft, a Tiger track shoe in each hand.  By the last stretch, five men waving billowing Finnish flags had filtered down from the stands and joined the victory lap to the roars of 60,000 spectators.  Left behind was Viren, who had slowed to a walk and looked on with a pencil-thin hint of a smile.</span></p> <p><span>Years from now I will no longer remember that the defending gold medalist had coasted along in second place before making his move at the beginning of the bell lap, ending the mounting suspense with a blistering finish.  The controversy over blood doping will be forgotten.  But that victory tour of the massive stadium will remain in my mind, not because of the uproar raised by Puma and Adidas over Viren's \"blatantly commercial\" display of his shoes, but because of the spontaneous surge of nationalist feeling by flag waving, chanting Finns for their tired hero.  The only reason that this 27-minute-plus, 25-lap race held my interest for as long as it did, and I was captivated for the last 10 laps, was the chants of \"Viren, Viren\" and the swelling roar of the crowd rippling around the stadium just ahead of the runners.</span></p> <p><span>During the eight-hour pole vault final I was vocally rooting for United States entrants Dave Roberts and Earl Bell.  I fear that if I had not, the tense, close competition which featured more of athletes psyching each other and themselves than actual leaping would have been a more effective cure for insomnia than a bottle of Nytol.  Certainly, as the endless, often meaningless myriad of women's and men's track heats was paraded before me, the eye searched hopefully for a familiar face and the blue and red costumes with USA lettering on which to focus.</span></p> <p><span>I went to Montreal favoring those who proposed the end of all nationalist sentiment in order for the Olympic spirit to survive, even if it meant eliminating team sports which seemed to be especially conducive to demonstrations of chauvinism.  It was naive to think that you can just turn off expressions of nationalism and, once in Montreal, it became evident that the culture and identity of participant nations is a part of the games.  I have realized since that much of the excitement and pomp of the Olympics would be missing without individual nation's support for their athletes.</span></p> <p><span>I supported athletes because I knew of their efforts to reach the Olympics courtesy of ABC-TV close-ups or their names were familiar.  There was admiration for Lasse Viren, the defending champion at 5,000 and 10,000 meters who had gone on the banquet circuit in Finland for three years before returning to a rigid training regimen.  But usually I was best acquainted with the American athletes.  I was familiar with Dave Roberts's rivalry with teammate Earl Bell, who traded the world record from week to week during the spring.  When all else failed, one could always find an American runner to urge on, for the sake of having someone to cheer for.</span></p> <p><span>And there is nothing wrong with picking a favorite from one's own country; it is part of the ritual of most sports.  Baseball fans throw their allegiance behind teams for no other reason than that they play home games in their city.  College alumni support their old school's football teams.  Even the Greeks of the ancient Olympic games, the ideal for organizers of the modern Olympiad, rooted for representatives of their regions.</span></p> <p><span>The Greeks, however, went further and used victories on the athletic field to claim superiority over rival cities.  This may have made some sense since superiority was measured by the physical strength and skill of soldiers.  Today when such superiority claims are ridiculous, this national pride is what endangers the Olympic games.  We have reached the point when individual athletes are becoming secondary to the interests of their countries.  Politics become involved when participant nations see the Olympics as a threat to their reputations and there are always problems when national Olympic committees exercise control over athletes to avoid embarassment.</span></p> <p><span>Several American athletes have warned against this trend away from the individual.  Discus thrower Mac Wilkins, who won a gold medal at Montreal, told reporters that he was threatened with expulsion by United States Olympic officials for training away from Montreal even though he could not concentrate in the Olympic village.  He went on to say that his victory was an \"achievement for myself.\"  Arnie Robinson, the victor in the long jump competition, felt that his medal was a reward for his long hours of training.  \"I won for myself, my family,\" Robinson said.</span></p> <p><span>Some Americans felt more patriotic such as four gold medal swimmer John Naber (\"I won by myself but for the United States\") and heavyweight boxer John Tate, who draped a jacket over his imposing 228 pound frame which said, \"Big Daddy Tate loves America.\"  But they were not attributing their successes to the nation or President Ford either.</span></p> <p><span>In order to return the Olympics as much as possible to sports, Olympic committees and other influential organizations must not confuse nationalist spirit with national pride.  For example:  In the last week there have been proposals, most notably by men's track and field coach Dr. Leroy Walker, to create national teams in Olympic sports, based on programs established in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) which increased that nation's medal output.  Walker suggested that athletes be picked two years before Olympiads and undergo rigorous training supervised by the team coaches.  This might lead to a few more medals.  But there can hardly be a greater threat to the Olympic ideals of amateurism and emphasis on taking part instead of winning.  Of course these are lofty ideals, but the United States should be honest with itself and not worry how many medals it wins.  A national team concept would be disastrous for the Olympics.</span></p> <p><span>National anthems and flags at award ceremonies should be eliminated.  The impromptu celebrations and flag waving by fans immediately after an athlete's victory always were more meaningful and emotional than the ceremonies hours later.  At Montreal, the ceremonies seemed anti-climactic and were often regarded as an annoyance since other competitions had to be halted.  Their only advantage seemed to be the opportunity they afforded for standing and stretching one's legs.</span></p> <p><span>The news media can do its part by not printing and reporting those idiotic cumulative medal standings.  The first Olympic news item I heard upon my return to the United States was that the country was hopelessly behind the USSR in their battle for medal supremacy.  After a week of watching superlative performances and the emergence of various national heroes, this pronouncement seemed irrelevant.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Koalas and Conservatives | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>P</b>ERHAPS THE most interesting aspect of Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser's visit here last Friday to present a $1 million bicentennial gift is that Fraser made the trip at all.  From the beginning, the decision to donate the money to Harvard was the responsibility of his opponent, former Prime Minister E. Gough Whitlam.  It was Whitlam who announced on July 4, 1975, that the funds would go to the University.  And it was supposed to be Whitlam here on Friday, making a speech that Harvard officials hoped would parallel the address that head of state Willy Brandt made at Harvard in 1972.  Instead, the vicissitudes of Australian politics replaced Whitlam with Fraser, the leader of the conservative, big-business favored Liberal Party and a man with a distinctly different set of policies than Whitlam.</span></p> <p><span>A look at each man's record bears out their differences.  Whitlam, leader of the left-wing Labour Party, held office for only three years, between 1972 and 1975.  But during that short period, he placed new items on the public agenda and pioneered major changes in Australia's foreign and domestic policies.</span></p> <p><span>In foreign affairs, Whitlam tried to make Australia a power in its own right, seeking to broaden relations with producing Third World nation, with which, Australia, a major exporter of raw goods, has something in common.  he was far less hostile to Communist governments in East Asia.  Administrators in his cabinet, for the first time, created trouble for the United States at some of the American military installations in Australia.  Whitlam was prepared to seek greater Asian ties at the expense of U.S. friendship/subordination.</span></p> <p><span>Nationally he created a health insurance policy, boosted educational spending and pushed for federally coordinated aid for the development of cities.  The health insurance plan, called Medibank, pays 85 per cent of the doctor's fees and extended coverage to about one million people formerly left out of Australia's old piecemeal health system.  The plan eliminated the need for high-priced private insurance except for those who insisted on luxurious hospital accommodations.  The four-fold increases in federal monies for education brought Australia within the proportional levels of England and the United States in that area of spending.</span></p> <p><span>Members of Whitlam's cabinet, chosen by the Labour Party caucus, favored fairly radical redistribution of income.  His first labour minister, whose position permitted him to influence the nation's wage rates markedly, consistently supported unions engaged in mandatory federal arbitration.  he \"came to office with the conviction that it was time to give the workers a bigger share of the cake,\" according to a recent issue of The Economist.  Unions received favorable legislation and generous wage increases.  Salaries doubled in two years with women's wages rising 85 per cent.  Public employees' pay hikes paced the nation.</span></p> <p><span>Naturally, all these public spending increases spawned a large budgetary deficit.  And that, coupled with the whopping pay jumps that shot far beyond the productivity rates of the workers, set off rampant inflation.</span></p> <p><span>Inflation was the issue when Fraser, then leader of the Liberal opposition in parliament, called last fall for a cutoff of funds for the Whitlam government.  An impasse ensued.  Finally in November 1975, the Australian governor general, using a little known emergency provision, sacked Whitlam and replaced him with Fraser, who would remain the caretaker prime minister until elections were held next month.  Throughout the campaign Whitlam argued his sacking had been unconstitutional.  Although he originally won broad support with that appeal, the inflation issue triumphed in the end.  A landslide deposited Fraser in the prime minister's office, and his new Liberal-Country Party coalition in power.  (The Country Party represents the nation's extreme conservatives.)</span></p> <p><span>The switch was major.  Where as Whitlam represents a highly interventionist strain of progressive government stressing social change, Fraser symbolizes government based on solely conservative principles.  Last Friday, some of the Australian visitors in Cambridge privately noted the similarities between Fraser and presidential candidate Ronald Reagan.  A look at some of Fraser's recent policy stands extracted from speeches, corroborates the comparison:</span></p> <p><span>The Soviet Union:</span></p> <p><span>The fabric of negotiations with the Soviet Union--which we strongly support--has unfortunately had limited success in winning restraint.  President Ford's abandonment of the term 'detente' clearly shows a recognition that the more extreme claims made for changes in the superpowers' relationship were quite unrealistic.  Stability is disturbed and tension increased if the Soviet Union makes geo-political gains through its support of wars of national liberation, by the use of surrogates.</span></p> <p><span>China:</span></p> <p><span>We look forward to a continuation of good working relationships with the Chinese government both now and in the future.  A realistic view requires us to recognize that despite ideological differences there are important areas where our interests overlap.  ..China is clearly concerned at the Soviet role on her northern and southern frontiers.  Australia and China have a like interest in seeing that Soviet power in the Pacific and South East Asia is balanced by the power of other major states or by appropriate regional arrangements.</span></p> <p><span>Inflation:</span></p> <p><span>The main priority must be to bring inflation under control.  Unless inflation is controlled there can be no return to soundly based economic growth, no long term solution to unemployment and no return to prosperity on which the realization of private and public goals depends.  The government has had a consistent strategy to achieve these objectives.  The main elements of this strategy have been to bring government spending under control; to free resources to the private sector and to individuals; to pursue a responsible monetary policy with clearly announced goals, and to generate a climate of national responsibility in which wage and salary restraint will be possible and in which both business and unions will act with a principal regard for the national interest...  We took a number of steps to help investment and ease the cash crisis for many businesses.  These included a 40 per cent investment allowance; suspension of quarterly tax installments; inquiry into operation of restrictive practices legislation and we stated our intentions for the long term growth of the money supply.</span></p> <p><span>Federal-State Relations:</span></p> <p><span>It is the very strong belief of the federal government that the states should have greater flexibility in ordering their own priorities.  The excessive centralization of power in the federal government has led to unnecessary duplication in administration.</span></p> <p><span>Private Enterprise:</span></p> <p><span>A healthy enterprise is an essential part of the life Australians value.  Private enterprise provides the greatest opportunities:  choice of rewarding jobs, choice of products and choice of services.  It is the system that gives the man in the street the greatest control over what is produced.  In this sense, it is the most democratic system--the system which is most compatible with the freedom Australians value.</span></p> <p><span>Although he hasn't made any drastic cutbacks, Fraser has stated his opposition to many of the Whitlam administration's programs.  He has modified the health insurance plan to make it more attractive for the wealthy to subscribe to private insurance.  He has attempted to cut back on the number of welfare recipients.  He pushed for unions to accept wage increases below the cost of living.  Cuts in educational spending and urban development are expected.</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps the greatest difference between the two administrations is their view of Australia in world context.  There is ample evidence that Fraser may be a throw back to old times, when Australian prime ministers were willing to be dominated first by Britain and then by the United States.  A great believer in America's original goals in Vietnam, Fraser will be a close friend of any rigid Republican administration.  (He is so pro-American that anti-mainstream columnist Alexander Cockburn claimed last year that Fraser arrived in power through a CIA-sponsored coup.)</span></p> <p><span>How do the Australians feel about all this?  American reports are sketchy, but they indicate Fraser has won strong support for his anti-inflationary measures and attempts to bring the budget more into balance.  The Labour Party has the potential to be strong, but only under new leadership.  On the whole Australians don't seem to be unhappy that it was Fraser, not Whitlam, that Cambridge saw last Friday as prime minister</span></p>"}
{"title": "A Snack Pack of Conspiracies and Scum | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>C</b>ONSPIRACY runs rampant.  There is grumbling in the kitchen, muttering on the back porch, gibbering in the parlor.  Back-stage phone-calls jerk marionettes out of their dangling sleep and send them prancing into places of power.  Zombies lurch forward.  Who is Nancy Reagan anyway?  And what dark beast slouches toward Bethlehem to be born?</span></p> <p><span>[MORE], for one.  Or less, for that matter.  Conspiracy abounds.  Takeover conspiracies.  Undue influence conspiracies.  Creamy peanut butter conspiracies.  Extra. Read all about it.  Discredited former vice-crook-president charges Jewishes with Zionist sympathies and media control.  That's just the cover story.  Inside, how (in not so many words) the re-accredited former seed salesman from Plains creamed his way into New York Times headlines, and Memphis-blues-cooed his wormy fishhook into the tangled pickle that is Hunter Thompson's heart.</span></p> <p><span>And all over the magazine, a Triumph of Venality.  An Apogee of Slickness.  In the beginning, you see, or maybe not that early, was Clay Felker, he of New York magazine and The Village Voice.  Felker tended to have this O.K. Corral effect on people--they would go in to talk to him and say, \"New York isn't big enough for the both of us, so... I'll leave.\"  Some with less amicability than others.  And what could be more natural than a former political reporter with New York magazine, a book to his name and money in the family, buying a little freedom of the press.  Hence, Michael Kramer, the new editor and publisher of [MORE].  And hence, just as every three-bit show biz con artist feels the urge to imprint their feet into the drip-dry cement outside Grumman's Chinese Theater, for posterity, that is, and the virtue of newness, Kramer's facelifting and wholesale suburban renewal of [MORE].  From tabloid to magazine, from just covering the print press to umbrella-ing anything that massages--T.V., advertising, publishing, film, and sundry offspring.</span></p> <p><span>What's harder to figure are the people involved in the beauty treatment.  For his executive editor, Kramer brought in Ron Rosenbaum, a contributor to Esquire and New Times who had once been a larynx at The Village Voice in the throaty pre-Felker days.  He hadn't wanted to play Doc Holiday (hired dentist, that is) to Felker's Wyatt Earp, and got out to do eye, ear, nose and throat on his own.  But it seems he's never made it past tonsillectomies--his major contribution to the inaugural issue is a light pan of soft-core pornographic advertising.  No tough social criticism here:  his oh-so-cynical ending is a quote from some Madison Avenue flunky, \"It's that honest and sincere.\"  No, Rosenbaum is a hard sell-out.</span></p> <p><span>Even more puzzling, given Rosenbaum's known antipathies to Felkerism, is Kramer's choice of master cosmetician, or design director, as they are known in these circles.  In charge of the new layout is Milton Glaser, about as close an associate as Felker has--design director for both The Voice and New York, as well as chairman and vice-chairman of various Felker publishing companies.  Glaser's work is appropriately glossy--with the ever-legitimizing Marlboro Man on the back cover and an uninspired Spiro Agnew elongation on the front, plus a new logo without the brackets--since [MORE] is what reporters type at the bottom of pages in an unfinished story and thus is unsuited for a multi-media mag.  Everything inside comes in boxes, sort of like a Kellogg's Snack Pack.  Your eyes get stuck in these armored safes of print, where everything is lined off, column from column, picture from print, headline from subhead.  Milton Glaser just wouldn't get along with Jerry Brown--you gotta flow, Miltie.</span></p> <p><span>And while the whiff of conspiracy emanating from all these Felker connections may be only that, a whiff, the content of [MORE]'s new issue gives off such a stench of conspiracy that you'll forget mere takeover theories.  Foremost on the list of subjects is Spiro Agnew, who would still be in prison were it not for plea-bargainers in the Justice Department like Elliot Richardson.  Instead, Spiro the Kickbacker is on the bestseller list, with a novel charging, among other rantings and ravings, that a Jewish cabal controls the media and exerts extreme pro-Zionist influence on American foreign policy.  Unfortunately, [MORE] chooses to take Agnew seriously, devoting six swampy pages to the various interminglings and more numerous splits among America's Jewish elite, concluding that, yes, there are a number of Jews in the media, but so what?</span></p> <p><span>Other magazines have known how to deal with people of Agnew's ilk.  Rolling Stone, for instance, accompanying Hunter Thompson's 1974 Watergate opus, \"The Scum Also Rises,\" ran a Ralph Steadman cartoon depicting former Attorney-General John \"this country is moving so far to the right you won't recognize it\" Mitchell as a used condom in mid air, about to splash down.  It could just as well have been Spiro; after all, he has as much credence as a year-old Samoa, you know, the kind that comes in five tropical colors.  Agnew's been spouting off for two reasons, probably; he wants to sell his book and he wants business deals with the Arabs.  [MORE]'s motives for running the article are simpler, one suspects--they just couldn't resist the headline \"Jews in the News.\"</span></p> <p><span>Scum, scum, ah, yes, we were talking about Hunter Thompson.  The Mad Dog of modern journalism stunned the reading public when he made The Great Leap of Faith in print and endorsed Jimmy Carter two months ago in Rolling Stone.  [MORE]'s piece on the Thompson conversion not only exposes Carter's conscious seduction process, but also happens to be the finest parody ever of the bent Thompson style.</span></p> <p><span>Very....  strange.  How did it happen, this most bizarre media event of the campaign?  God, could it be the acid?  Has it happened to Hunter, too, what happened to Rennie Davis and so many other twisted LSD casualties--The Dread Post-Acid Gurunoid Syndrome?  Is Jimmy Carter his 14-year-old fat kid?</span></p> <p><span>History will note that it was Hunter Thompson's viciousness that kept Hubert Humphrey out of the 1976 race--too many liberals out there had been rolling in the aisles for years over Thompson's description of Hubie as \"writhing like three iguanas in a feeding frenzy\" over the prospect of nomination.  But Thompson was a sucker for Bob Dylan.  Carter courted and Carter quoted--remember the acceptance speech:  \"I believe in the words of Bob Dylan, that our country can be busy being born, not busy dying.\"  And Thompson joined the ranks of the born-again.</span></p> <p><span>But Thompson is only the half of it.  The complete Carter conspiracy, the Mein Kampf of 1976, comes clear in [MORE]'s interview with R.W. Apple Jr., The New York Times' national political correspondent.  Apple filed the first \"Carter is a serious candidate\" story from Iowa in October 1975.  Apple explains that he went to Iowa to see who was moving, who was organizing, and all his contacts from past campaigns kept saying \"Carter, Carter, Carter...it was enough of a man-bites-dog story that (the Times) played it on page one.\"  Pass the Windex, you say?  Sure.  All Carter had to do was find out whom Apple knew in Iowa, have volunteers knock on their doors every day for a month, give them importunate phone-calls, and Zap!  Front page of the Times, a candidate is born, and the bandwagon starts tooting.</span></p> <p><span>Conspiracy, conspiracy, all is conspiracy, it creeps in this petty pace, Aah.  But there's more, a one-man conspiracy, in fact, devoted only to the propagation of \"seamless\" prose, effortless to read.  His name is John McPhee, he is perhaps the finest non-fiction in America, and he writes on anything, from oranges to flying machines, from tennis to bark canoes.  [MORE]'s profile is not so finely crafted, but McPhee's light has been so long under the bushel basket that even this brief uncovering is dazzling.</span></p> <p><span>There is, in fact, only one article in this month's [MORE] that achieves what the magazine proposes to do:  systematically criticize the media.  There's this conspiracy, you see; the role of television in our society, according to John Leonard, The New York Times' roving cultural correspondent, is to \"purvey legitimizing ceremonies.\"  His wonderfully acerbic rundown of T.V.'s convention coverage ends thusly:</span></p> <p><span>A nominating convention is sort of Ex-Lax for the body politic, a theater of ourselves, a legitimizing ceremony... We know that what we see is a 'media-event' and are smug in the knowledge.  If Walter Cronkite takes it seriously, then we don't have to.  His seriousness absolves us.  There is a 'media-reality' for which we can disclaim responsibility, and a private reality, which is our watching of the magic show as if it had nothing to do with our lives.</span></p> <p><span>And it doesn't.  But it does.  [MORE]'s subject is amorphous--all the more reason to be disappointed when they compartmentalize it, line it off in little boxes that defy comprehensiveness.  [MORE]'s problem will always be that it is trudging along in the ranks of the Slick.  Plumed cavaliers either joust each other or set up straw men, hollow men, graven images of themselves, to knock down.  The magazine is covering a game of daggers sliding out of ruffled tuxedo sleeves, or a swift innuendo to the kidneys, or, at best, a Polaroid snapshot of stasis.  They're all interesting, these conspiracies, but [MORE] has missed the Big One.  There's no world-view here, and the rats are scuttling in the cellar and the ice cap melts.  More is now less.</span></p>"}
{"title": "The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Some recent observations on the media:</span></p> <p><span><i>Liberals and strategically-important southern Africa:</i>  The Rev. Rex Humbard prize for rightist propaganda goes this week to the news editors of The New York times, along with editorial page Editor John B. Oakes.  The outpouring began earlier this week with a by-lined story from Salisbury, Rhodesia, cataloguing the murderous Rhodesian army raid on a black guerilla camp in Mozambique.  More than 300 Africans were killed according to Salisbury sources quoted by The Times; this, in retaliation for a mortar attack on an army camp where four Rhodesian troops died.  Following that story, in which not one Mozambican or guerrilla source was quoted, a piece appeared on the op-ed page, extolling the virtues of white-run Rhodesia and claiming that the nation is as free a state as one can find in Africa.  The only mystery about this article is not why The Times ran it, but what is the real name of the author of this pile of crud?  Is \"Alexander Harrison\" really Daniel P. Moynihan?  or is it Nixon?  This latter guess is where the smart money is going.</span></p> <p><span>That wasn't enough for The Times.  In Thursday's paper we are given the official Salisbury press release version of the Mozambican retaliation for the Rhodesian attack, complete with homeless and brave white people and savage black maniacs.  This courtesy of Reuters, graciously printed on the front page by The Times.  Again, no guerilla or Mozambique comment, or any African black nation's comment for that matter.  Then on the ed page The Times deplores Rhodesia for the thousandth time and backs majority rule.  The clear reason for this:  embarrassment at running all the other racist garbage this week.</span></p> <p><span>I don't know what to think about this, but I've heard that next week The Times will run an op-ed piece by Gerald L. K. Smith saying Jews aren't human beings and will follow this with an editorial insisting that they are.</span></p> <p><span><i>Establishment Hit Men:</i>  I wish I could write this without mentioning two of the most irresponsible reporters alive today--Rowland Evans and Robert Novak--but I'll throw in the towel and admit that many people now believe they are paid members of President Ford's reelection campaign.</span></p> <p><span>Tim Crouse of Rolling Stone has written that Novak is the so-called \"brains\" of the operation--the man with all the sources--and that Rollie is just there to mingle at cocktail parties.  Whatever the internal dynamic, though, every one of their major sources is with the Ford camp:  Alexander Haig, Donald Rumsfeld, Melvin Laird.  They've buried Reagan more times this year than they resurrected Muskie in '72, and while claiming the Schweiker gambit was Reagan's only hope to stave off Invincible Jerry, they say it won't make any difference.</span></p> <p><span>The Evans-Novak tandem's worst failing since Ford's accession is the way they cynically trade inside information for certain politicians' private purposes.  Again and again they've blasted certain guys on the White House staff as part of chief source Rumsfeld's power game.  They're real tight, too, with Treasury Secretary William Simon, who they've boosted for vice-president since the year bagan.</span></p> <p><span>This isn't old hat for them, though.  In 1968 the Louisiana Republican chairman, Tom Stagg, said he though they were genuine members of Nelson Rockefeller's staff.  They had come down to report on the state convention and apparently kept flashing those old Rockefeller polls that always said Rockefeller could win and Nixon couldn't.  Stagg said he couldn't believe they were reporters, much less \"objective.\"  The Rock owns a piece of them.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Slow boat to Washington | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>It was a favorite image during the Kennedy administration:  busloads of Harvard professors converging on Washington to serve as advisors to a president, who, as an alumnus of Harvard, always remained enamored of his alma mater.</span></p> <p><span>The Harvard-Washington axis, as it became known, flourished during the Kennedy and Johnson years.  No matter where you looked, there was a Harvard personality in a top government job:  Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. '38, former professor of History at Harvard, was special assistant to the President; Edwin O. Reischauer, University Professor, was ambassador to Japan; John Kenneth Galbraith, Warburg Professor of Economics Emeritus, was ambassador to India; McGeorge Bundy, former dean of the Faculty, was the President's national security advisor; Archibald Cox '34, Williston Professor of Law, was solicitor-general.  The list was seemingly endless.</span></p> <p><span>In appearance, Harvard involvement in the campaign to elect former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter to the White House rivals that of the Kennedy era, although Carter is no Harvard alumnus.  And, at least at first, not too many members of this academic community were particularly swept away by him.</span></p> <p><span>Jimmy Carter's now-fabled desire to avoid overt reliance on the traditional Boston-Washington axis in this year's presidential campaign consequently doesn't appear to be ruffling too many feathers at Harvard.  What does concern many of Carter's hundreds of newfound advisors, however, is that their massive output may not receive adequate attention, by dint of its sheer bulk.</span></p> <p><span>Carter, who publicly projects ths most populist image of any presidential candidate in recent memory, has gone about the task of assembling his cadre of policy advisors in an eclectic manner--and on such a large scale--that makes it difficult to tell which players will still be with the team if Carter wins the election.</span></p> <p><span>The Carter campaign has already generated what one advisor estimated to be hundreds of thousands of pages of documents and position papers, a large portion of which originated in Cambridge.</span></p> <p><span>The papers have been solicited from members of Carter's approximately 12 task forces, and, according to Harry K. Schwartz '55, Carter's national task force director, they are sifted through, refined, and summarized long before they reach the candidate.  If they present nothing worthy of Carter's attention they are discarded or returned to their sender, Schwartz says.</span></p> <p><span>The number of individuals who have been asked to serve in some capacity on one of Carter's task forces is so large that no one in Atlanta, Washington, or Plains knows it offhand.</span></p> <p><span>\"The term 'task force' is actually a misnomer,\" says Schwartz.  \"These task forces are not really committees, they do not produce white papers, they tend to be low-visibility--pools of individuals with expertise in various areas.\"</span></p> <p><span>That seems to be the beauty of the Carter task force operation.  Carter can simultaneously give the appearance of breaking the insidious Harvard-Washington nexus while still involving unprecedented numbers of Harvard people on his task forces and advisory panels.</span></p> <p><span>The experience of several Harvard faculty members whose support has been sought by the Carter-Mondale ticket tends to corroborate the notion that Carter is not only avoiding sole reliance on one institution, but he is also shunning long-term commitments to his campaign advisors.  There are few, if any individuals, from Harvard or elsewhere, who are currently earmarked for \"automatic\" Carter administration appointments.</span></p> <p><span>The entire Carter advisory operation to date is described by Schwartz as \"building Rolodex files which provide instant access to a funnel of expertise.\"</span></p> <p><span>Milton Katz, Stimson Professor of Law, has perhaps a longer standing commitment to the Carter campaign than anyone from Harvard currently involved in advising the ticket.  He has been serving in what he describes as \"a general advisory capacity\" to Carter since September, 1975, and had been in touch with Carter by mail several months before that.</span></p> <p><span>\"Last September, Jimmy came to my house for dinner,\" Katz explains.  In July, Jimmy reciprocated by inviting Katz to his large scale foreign policy briefing session in Plains, Georgia.  Katz, who is the chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a trustee of several international-relations-oriented organizations, was one of only two Harvard faculty members invited to Plains for any of the briefing sessions.  (The other was Robert Pastor, a research assistant at the Center for International Affairs.)</span></p> <p><span>The complete list of those invited to Plains, in fact, reads more like a comprehensive guide to American academicians and researchers than excerpts from a Harvard course.</span></p> <p><span>\"A good many people during the early scramble were associated with other candidates,\" says Katz.  \"In some cases it (the relative absence of any Harvard Plains-invitees) is accidental; in some cases it represents a feeling that the Carter people want to have a broad representative group.</span></p> <p><span>Schwartz concurs:  \"The Carter campaign is just filled with old Harvard people, including myself.  We've tried to break out of the traditional pattern, although we still have a preponderance from the places you'd expect.\"</span></p> <p><span>Abram Chayes '43, professor of Law, the director of George McGovern's foreign policy task forces in 1972, says he was appointed to Carter's foreign policy group partly because he supported Carter in the Massachusetts primary.  (Not many others did.)</span></p> <p><span>Chayes, who met with Carter during his brief campaign swing through Massachusetts prior to this state's Democratic primary in March, says he's \"sure a lot of these people will find their way down to Washington,\" but quickly adds, \"I expect to be here for a long, long time.\"</span></p> <p><span>Alan Dershowitz, professor of Law, received a note from Carter last year praising the contents of his article in The New York Times on criminal justice.</span></p> <p><span>Dershowitz, who is an outspoken advocate of broad changes in the nation's criminal justice system, was later appointed the coordinator of Carter's task force on crime.</span></p> <p><span>Dershowitz says few Harvard representatives are in Carter's highest advisory ranks largely because \"Harvard wasn't overly enthusiastic about the Carter candidacy early on.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Harvard is always much too represented in these things,\" Dershowitz says.  \"It's marvelously refreshing to see some brilliant people from elsewhere involved.\"</span></p> <p><span>Neither Dershowitz nor Katz could predict whether his key advisory role would ultimately result in a Washington appointment.  Dershowitz was emphatic in expressing the desire to remain in Cambridge.  (If my participation succeeds in helping them during the campaign though, that's fine\")</span></p> <p><span>The search for Carter advisors, Schwartz says, culminated in \"tapping the newer people--identifying the women and the young thinkers and bringing them in.\"</span></p> <p><span>Dorothy S. Zinberg, a research associate in the Program for Science and International Affairs and an assistant professor of Psychology, is a member of Carter's science policy task force.</span></p> <p><span>\"All in all, I feel very positive about my involvement so far,\" she says.  \"I am so committed to the goals Carter has, I'm willing to work even if the personal gain for me is zero.\"</span></p> <p><span>Despite her enthusiastic support for Carter's ideals, however, Zinberg does express some reservations about the way they may be implemented.</span></p> <p><span>\"I do think that I am part of the affirmative action delegation, although I think he is genuinely committed to bringing in women, and tapping their resources,\" she says.</span></p> <p><span>Zinberg worries that much of the 600,000-plus pages of science policy recommendations already generated by her task force may never see the light of day.</span></p> <p><span>\"We'll just have to wait and see if there isn't just one big paper shredder at the end of the pipeline,\" she says.</span></p> <p><span>Zinberg, like virtually all of her colleagues in the Carter advisory camp, does not envision any expansion of her present role after a victory in November.</span></p> <p><span>\"I can assure you,\" she says.  \"I'll still be at 9 Div. Avenue.\"</span></p> <p><span>Zinberg has been called upon by the Carter forces to draft a paper on her interpretation of the function of science education, to critique a report on issues confronting scientists which task force coordinator Lewis Branscomb, IBM's vice president and chief scientist, drafted, and to participate in a science briefing with the Democratic candidate before he debates President Ford.</span></p> <p><span>Her role in the advisory effort so far stands in contrast to that of fellow science policy task force member Harvey Brooks, McKay Professor of Applied Physics.</span></p> <p><span>So far, Brooks says, his involvement has been limited to a couple of phone conversations with Branscomb, and subsequent invitations to submit papers on science policy.  Brooks has not yet taken Branscomb up on any of those invitations, but he says his role may expand as the campaign continues.</span></p> <p><span>Charles Haar, Brandeis Professor of Law, is the coordinator of the housing and land use task force, one of the few advisory panels that has actually convened as a group.</span></p> <p><span>Haar, who met with Carter two weeks ago, says he is encouraged by the amount of input his group has been granted thus far, although \"they haven't taken everything we've recommended into consideration.\"</span></p> <p><span>Marcia Guttentag, lecturer on Education, is a member of Carter's health task force, and helped draft policy recommendations for the increased involvement of women in the field of mental health.  Guttentag terms her role a \"continuing involvement\" with the Carter-Mondale ticket, and adds that she is \"very impressed by their very systematic effort to locate women with important skills thoughout the country.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Carter has been going after people who can deliver substantively, not based on place of origin,\" she adds, \"and he has shown great taste.\"</span></p> <p><span>***</span></p> <p><span>Martin Feldstein, professor of Economics and a member of Carter's economic policy task force, says he believes that the role that all the task forces play in the formulation of policy initiatives will diminish as the campaign wears on.</span></p> <p><span>\"There will have to be more time for campaigning, and less time for drafting position papers,\" he says.</span></p> <p><span>Feldstein is more definite than many of his colleagues on the role he feels task force members will play in a Carter-Mondale administration.  \"If the ticket wins, they'll have several people to help work on their policy; there will be jobs for a number of permanent staff members,\" he explains.</span></p> <p><span>It is clear that no one in Cambridge is openly lusting after an advisory position in the Carter administration.  Tacit in virtually all Harvard-Carter advisors' statements concerning their own futures with Carter is the understanding that Carter seems to want to remain without strings at least for now.  If he really is beholden to no one, he would in all probability select his closest advisors from the rands of those from whose help he has profited most during the campaign.</span></p> <p><span>\"I take it for granted that Carter, a man of the people, would like to draw on as wide a selection of people as possible in his campaign,\" explains Katz.</span></p> <p><span>And if you can extrapolate from what appears to be the prevailing sentiment in the Carter camp these days, there probably won't be busloads of Harvard faculty members making the jaunt down to Washington next January.</span></p> <p><span>In the meantime, as Zinberg puts it, \"a lot of people used to be getting deference and action who don't now; but everybody is working, and I feel very positive about it.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Taking the Easy Way Out | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>HE POINT OF documentary cinema at its best is to convey things as they really are, events as they really occurred, in all their beauty, in all their terror, in all their pathos.  In this sense, <i>Idi Amin Dada</i> is documentary at its worst, a combination of cheap shots, superficial political commentary, and cultural racism, which results in a meaningless comic portrait of a genocidal dictator.  A Swiss director, Barbet Schroeder, took a crew to Uganda in 1974, after having received express permission to do a film portrait of the Ugandan President, who had assumed power in a coup d'etat in 1971.</span></p> <p><span>During the intervening three years, Amin had become something of an international villain/buffoon, due to his massacre or explusion of the nearly 100,000 Asians who had formed the managerial elite in Uganda during the colonial period, his admiration for Hitler's efforts to exterminate European Jewry, expressed in a telegram to Kurt Waldheim the day after the murder of the Israeli Olympic athletes in Munich, and his seemingly psychotic messages to other heads of state such as Tanzania's Julius Nyerere.  Amin saw the film, which consists almost entirely of interviews with him and scenes of him in action, directing war games and making speeches, before it was released, and he evidently found it sufficiently flattering to allow it and Schroeder out of Uganda.  Apparently we the public are supposed to perceive this fact as bitterly ironic, as though it should be extraordinarily surprising that the man who announced his intention to build a national monument to Hitler should have so poor a sense of public relations.</span></p> <p><span>Of the cheap shots, the most striking is that the film is conducted entirely in English.  That is to say, not only are the interviews in English, but Amin's public displays are also in English, and for the most part, whenever his subordinates are called upon to address him, they also speak in English.  Now the fact is that Amin's ability to articulate himself in English is limited at best, and at times, as in a speech he attempts to deliver to the assembled physicians of Kampala, he is almost completely incoherent.  Although he is undoubtedly something less than a brilliant political and social theorist in Swahili, his flawed English tends to make him appear a borderline idiot, which he certainly is not.  It is unfortunate that Schroeder chose to make a political film in and about a country whose language he does not speak.  But it is even more unfortunate that, rather than avail himself of the services of an interpreter, he deliberately utilized the language barrier, apparently to place particular emphasis on Amin's frighteningly shallow, misinformed, and warped worldview.  The effect however, is not to frighten, but to amuse.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>N A CABINET meeting, staged for the cameras, and conducted of course in English, Amin launches into a convoluted and barely coherent explication of what he says at the outset are seven major points.  After exhorting his ministers not to be hesitant and indecisive like women, not to be late to their meetings or out of their offices when he calls, and not to dilly-dally about executing spies, he has gotten so lost that he forgets the last four points.  And as he rambles from non-sequitur to non-sequitur, appearing completely ludicrous, Schroeder's camera pans the room--the ministers are, to a man, taking diligent notes or listening in rapt attention.  Now certainly this scene, with its Emperor's New Clothes quality to it, strikes an amusing chord.  But when one considers that it is likely that not a single person in the room, save for the French film crew, understands a word of what Amin is saying as he babbles away, much of the humor quickly vanishes.  And to compound this weakness in approach, there is also a racist slant in the camera work, reminiscent of the worst excesses of Birth of a Nation, exemplified by Schroeder's decision to focus on one of the ministers as he absentmindedly picks his nose.  If Schroeder's point here is to demonstrate the absoluteness of Amin's power within his government, or the simplicity of his subordinates, or both, he does not succeed in making that point very poignant.  On a superficial level, the utter ludicrousness of the scene vitiates any sense of horror.  And if one gives it a second thought, remembering the language issue, the scene is virtually devoid of meaning.</span></p> <p><span>Beyond the occasional slip into the D.W. Griffith syndrome, and far more serious, is the pervasive cultural racism in <i>Idi Amin Dada.</i>  Among the moments that are apparently meant to be particularly hilarious are shots of Amin in native dress, participating in what seem to be Ugandan dances and ceremonies.  These scenes have no purpose in the film whatsoever, unless Schroeder assumes that his audience will find practices and rites belonging to an alien culture inherently amusing.  One is forced to wonder how a Ugandan audience would receive a film showing President Ford donning a football helmet and marching with the band during half-time of the Michigan-Ohio State game.</span></p> <p><span>Schroeder makes an attempt to provide a contextual narrative discussing the major events of Amin's reign.  Surely it would be too much to expect a sophisticated political analysis of the Amin regime as background narration to an hour and a half film, but Schroeder's effort is nonetheless startlingly superficial.  Amin's \"economic war\"--the wholesale destruction of the Asian community in Uganda--is accorded a scant few sentences and dismissed as a failure.  That is however, considerably better than the discussion of Amin's shift from a relatively close relationship with Israel to a virtual alliance with Lybia.  While the pathology of Amin's anti-Zionist position is explored in detail, in all its vicious paranoia, no serious effort to explain the political and/or economic motivations of his new alliance is attempted.  It would seem that one is meant to chalk the whole thing up to the whimsical ways of a deranged dictator.</span></p> <p><span>The single redeming feature of Schroeder's film is its success in conveying a sense of Amin's personality and the origins of his political and personal philosophy, such as it is.  For language barrier or not, Amin clearly emerges as something of a psychopath, evidenced by his manaical giggle when questioned about his affection and admiration for Hitler, by his professed knowledge of the time and circumstance of his own eventual death, and by numerous other incidents and remarks.  It is apparent that he is a complete dupe of the most militant anti-Israel forces in the Arab world, believing in and parroting the worst elements in anti-Zionist propaganda.  At one point he claims to have discovered a secret plan for Jewish world dominance, detailed in a book that the Israelis are anxious to suppress, lest the plot be exposed.  It is because of his fear that the Israelis will get their hands on his book--which Amin apparently believes to be the sole copy outside of Israel--that Amin will only allow Schroeder to look at the book, rather than keep it.  The book is <i>The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.</i></span></p> <p><span>The film also succeeds in capturing Amin's egomania, depicting his obsession with uniforms, parades, and demonstrations of fealty be his subjects.  But beyond these all too few salient features, there is just not very much there.  And what is particularly serious about the failure of this film is the unbelievable horror of life in Uganda since Amin's ascendancy.  In an article on \"Amin's Butchery\", in last week's New York Review of Books, David Martin cites the report of Edward Rugumayo, Amin's first minister of education, who fled the country two years after the coup d'etat.</span></p> <p><span>He described eight methods of killing used at Makindye prison.  These involved making prisoners line up and ordering the first to smash the second man's head with a hammer.  The process was repeated down the line until the last man was shot.  Another method was to cut flesh from a victim and force him to eat it until he died.  Rugumayo said it was estimated that 80,000 to 90,000 people died in Amin's first two years in power:  but he admitted that this might be a conservative figure.</span></p> <p><span>The details of what has happened and continues to happen in Uganda are emerging only gradually.  But what is already known is more than enough.  Chaplin succeeded with <i>The Great Dictator</i> because he made a mockery of Hitler based on exactly what Hitler was, at a time when National Socialism was a much admired idealogy, and the emergence of a New Germany a much admired phenomenon, by all too many in the western world.  Schroeder barely scratches the surface of what Amin really is and what Amin's rule in Uganda is all about.  Sacrificing serious analysis for attempts at farce, and cheap attempts at that, completely undermines the potential of <i>Idi Amin Dada.</i>  Schroeder should not have settled for the easy way.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Al Vellucci:  Pepperoni and homemade wine | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The last time I saw Al Vellucci on the street, he was at his best.  It was a bright Saturday afternoon, one of those near-hot late summer days that make living in Massachusetts seem worthwhile, and that make the dank winter seem so horrible and faraway.  Al (I'll call him by his first name, like everybody else) was in great form, in his element, mingling with and affirming his identity with the average citizens who were gathered that day for the last afternoon of the Mayor's Marketplace in Kendall Square.</span></p> <p><span>The market, which was the Mayor's idea in the first place, is one of those Bicentennial Community events, not-for-profit but for-the-people.  Physically, it's simply a strip of unused roadway cut off from traffic for the day.  Peddlers pay $2 a day for a curbside space, pull in their Pinto wagons and draw out all manner of treasure and trash to sell to the public.</span></p> <p><span>But the marketplace is not just a physical space; it's an event.  Even if you don't buy anything, you can register to vote there, or listen to music, or just talk to other real-Cambridge people.  You can browse among the \"collectibles,\" rummage through experienced clothing, watch Brother Blue, resplendent in his geegaws and jingle bells, dancing, in a manner of speaking, with a seven-year old innocent bystander.</span></p> <p><span>Of special interest, perhaps, is a certain Aldo who preserves the celebrity faces of the current television season, along with other worthies, in paint on little flat rocks.  He calls it \"rock-art,\" and among the offerings we found that afternoon were Gerald R. Ford, Ed Asner, the gruff editor of Mary Tyler Moore fame, a rock with Mike on it (Douglas, that is), Merv (Griffin), even one with Pat Mitchell (I know who she is but I'm not sure what to call whatever it is that she does).  Even Mary Hartman was preserved on stone.  The only face missing from Aldo's rock pile is the face behind the marketplace, the senior legislator in Cambridge and current occupant of the mayor's office, the little man's pol, the honorable Alfred E. (for Effort) Vellucci.</span></p> <p><span>If Aldo had captured Al's countenance, it would have been something like this:  a thinning silver-covered pate with remnants of the original black peeking out from beneath, all of it swept back along an unusually neat part; a smooth unflappable brow, something a gambler might try to cultivate (you cannot tell when he's riled or when a political card is up his sleeve by reading this brow); unremarkable eyebrows and ears; something of a potato nose; and the eyes of a predator bird.</span></p> <p><span>The eyes really have it with this mayor.  As I walked up to greet him that afternoon, those eyes met mine, then glanced back over my shoulder, then back to my eyes.  Rather than just stand and chat, Al grabbed my arm and walked, ever so slowly, with me in tow along the path he would have taken if I had never even come along.  We must have looked like those Italian men who stroll, arm in arm, across the ancient bridges or along the boulevards of any Italian town; very relaxed, yet somehow infused with purpose, even if that purpose is only not to stop walking.</span></p> <p><span>That kind of walking fits Al's political style, a unique combination of firm intention and casual appearance.  Most of all, it gave Al the opportunity to keep on moving those eyes, to keep nodding to people going in the other direction, while giving me the (incorrect) impression that, for the time being, he was talking only to me.  But when a limousine pulled up at the far end of the strip that defines the Mayor's Marketplace, even without looking at them I knew those eyes had moved to the moving car just as surely as a chicken hawk's eyes home in on its quarry.</span></p> <p><span>Aldo would have had a terrible time capturing the mouth, I am sure.  Within an arc of less than, say, 30 degrees, that mouth can convey every important feeling in the politician's guidebook.  At the top of the arc, there is a smile that fairly breathes a grandfatherly benevolence.  A shade below that, there's an omni-purpose politician's grin.  At the middle of the arc, Al's smile turns into a squarely set, unrehearsed-looking deadpan, suitable for framing and hanging in a standup comics' Hall of Fame.  And at the bottom of the arc, there's a ferocious scowl, reserved for anyone foolish enough to disrupt the proceedings of the honorable City Council.</span></p> <p><span>The rate at which this mouth can run through its tiny arc is remarkable in itself.  At a recent meeting of the council, over which Al gleefully presides, a group of taxi drivers was gathered to press a certain point.  When the hackmen were respectfully applauding the grandstand overtures of some of the councilors (\"I've supported the cabbies for 30 years\"), it was Grandfather Al beaming down from the dais.  When the drivers were testifying, Deadpan Al nodded gravely at their protests, seemingly recording it all into his store of wisdom.  But when catcalls and boos started to swell in the gallery, Ferocious Al glanced, disgusted, toward the City Clerk and said, <i>sotto voce,</i> \"They sure can turn on you.\"  He might have said, \"I sure can turn on them.\"</span></p> <p><span>I don't know if Al was born this way.  It hardly matters.  Because everything that is successful in local politics, a big first-name constituency, the ability to make people smile and think you are someone who'll listen to their worries, the ready handshake and the meaningful wink, seem to have been inborn or ingrained in Al, and it all works to his benefit.  (I had a dream the other night in which Al figured prominently.  I dreamt that, when he was born 61 years ago in East Cambridge, where he still lives, the infant Al Vellucci raised his hand to stop the attending midwife from slapping him into the first breath of life, and offering his pink paw to the woman, said, \"How are va.\")  But while it doesn't matter what he was like before he went into politics, where he grew up has made the difference in Al's life.  With his reputation as the ally of the working people who live in his district, his good name as a loyal servant of the city at large, (buttressed by his visibility in and around City Hall and at every civic function where people watch to see who's there) Al has emerged as the friendly politician, the sort of guy you'd like to have dinner with at home, someone under whose thick political skin beats a warm human heart.  Someone who's real.</span></p> <p><span>The problem with taking this down-to-earth appearance at face value is that, when you're talking about the tenor of community politics, part of what you have to look at is the fixtures in that community, and I don't mean the plumbing.  Anyone who considers it will realize that, on a ward-by-ward basis, incumbents have a big advantage as long as they don't do too bad a job.  The history of boss rule as a major political structure in many American cities bears this out.  In short, provided he can remember the names of the men and women who will vote to keep him in office, the longer a local incumbent can hang onto his office the more likely he is to stay there.  And, at the same time, he will also solidify his status as a community fixture.</span></p> <p><span>Two products of this incumbent mentality influence the admixture of guts and guff that make up Al's political style.  First, that he is practically a monument in his community lends a security to his ability to continue living a local political life.  If someone is pretty certain he can be reelected, he can say things that verge on the outrageous or the absurd, so long as the man himself is not absurd.  Second, incumbents find formulas that work for them, and they will stick by them as long as they carry some political benefit.  One of the formulas Al lit upon long ago is the home-community-politics nexus.</span></p> <p><span>Al hears that Harvard's football team has won their league championship; he invites them over for pepperoni and homemade wine.  You've got a beef with the way city government is run?  Al will talk it over with you, anytime, his place over pepperoni and homemade wine.  You're a journalist looking for an interview?  Come on over tonight, we're having lasagna dinner at city hall and, oh yes, there might be some special Vellucci brand homemade wine.  It may not be the accepted panacea for all your political ills, but, in Al's mind, you can get pretty far with a smile and a glass of homemade wine.  I'd like to taste the stuff sometime; our mayor has gotten more political mileage with homemade wine than a Chevette gets on a tank of Amoco supreme.</span></p> <p><span>Next to his use of homelife as a political tool, the most important feature of Al's rhetorical grab-bag is his odd combination of humor and bombast.  Once, when he was trying to deliver a speech on nothing in particular at the beginning of a council meeting, Councilor Al asked aloud if anyone was listening to what he was saying.  (He hadn't been reelected mayor yet; everybody listens to the mayor).  When there was no reply, Al moved that the meeting be adjourned.  Since it was Monday night and there was a football game on TV starting at nine, the male councilors voted to go along with the proposal.  The meeting lasted exactly seven-and-a-half minutes, scarcely enough time for the pledge of allegiance and the minute of meditation.  I asked Al if this was the shortest meeting he'd ever attended.  His deadpan reply:  \"This is the shortest meeting in the history of the government of the United States of America.\"  Ridiculous, yes, but lovable too.</span></p> <p><span>It's carryings on of this sort that make Al Vellucci the most \"colorful\" of the politicians who haunt the oaken corridors of Cambridge city hall.  On the one hand, there is lovable Al, caring for his tribe and defending the interests of the common man in the realm of city politics.  On the other, there is the Al full of bombast, homelife and trivial, lovable sound and fury.  The combination must work, because nobody now on the council has been there as long as mayor Al (22 years, as long as this reporter has been alive).  I'd love to know if Al uses the same tactics to get through the working day at his regular job as a tax assessor for the Commonwealth.  It must be a \"colorful\" variation on an otherwise grey occupation.</span></p> <p><span>Given his disposition to aid the common man and his twisted satirical bent, it should be no surprise to Harvard students that Al Vellucci has a score of cures for \"creeping Harvarditis,\" and that he promotes a new anti-Harvard scheme almost every week.  Who can forget his plan to pave the Yard and open a municipal garage?  Or to turn Wadsworth House into a public urinal?  And then to shut down the triangle between the Yard and the Science Center to build a track for the town's high school athletes?  The list of Al's remedies for Harvard could be as long as Kissinger's thesis, but the fact of the matter is simple:  Al loves to hate Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>His feelings for The Crimson proceed along much the same lines.  One of Al's favorite jokes is to rename the Crime \"the Harvard Iceberg\" on account of what he perceives as a lack of any humor on the part of the paper.  More than once he has offered a resolution to rename Plympton St. \"Lampoon Avenue\" in honor of the \"really important\" publication that abuts that road.  And when Al took out a political ad in last year's election supplement, by chance he discovered a \"plot\" to hijack all of that morning's Crimsons.  After alerting the business staff of the nefarious scheme, Al introduced to the council and saw to passage an order that Cambridge police keep a \"keen and constant watch\" on the Out of Town newsstands.  Thanks to his vigilance, no Crimsons were stolen that election day.</span></p> <p><span>I am reminded of the first time I saw Al Vellucci in public.  He was at his worst.  A certain member of the gallery, a local lawyer who devotes much of his time to the welfare of the central Cambridge community, was trying to gain the floor to speak on some issue, I think it was zoning regulations in his neighborhood.  Al and this man have never exchanged friendly words in my presence.  As the man waited somewhat impatiently at the dock that divides up the council chambers, Al went into a rambling spiel that lasted more than 25 minutes, delving into topics as disparate as the leash law and the rising incidence of public dopesmoking.  It was a sort of <i>ad hominem</i> filibuster, although in my assessment at the time it was a waste of time for everyone and a waste of effort on the part of a crackpot councilor.  Al talked about Italian cooking, he talked about the deterioration of respect for the city council, but mostly, it seemed, he just talked.  I left that meeting discouraged and disappointed that one man could act so badly in public while nobody bothered so much as to ask him to yield for five minutes.  It was low-down local politics at its worst, I remember thinking.</span></p> <p><span>The only thing that makes my view of Mayor Vellucci different now is that over time I've gotten to know how he acts; I've come to expect Al to act that way, and, I'm glad to say, I've come to like it.  He's the kind of man who makes no sense whatsoever until you understand the background and the reasons for the way he is.  He might be ridiculous at times, unfathomable, at others.  But over time, Al grows on you.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Defining 'Born Again' | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The phrase \"born again\" conjures a variety of images--straight and clean-cut young people handing out tracts on street corners, sudden revelations, a provincial team spirit for God with a sprinkling of busybodiness.</span></p> <p><span>Jimmy Carter says he's born again.  Journalists have written about his religion and speculated as to how it affects him and evokes the image he projects.  But they have shied away from defining what born again means.</span></p> <p><span>Carter says he entered into a dynamic born again experience after he lost the 1966 gubernatorial race in Georgia.  The defeat left him wondering what he was to do and where he was going.  He said that his personal relationship with God through the born again experience offered him meaning, at what appears to have been a breaking point in his life.</span></p> <p><span>The born again event occurs when one accepts God's forgiveness for his sins through Christ's atonement on the cross.  One then enters a new life, in which he relates to God and his associates in a spirit of love.</span></p> <p><span>It is an emotional experience, for the concepts of forgiveness and love have extensive impact that people who have been born again feel reach cords in the human psyche that few experiences in life can touch.  A change in lifestyle can occur because of the very strength of the truth one has apprehended and applied to his life.</span></p> <p><span>Although Carter was raised in the Southern Baptist church, he consciously chose a personal relationship with God a decade ago.</span></p> <p><span>Carter rejects efforts to circumscribe his spiritual experience by simply relegating it to the Southern Baptist tradition.  He said, \"I'm a human being.  I'm not a packaged article that you can put in a little box and say here's a Southern Baptist...he's got to be predictable.\"</span></p> <p><span>Carter's so-called \"hotline\" to God through prayer appears to be his working relationship with the non-material world.  According to the Democrats' press aide Mark Cohen, Carter reads the Bible (in Spanish) every night.  He is thereby working to maintain a continuous connection with God, the aide says.  Carter's spiritual experience gives him a \"sense of peace and equanimity and assurance,\" he says.</span></p> <p><span>William James in his <i>Varieties of Religious Experience</i> quotes Louis Agassiz as saying, \"One can see no farther into a generalization than just so far as one's previous acquaintance with particulars enables one to take it in.\"  James's book is based on interviews with people who have had a spectrum of religious experiences.</span></p> <p><span>The following is in a similar format.  The individuals interviewed have intimate knowledge of the born again phenomenon, through association with Eastern Nazarene College or Barrington College, two schools in the New England area that encourage the tradition of the born again experience.</span></p> <p><span>The interviewees describe the born again encounter, and some offer comments on Carter as a presidential nominee who comes from a born again religious tradition.</span></p> <p><span>Harvey Cox, Thomas Professor of Divinity and a member of the Old Cambridge Baptist Church, says that Jesus did not necessarily introduce the idea of rebirth, for a rebirth practice can be found throughout preliterate tribal religious groups in Australia and Africa.</span></p> <p><span>In these civilizations, at puberty, boys are taken from their mothers and placed in isolation in a womb-like situation in a tent.  After many days they are pulled out by their heads through their fathers' legs.  At this recapitulation of the original birth experience, they babble like babies.  But soon afterward they are given weapons of adult men to signify that they are ready after their second birth to accept the responsibilities of adult life.</span></p> <p><span>Cox referred to \"born again\" as an experience rather than an institutional affiliation.  But the words become conventionalized, he says.  They function as a code with overtones.  They are, like an evocation, symbol-suffused.  As with the symbolic communion in the Catholic church, vibrations reverberate around the term, Cox says.  Included in those vibrations is the question, are you serious about your religion--is it personal?</span></p> <p><span>Cox said that Hamilton Jordan, Carter's national campaign director, comes from a radical New Testament background in the South.  His father, Clarence Jordan, was a radical populist and Southern Baptist, who started a farm called <i>Koinonia</i> (the Greek New Testament word for community) in Americas, Georgia.  This farm was an inter-racial co-operative group with emphasis on pacifism.</span></p> <p><span>Cox mentions the Fellowship of Southern Churchmen, another populist group in the Southern tradition from which Carter has emerged.  That group was a tenant and farmer organization that the Southern Baptists and Presbyterians formed many decades ago.  Cox says they were \"swimming against the stream of racism\" and prejudice against poor whites long before that became a popular middle class Northern cause.</span></p> <p><span>Reverend Paulanne Balch is also a member of the Old Cambridge Baptist Church and is a graduate of Andover-Newton School.  She is presently a chaplain at Mt. Auburn Hospital.  She says that \"born again\" is the experience of psychic birth marked by a profound sense of self-recognition and participation in one's life and culture.  There is an acknowledgment of the condition of one's life and an experience of pain connected with the loss of illusions.  Then a descent, a letting go.  Finally, she adds, there's a resurrection where the body is healed; \"the scales fall from the eyes,\" and one is no longer confined by the old ways of seeing things.  The growth process can then begin.</span></p> <p><span>She says it is similar to psychotherapy, because the person is willing to face herself, and is committed to liberating herself for a healthier, freer life.  In the midst of contradictory, alienating experiences, a surrender makes possible a deeper unity in living.</span></p> <p><span>Balch found that this spiritual break-through implements a sort of mind expansion whereby one no longer needs to define his life by the limitations of his past.  He is born into his inner world and finds there the potential to become what he wants to be.</span></p> <p><span>Of course, she says, the individual decides whether she will use the experience to relate to her social and political milieu or provincially shut out her neighbor from her private experience.</span></p> <p><span>She believes that the born again experience energizes hope in one's life.  She suggests that Carter's born again encounter possibly unlocked that hope in him, which, combined with drive and ambition, has facilitated his political ascent in the last five years.</span></p> <p><span>Jean Mullen, who has taught at Eastern Nazarene College, compares the steps in conversion with the Alcoholics Anonymous program in which one admits she's helpless and can't help herself.  That's the beginning of being able to face onself and be healed, she says.</span></p> <p><span>She says one exposes the wrongs of his past and basically clears up the record when he accepts pardon from God through faith.  She says that baptism, an integral part of the Southern Baptist church, symbolizes the old life being cleansed and the new emerging.</span></p> <p><span>Mullen has a born again experience that involves a communication with God through prayer, in which she tries to be open to God's \"nudges\" or direction.  She does not expect miraculous changes in her life, but rather a developing awareness of the right timing and a sensitivity to others' attitudes and feelings.</span></p> <p><span>She said she believes that the ability to know when to enact social reforms depends on that type of timing.  If the people are ready for a reform and pushing for it, a president who has been reborn can sense that the social climate is ready for new legislation.</span></p> <p><span>Mullen, however, is uncertain if Carter is actually in tune with the people, although he does show concern for the unemployed.  But she views him as humanistic, and would expect him to be an honest president, rather than a scoundrel.</span></p> <p><span>Reverend Jack Daniel, associate minister of youth and education at First Parish Church in Westwood, calls the born again experience a touchstone.  It is the beginning of faith, an overwhelmingly real metaphysical and psychological experience that lends a feeling of zeal and confidence to one's life.</span></p> <p><span>He speaks of the new dimension of life that is opened by being born again.  The change is just as radical as the baby moving from the uterus environment to the air-breathing environment.  One is shaken to the roots of his life; he finds a whole new orientation.</span></p> <p><span>Daniel correlates the Second Great Awakening, a period of spiritual revivalism in the early 1800s, with social movements.  At that time revival leaders encouraged the establishing of institutions like many schools, hospitals, orphanages, and homes for unwed mothers.</span></p> <p><span>Steven Green, a member of the Good Shepherd Episcopal Church in Watertown, converted from Judaism to Christianity after researching Christ's teachings.  He says he knows God through being born again, in a way that is comparable to falling in love.</span></p> <p><span>Green says that knowing and loving the Creator of the Universe changes his perspective on the scheme of things, and that out of that love naturally grows a commitment to serve God.</span></p> <p><span>Green expects Carter to be more populist than corporate in his interests as a born again Christian.  Since the Bible teaches compassion and that all are created in God's image, Green says he would expect a born again president to try and deal fairly with the needs of all people.</span></p> <p><span>Careyleah MacLeod, who attended Eastern Nazarene College, says that she was raised in a Northern Baptist church that taught conversion, but that she had a blinding born again type of experience in her early twenties, through the use of drugs (LSD).  At that time, the \"cobwebs\" were cleared from her head, and her thinking and perception became clearer.  This experience represented to her a culmination of spiritual quests.  She recognized the beginning of a new lifestyle, which is more in tune with the way she wants to live and interact with others.</span></p> <p><span>MacLeod admires Carter for being honest enough to say he is born again.  She says institutional sin exists on a large scale, and there's no individual to take responsibility or feel the guilt.  Carter wants to make the American people believe he is morally responsible; he is direct about that, she says.</span></p> <p><span>What makes better sense, she says, than an upright and moral Baptist to appeal to the Republicans who can't respond to the Republican Party because of the institutional sin that Ford just swept under the rug?</span></p> <p><span>Kenneth Clauser, who teaches at Barrington College, regards \"born again\" as a catch-all phrase, almost a cliche in Fundamentalist church circles, that can result in a cliched experience because the words lose their meaning.</span></p> <p><span>He calls someone who has a personal relationship with the historical Christ a born again Christian.  This person accepts the New Testament vision of Christ as a pattern for his life.  If followed carefully, a radical lifestyle can emerge.  Some of the New Testament calls for change in the social order.  Christ spoke in behalf of the oppressed and poor, the social outcasts.  He was not a \"corporation man\" but a radical figure, Clauser says</span></p>"}
{"title": "Slow boat to Washington | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>It was a favorite image during the Kennedy administration:  busloads of Harvard professors converging on Washington to serve as advisors to a president, who, as an alumnus of Harvard, always remained enamored of his alma mater.</span></p> <p><span>The Harvard-Washington axis, as it became known, flourished during the Kennedy and Johnson years.  No matter where you looked, there was a Harvard personality in a top government job:  Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. '38, former professor of History at Harvard, was special assistant to the President; Edwin O. Reischauer, University Professor, was ambassador to Japan; John Kenneth Galbraith, Warburg Professor of Economics Emeritus, was ambassador to India; McGeorge Bundy, former dean of the Faculty, was the President's national security advisor; Archibald Cox '34, Williston Professor of Law, was solicitor-general.  The list was seemingly endless.</span></p> <p><span>In appearance, Harvard involvement in the campaign to elect former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter to the White House rivals that of the Kennedy era, although Carter is no Harvard alumnus.  And, at least at first, not too many members of this academic community were particularly swept away by him.</span></p> <p><span>Jimmy Carter's now-fabled desire to avoid overt reliance on the traditional Boston-Washington axis in this year's presidential campaign consequently doesn't appear to be ruffling too many feathers at Harvard.  What does concern many of Carter's hundreds of newfound advisors, however, is that their massive output may not receive adequate attention, by dint of its sheer bulk.</span></p> <p><span>Carter, who publicly projects the most populist image of any presidential candidate in recent memory, has gone about the task of assembling his cadre of policy advisors in an eclectic manner--and on such a large scale--that makes it difficult to tell which players will still be with the team if Carter wins the election.</span></p> <p><span>The Carter campaign has already generated what one advisor estimated to be hundreds of thousands of pages of documents and position papers, a large portion of which originated in Cambridge.</span></p> <p><span>The papers have been solicited from members of Carter's approximately 12 task forces, and, according to Harry K. Schwartz '55, Carter's national task force director, they are sifted through, refined, and summarized long before they reach the candidate.  If they present nothing worthy of Carter's attention they are discarded or returned to their sender, Schwartz says.</span></p> <p><span>The number of individuals who have been asked to serve in some capacity on one of Carter's task forces is so large that no one in Atlanta, Washington, or Plains knows it off-hand.</span></p> <p><span>\"The term 'task force' is actually a misnomer,\" says Schwartz.  \"These task forces are not really committees, they do not produce white papers, they tend to be low-visibility--pools of individuals with expertise in various areas.\"</span></p> <p><span>That seems to be the beauty of the Carter task force operation.  Carter can simultaneously give the appearance of breaking the insidious Harvard-Washington nexus while still involving unprecedented numbers of Harvard people on his task forces and advisory panels.</span></p> <p><span>The experience of several Harvard faculty members whose support has been sought by the Carter-Mondale ticket tends to corroborate the notion that Carter is not only avoiding sole reliance on one institution, but he is also shunning long-term commitments to his campaign advisors.  There are few, if any individuals, from Harvard or elsewhere, who are currently earmarked for \"automatic\" Carter administration appointments.</span></p> <p><span>The entire Carter advisory operation to date is described by Schwartz as \"building Rolodex files which provide instant access to a funnel of expertise.\"</span></p> <p><span>Milton Katz, Stimson Professor of Law, has perhaps a longer standing commitment to the Carter campaign than anyone from Harvard currently involved in advising the ticket.  He has been serving in what he describes as \"a general advisory capacity\" to Carter since September, 1975, and had been in touch with Carter by mail several months before that.</span></p> <p><span>\"Last September, Jimmy came to my house for dinner,\" Katz explains.  In July, Jimmy reciprocated by inviting Katz to his large scale foreign policy briefing session in Plains, Georgia.  Katz, who is the chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Carnegie Endowment for International-relations-oriented organizations, was one of only two Harvard faculty members invited to Plains for any of the briefing sessions.  (The other was Robert Pastor, a research assistant at the Center for International Affairs.)</span></p> <p><span>The complete list of those invited to Plains, in fact, reads more like a comprehensive guide to American academicians and researchers than excerpts from a Harvard course.</span></p> <p><span>\"A good many people during the early scramble were associated with other candidates,\" says Katz.  \"In some cases it [the relative absence of any Harvard Plains-invitees] is accidental; in some cases it represents a feeling that the Carter people want to have a broad representative group.</span></p> <p><span>Schwartz concurs:  \"The Carter campaign is just filled with old Harvard people, including myself.  We've tried to break out of the traditional pattern, although we still have a preponderance from the places you'd expect.\"</span></p> <p><span>Abram Chayes '43, professor of Law, the director of George McGovern's foreign policy task forces in 1972, says he was appointed to Carter's foreign policy group partly because he supported Carter in the Massachusetts primary.  (Not many others did.)</span></p> <p><span>Chayes, who met with Carter during his brief campaign swing through Massachusetts prior to this state's Democratic primary in March, says he's \"sure a lot of these people will find their way down to Washington,\" but quickly adds, \"I expect to be here for a long, long time.\"</span></p> <p><span>Alan Dershowitz, professor of Law, received a note from Carter last year praising the contents of his article in The New York Times on criminal justice.</span></p> <p><span>Dershowitz, who is an outspoken advocate of broad changes in the nation's criminal justice system, was later appointed the coordinator of Carter's task force on crime.</span></p> <p><span>Dershowitz says few Harvard representatives are in Carter's highest advisory ranks largely because \"Harvard wasn't overly enthusiastic about the Carter candidacy early on.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Harvard is always much too represented in these things,\" Dershowitz says.  \"It's marvelously refreshing to see some brilliant people from elsewhere involved.\"</span></p> <p><span>Neither Dershowitz nor Katz could predict whether his key advisory role would ultimately result in a Washington appointment.  Dershowitz was emphatic in expressing the desire to remain in Cambridge.  (\"If my participation succeeds in helping them during the campaign though, that's fine.\")</span></p> <p><span>The search for Carter advisors, Schwartz says, culminated in \"tapping the newer people--identifying the women and the young thinkers and bringing them in.\"</span></p> <p><span>Dorothy S. Zinberg, a research associate in the Program for Science and International Affairs and an assistant professor of Psychology, is a member of Carter's science policy task force.</span></p> <p><span>\"All in all, I feel very positive about my involvement so far,\" she says.  \"I am so committed to the goals Carter has, I'm willing to work even if the personal gain for me is zero.\"</span></p> <p><span>Despite her enthusiastic support for Carter's ideals, however, Zinberg does express some reservations about the way they may be implemented.</span></p> <p><span>\"I do think that I am part of the affirmative action delegation, although I think he is genuinely committed to bringing in women, and tapping their resources,\" she says.</span></p> <p><span>Zinberg worries that much of the 600,000-plus pages of science policy recommendations already generated by her task force may never see the light of the day.</span></p> <p><span>\"We'll just have to wait and see if there isn't just one big paper shredder at the end of the pipeline,\" she says.</span></p> <p><span>Zinberg, like virtually all of her colleagues in the Carter advisory camp, does not envision any expansion of her present role after a victory in November.</span></p> <p><span>\"I can assure you,\" she says.  \"I'll still be at 9' Div Avenue.\"</span></p> <p><span>Zinberg has been called upon by the Carter forces to draft a paper on her interpretation of the function of science education, to critique a report on issues confronting scientists which task force coordinator Lewis Branscomb, IBM's vice president and chief scientist, drafted, and to participate in a science briefing with the Democratic candidate before he debates President Ford.</span></p> <p><span>Her role in the advisory effort so far stands in contrast to that of fellow science policy task force member Harvey Brooks, McKay Professor of Applied Physics.</span></p> <p><span>So far, Brooks says, his involvement has been limited to a couple of phone conversations with Branscomb, and subsequent invitations to submit papers on science policy.  Brooks has not yet taken Branscomb up on any of those invitations, but he says his role may expand as the campaign continues.</span></p> <p><span>Charles Haar, Brandeis Professor of Law, is the coordinator of the housing and land use task force, one of the few advisory panels that has actually convened as a group.</span></p> <p><span>Haar, who met with Carter two weeks ago, says he is encouraged by the amount of input his group has been granted thus far, although \"they haven't taken everything we've recommended into consideration.\"</span></p> <p><span>Marcia Guttentag, lecturer on Education, is a member of Carter's health task force, and has helped draft policy recommendations for the increased involvement of women in the field of mental health.  Guttentag terms her role a \"continuing involvement\" with the Carter-Mondale ticket, and adds that she is \"very impressed by their very systematic effort to locate women with important skills throughout the country.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Carter has been going after people who can deliver substantively, not based on place of origin,\" she adds, \"and he has shown great taste.\"</span></p> <p><span>Martin Feldstein, professor of Economics and a member of Carter's economic policy task force, says he believes that the role that all the task forces play in the formulation of policy initiatives will diminish as the campaign wears on.</span></p> <p><span>\"There will have to be more time for campaigning, and less time for drafting position papers,\" he says.</span></p> <p><span>Feldstein is more definite than many of his colleagues on the role he feels task force members will play in a Carter-Mondale administration.  \"If the ticket wins, they'll have several people to help work on their policy; there will be jobs for a number of permanent staff members,\" he explains.</span></p> <p><span>It is clear that no one in Cambridge is openly lusting after an advisory position in the Carter administration.  Tacit in virtually all Harvard-Carter advisors' statements concerning their own futures with Carter is the understanding that Carter seems to want to remain without strings at least for now.  If he really is beholden to no one, he would in all probability select his closest advisors from the ranks of those from whose help he has profited most during the campaign.</span></p> <p><span>\"I take it for granted that Carter, a man of the people, would like to draw on as wide a selection of people as possible in his campaign,\" explains Katz.</span></p> <p><span>And if you can extrapolate from what appears to be the prevailing sentiment in the Carter camp these days, there probably won't be busloads of Harvard faculty members making the jaunt down to Washington next January.</span></p> <p><span>In the meantime, as Zinberg puts it, \"a lot of people used to be getting deference and action who don't now; but everybody is working, and I feel very positive about it.\"</span></p>"}

To begin with, the Lions' sky-blue flag atop Harvard Stadium was fluttering at half-mast as their game against the Crimson kicked off across the street at the Business School field.</span></p> <p><span>Then, Columbia discovered their star forward, Fred Sock, who moves like a \"whistling chaser\" firecracker, would be marked one-on-one by Matt Bowyer.  Throughout the game, the Lions could not buy a break from the refs.  And on top of all that, there was this guy Nelson.</span></p> <p><span>A sophomore returning from a leave of absence, Lee Nelson came off the bench Saturday to spark a rusty Crimson offense to a pair of goals as Harvard picked up a 2-1 victory in its season opener.</span></p> <p><span>Before coach George Ford substituted the unknown Nelson into the game midway through a boring first half, the play had wandered back and forth and was somewhat sloppy.  Ho hum, Crimson goalie Fred Herold had made three or four great saves, but that was to be expected of the talented junior.  Chris Saunders was moving the ball well behind the Harvard forward line, but few solid scoring chances developed.  The crisp passing game Ford would like to see from his players had, for the most part, turned a bit soggy.</span></p> <p><span>Midfielder-forward Nelson would have no part of that.  With less than five minutes remaining in the lackluster half, Nelson picked up a loose ball at midfield and slipped between two Columbia midfielders.  With Ford screaming \"work left!\"  from the sidelines, Nelson pinpointed a pass down the left wing to a sprinting Lyman Bullard, who had been ineffective through the first 40 minutes.  No one, including the Columbia fullbacks and goalie, seemed to see Mike Lohrer sprinting towards the goalmouth from the right wing.</span></p> <p><span>No one, that is, except Bullard, who beat his man, saved the ball on the endline and crossed to the charging Lohrer.  Lohrer drilled the ball home from point blank range at 42:20 and, in the same motion, launched into a joyous victory leap.  Across the street at Harvard Stadium, the Columbia flag still hung listlessly at half-mast as the first gun sounded.</span></p> <p><span>The Columbia players were not about to hang listlessly in the second half, though.  Fifteen minutes into the period, the Lions started to get hungry on offense.  Sock broke loose from Bowyer and apparently had Crimson goalkeeper Herold at his mercy from close range when sweeper George Grassby bowled Sock over in an attempted tackle.</span></p> <p><span>The Lions roared for a tripping call and a penalty kick, but they received only blank expressions from the referees in return.  Suffering a stiff leg from the incident, Sock lost the edge on his speed for the rest of the game.  With Sock injured and Herold repelling Columbia charge after Columbia charge, Lohrer's goal looked plumper and plumper as the half progressed.</span></p> <p><span>Ah, but Nelson was eager to fatten up the Crimson lead.  Two-thirds of the way through the period, he leapt high for a head ball and then the ensuing rebound.  The second header bounded away, but Nelson charged forward as a Columbia midfielder was winding up to kick, took the sailing ball on his torso and burst upfield.</span></p> <p><span>After carrying the ball past two defenders, Nelson found himself in a two-on-one rush with co-captain Bullard.  Cutting inside, Nelson slipped a pass to his right for Bullard, who noticed the goalie out of the goal mouth and rocketed a shot across the goal mouth into the upper left corner of the nets at 32:10.</span></p> <p><span><b>Kudos</b></span></p> <p><span>\"That was super!\"  Bullard said after the game.  \"Lee gave me two just beautiful passes.\"  The two goals held up for the victory as Sock scored from close in at 35:00 for the single Lion tally.</span></p> <p><span>\"The first game is always a little nervous,\" Ford said after the contest, \"and this is the worst game for me.  But the defense was fantastic, and I'm glad it turned out as it did.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"We were a little lucky to get out of that,\" Bullard said.  \"We were a little rusty, but everything came together well.\"</span></p> <p><span>As the players strode slowly off the field, Columbia's flag was waving gloriously at rusty, but everything came together well.\"</span></p> <p><span>As the players strode slowly off the field, Columbia's flag was waving gloriously at full mast for the first time all day.

Wallace himself was not here.  Most delegates to this year's convention felt he had 'sold out to the pointy-headed bureaucrats' by endorsing Jimmy Carter.  But his legacy remained, and that, combined with rumors of a rising conservative tide, gave the convention some respectability as it opened.</span></p> <p><span>The gathering was to be a coalition of the already-think ranks of third party conservatives.  The fat-cat, somber-looking pin-striped remnants of the Reagan crusade, shunned by the Republican Party in Kansas City, were here to build a 'New Majority' on the structure of the American Independent Party.

North Carolina Senator Jesse Helms, New Hampshire Governor Meldrim Thomson, Illinois Congressman Phillip Crane--none set foot in the Hilton.

But Morris was not equal to the task of creating a \"New Majority,\" and the rank and file AIP members prevailed with one of their own, someone who had \"labored in the vineyards,\" former Georgia governor Lester Maddox.</span></p> <p><span>\"The kooks won,\" said the chairman of the Young Americans for Freedom as Maddox snared the nomination, dashing any hopes for conservative unity this fall.  And so the articulate smoothies of the Right took their money, donor lists, and relatively rational following and left Chicago a day early--their hopes buried in a large pile of Lester Maddox's racially symbolic pickhandles--pickhandles with which Maddox had little hope of denting fellow Georgian Jimmy Carter's armor.</span></p> <p><span>As that scenario materialized, I began to understand that this convention was more a cultural gathering than a political one--Windy City softball when lined up against the hard-hitting major parties.  The questions it raised were not questions of pragmatism or power but questions of an almost anthropological sort.  Some could be raised by F. Scott Fitzgerald.  Just how were the \"kooks,\" like the rich, different from you and me?  Were some of these people not 'kooks?'  Where did strongly held principles leave off and 'kookism' begin?  What were its manifestations?</span></p> <p><span>I set out in search of the kookism in its various degrees, determined to record the rhetoric and perversities that gave life to this bush league convention.</span></p> <p><span>***</span></p> <p><span>It's Wednesday evening and Homer Marquis is an early arrival Illinois delegate.  He talks about Communist control of the Democratic and Republican parties.  He asks just how much I know about \"that Council on Foreign Relations they got doin' all those evil things.\"  Homer can't tell me his hometown because \"those bastards will come and throw stones at my house.\"  Questions about the identify of the 'bastards' go unanswered.  \"I'm saying all this to help you, young fella,\" he explains, gripping my shoulder and asking for my address, so as to pass along some literature about Jimmy Carter's cocaine connection.</span></p> <p><span>Mrs. William Gordon of Nebraska, who declines to give her own first name, wastes no time in getting to the point.  Rockefeller and Kissinger are at the top of many delegates' pariah lists and she is no exception.  Rocky, she says, is running the country and the world through his international Zionist organization that operates in cahoots with the Rothschilds in France and royalty in the Netherlands.  \"They meet once a year in unknown places.\"  Agents include Kissinger and Carter, and now that Reagan has joined the Council on Foreign Relations, Mrs. Gordon is not so sure about him.  Furthermore, the Rockefellers are Jewish and have changed their name many times over the years.</span></p> <p><span>She adds that 'Rosen and Felt' were responsible for the death of J. Edgar Hoover.</span></p> <p><span>Later in the week, these and other similar charges will become more than the mere frothings of a few delegates when John Couture, a member of the convention committee, says in his keynote address that Zionism is the \"most insidious, far-reaching, murderous force the world has ever known,\" and that it \"started two world wars\" and is ready for a third.</span></p> <p><span>Jack Dembrowski and Bernie Shannon of Stoughton, Massachusetts, don't buy all that stuff.  \"I only go so far down the road, then I take a left and they take a right,\" jocular Bernie says.</span></p> <p><span>Both Bernie and Jack say they are basically Democrats.  Jack claims he drove 400 miles to President Kennedy's funeral; he voted for McGovern because he opposed the war.  Bernie was a great admirer of Bobby.  But now Jack is running Bernie's campaign against Edward Kennedy in the Massachusetts senatorial primary.</span></p> <p><span>\"When we (immigrants) came over we didn't expect to be taken care of, fed from the golden calf,\" Jack says, and Bernie notes that Teddy Kennedy has inverted his brother's 'Ask not...' philosophy.  Jack figures while he's in town he might get in touch with Jesse Jackson, whom he admires for what he sees as his anti--handout mentality.  Both delegates feel blacks should be included in the party so as to broaden its base, but, as the events of the week soon prove, these views go unheeded.</span></p> <p><span>Some of the other positions they hold, however, are shared by fellow delegates, and as I sit and talk at length with Bernie, Jack and Daniel Eller, a former professor of Music at Eastern Michigan University who quit because of the \"Marxist orientation of the department,\" I learn if there is one issue that really drives them it's the pro-life movement.</span></p> <p><span>Jack talks of Chicago's Mayor Daley and points out that until he got into town that morning he thought the Mayor was a good man.  But as he got off the plane and picked up a newspaper he realized that Daley, in criticizing Cardinal Cody for his stand in favor of an anti-abortion amendment, was not committed to the right to life.  \"This is the most important decision since slavery,\" Jack, a lawyer says, comparing the 1973 Supreme Court decision on abortion to the infamous Dred Scott case in which a black slave was held to be the property of his owner.  \"This issue will be the rise and fall of many,\" Bernie says, because \"abortion is a denial of the Judeo-Christian emphasis of the Founding Fathers.  They assumed that those who interpreted the law would be of this ethic.  The Human Life Amendment will be the last great document of Western Civilization--like God speaking the Abraham, the Magna Carta, the Bill of Rights, the Emancipation Proclamation.\"</span></p> <p><span>There is no venom, just passion, and throughout the week we remain friends.  Like others, Bernie and Jack leave the convention when Maddox is nominated.</span></p> <p><span>***</span></p> <p><span>GOD RIGHTS YOU CONSTITUTION GOVERNMENT</span></p> <p><span>\"It took two years for me to design that model,\" Arman Mohtz '62 tells me, asking that I pay careful attention to the fact that 'government' is in a box and at the bottom.  Mohtz likes to think of himself as a 'constitutionalist' rather than a conservative.  Like many other delegates, he totes several copies of the Constitution around with him at all times.  He opens one.  \"Congress shall make no law abridging...\" Mohtz, a squat little man, gets excited.  \"That limitation's not on you, not on me, it's on Congress.\"  He tells me of his campaign for Congress in 1974 when he ran under the slogan:  \"Get the bureaucrat's hands out of your pocket and nose out of your business.\"  But that part of his life is all over.  Now he helps run the United States Taxpayers Union and plans for a tax strike.</span></p> <p><span>Mohtz recalls that he first became disenchanted with Harvard when he took courses on the Far East from John Fairbank '29, Higginson:  Professor of History.  Fairbank attacked General Douglas MacArthur and Mohtz objected.  \"What I thought then was proved in the '50s, of course,\" Mohtz says, noting that Fairbank was cited as a Communist sympathizer.</span></p> <p><span>Before leaving, I asked Mohtz if he had any contact with Harvard anymore.  Not since he discovered that half Harvard's trustees were on 'The Council,' he said.</span></p> <p><span>The discussion drifts to Harvard, where he graduated as a Biology major.  He asks if I know anything about the politics of the department there and I tell him of the debate between those who believe behavioral traits are inherited and others who say such things are determined by one's environment.  \"You mean totalitarianism vs. liberty,\" Mohtz says.  I dare not ask which is which but it soon becomes apparent he believes only totalitarians try to mold people contrary to the designs of their souls.</span></p> <p><span>Thursday the convention opens.  I secure a press pass but it doesn't mean much.  No one guards the door to the convention hall itself and press conferences are punctured by partisan applause and arguments between non-media onlookers and the speaker.  The press is amused for a time, but by week's end tires of the circus.</span></p> <p><span>I move over to talk to the chairman of the Illinois delegation, Harold Wilber, a real estate subdivider.  Wilber fills me in on the split in the Illinois movement between the American Independent and the American Independence Parties.  Both are here together today, however, even though their combined petitions are not enough to get a candidate on the Illinois ballot.  Wilber looks forward to a court ruling on a ballot suit brought by Gene McCarthy and hopes the decision will help them too.  Later in the week, a decision is handed down in favor of McCarthy but does not apply directly to the AIP.  Nonetheless, Illinois delegates and others have nothing but kind words for the third party efforts of their strange bedfellow, that pied piper of 1968.</span></p> <p><span>As Wilber begins to tell me of his admiration for Calvin Coolidge (Herbert Hoover was another convention favorite), his wife appears and asks about a man who has just walked into the hotel and wants to be a delegate.  Wilber instructs her to have him pay his money, sign in, and wait for some brief questioning.  Convention officials make no secret of any of this.  The next day, when the roll call for president reaches Maine, a debate between the state chairman and convention secretary ensues over whether Maine has paid $100 each for the number of delegates they claim.</span></p> <p><span>But this is the first day of the convention and the delegates are excited:  waving flags, crying \"hear!  hear!\", reveling in a pale imitation of the pageantry of a real national convention.  'Register Kissinger not Firearms,' 'The Rock Owns a Piece of Me,' and 'Don't Re-elect Anybody' bumper stickers; dead-babies' ingarbage-cans armbands; plastic gold noose lapel pins (for 'Public Officials convicted for treason'); pistol tie clips, etc., etc.</span></p> <p><span>The speeches contained few surprises.  The anti-gun control, anti-busing, anti-abortion, anti-ERA, anti-homosexuality, anti-big government platform is predictable enough.  Someone wants the telephone tax removed as an infringement of free speech; revenue sharing, foreign aid, and the graduated income tax get canned; the Maddox people condemn the 55 mph speed limit as unconstitutional--standard conservative fare in sum, but proof that the creative reactionary is still alive and well.</span></p> <p><span>On this day, the gut issues are discussed.  Woody Jenkins of Louisiana reminds the audience of the four great American protections:  \"the soap box, the ballot box, the jury box and the cartridge box.  If you ever lose the cartridge box, the other three won't mean a thing.\"  He recalls that the Japanese decided not to invade the West Coast in World War II because they knew the futility of doing battle with an armed citizenry.</span></p> <p><span>Young Janine Hansen of Nevada decries ERA as a plot to destroy the family.  Her family is a significant one at this convention--they make up five of the nine members of the Nevada delegation.  Soon, it becomes apparent that this is representative of much of the convention--a gathering of family and friends active in this sort of thing since the Wallace crusade of 1968 and resentful of highbrow outsiders from the aborted Reagan campaign.</span></p> <p><span>Colonel John Warnock of Arkansas rises to address the convention on the subject of 'America in Jeopardy.'  Chief Justice Earl Warren was \"the worst thing that ever happened\" to the United States.  \"When he lay in state in the Supreme Court building\" Warnock thundered, \"over one million Negroes were in walking distance but only 300 showed up to pay their respects.\"  He goes on to bemoan the fact that there are \"500,000 people in Chicago who don't even speak English\" and lament that \"the more mixed blood in hospitals, the more hepatitis there will be.\"</span></p> <p><span>At the end of the session, a short period is allowed for delegates to sound off.  (AIP-members pride themselves on being democratic, although many will not use the word because \"the Founding Fathers did not.\")  Michael Jacobs, a delegate from Vermont, objects to the racial overtones of Colonel Warnock's remarks and notes that such overtones will harm the party's efforts to broaden its base.  \"How many niggers you got in Vermont?\"  a man shouts out.  I peer over at the only black face in the room--that of a young security guard.  He remains impassive.  A burly, slightly drunk Ohioan goes to the microphone to make his contribution.  \"The Panama Canal is as much ours as Alaska or the Louisiana Purchase...  We should make it the 51st state.\"</span></p> <p><span>Outside the convention hall, former Louisiana Congressman John Rarick holds an impromptu press conference.  Leaning on one leg and looking very cocky in his white shoes and gray, dry-look pompadour, Rarick, who gained a reputation as one of the most anti-Semitic men in Congress, discusses his hopes to run as an AIP candidate for president and Congress simultaneously in November.  A reporter from the Boston Globe raises the possibility that such a move might be illegal.  Rarick looks puzzled and says he hasn't considered that.  Another question.  Busing.  Ah yes!  A smile.  If Catholics and Protestants were to be successfully bused in Northern Ireland, Arabs and Israelis in the Mid-East, and Turks and Greeks on Cyprus--then Rarick might consider accepting busing in this country.</span></p> <p><span>Friday is the big day.  Maddox struts into a press conference, proclaims \"I am a segregationist,\" calls Carter \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,\" and argues with a black reporter about white rule in South Africa.</span></p> <p><span>Over a drink up in the one-typewriter, one-telephone press room, Ned Young, Maddox's campaign director (\"'manager' sounds too offensive\") tells me the real story behind the pickhandle legend.  \"The Governor used to own a place called the Pickrick Restaurant and the handles were sold as souvenirs--4000 in two days one time--like those rocks they sell.\"  I begin comparing the little innocuous pet rocks I know with the famed pickhandles and what I had heard about them when Young interrupted my thoughts to remind me once again that there was nothing symbolic about the pickhandle.  \"He never actually wielded a pickhandle, now did he?\"  Young asks.  \"You ever seen a picture of that?\"  I had to confess that I hadn't, although I did remember a photo of Maddox wielding a gun when chasing blacks away from his restaurant.</span></p> <p><span>Young goes on to discuss Jimmy Carter's attitude toward Maddox when the latter served under Carter as lieutenant governor.  \"Carter sent word for Maddox to come see him after the inauguration.  He said, 'I need no assistance from you whatsoever.  If you oppose the governor's office, we will destroy you.'\"</span></p> <p><span>I head upstairs to where Maddox is scheduled to address several midwestern delegations.  The elevator fills up and an elderly man shoots me a quick \"Hello young fella.\"  I bait him.  \"Mr. Maddox, what would you have done if this was 1968 and there were demonstrators downstairs?\"  \"I think Mayor Daley did the right thing,\" Lester Maddox says, emerging from the elevator to tell the crowd \"regardless of where everyone else stands today, I'll still be Lester Maddox tomorrow.\"</span></p> <p><span>Maddox delegate Louis Kuynyo shifts from one foot to another as a boyish Fatty Arbuckle at his side snaps Maddox's picture.  \"I just cross my fingers we don't have another Wallace on our hands,\" Kuynyo' whispers.</span></p> <p><span>Downstairs, one of the natty Reaganite interlopers, Howard Phillips '62, beckons me over to talk.  Phillips, a bright and articulate man who helped found the Young Americans for Freedom shortly after leaving Harvard, is a former director of the Office of Economic Opportunity.  He claims to have convinced Nixon to dismantle OEO but became disenchanted upon discovering that the Administration was not as committed as he to ending such federal programs.  Phillips believes that federal funds are presently being used for welfare rights organizations, gay liberation, rent strikes and so forth.  Most Americans are \"common sense, non-ideological conservatives,\" he says, \"They are patriotic, concerned about national defense, worried about inflation and a balanced budget.\"  But most conservatives, according to Phillips, are Democrats; thus the movement can't work through the Republican Party.  \"They have to know you're not Watergate and Herbert Hoover,\" he explains.  Hence the new party attempt at the AIP convention.</span></p> <p><span>Phillips admits failure for the time being.  Now is just not the time for this clan.  The AIP isn't ready for an assault from the outside.  Party Chairman William Shearer likens the AIP to a girl \"targeted for a rape that didn't come off.\"  By morning all of them--Phillips, Rusher, Viguerie, Morris--have packed their Brooks Brothers suits and disappeared.</span></p> <p><span>Inside the hall, I cruise past the two-man \"state caucuses,\" past the gentleman who hopes to be elected President by convincing representatives of the electoral college to vote for him (as they are constitutionally able to do), past a stars and stripes costume on the body of an elderly woman.  She carries flags of the United States and of Texas.  Her name is Margaret Mathews and she claims to be the great-granddaughter of Alexander Stephens, vice-president of the Confederacy.  We discuss the Civil War at some length.  She has two 40-foot flag poles which stand outside her home in Cut-N-Shoot, Texas.  On one flies Old Glory; on the other the Confederate flag flying over the emblem of the Lone Start State.</span></p> <p><span>The prospective nominees begin their final pitches forvotes Morris babbles incoherently; Rarick divided the nation into two kinds of people:  \"Americans and one-world internationalists\"; Maddox dismisses those who don't like his image.  \"The radicals don't, the anarchists don't, the dope-pushers don't, the Communist Russians don't, the agitators don't.\"</span></p> <p><span>Balloting begins without Alabama--no one from that state has shown up.  \"Madame Secretary, Nebraska...which commends New Hampshire and its governor Meldrim<jtp>\n</jtp></span></p>"}
{"title": "Stand-Off at the Stadium | Sports | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The Colonial meat-packing company proved over the weekend to be the only group of people who can play both sides of the Yankee-Red Sox blood feud.  Effervescent kids on New York's channel 11, largely black and Hispanic, touted Yankee Franks as \"the taste that takes you out to the ballgame,\" while a similar, but whiter, group of urchins acted out the same theme between innings for Fenway Franks.</span></p> <p><span>Little else about the four-game split in Yankee Stadium brought people together.  After the seventh inning brawl in the Thursday opener, there were few objective observers in the ballpark, and probably fewer still in the bars of the two cities.  Excluding, maybe, the police who had to break up the numerous and sometimes bloody fights in the stands that followed the main event on the field.</span></p> <p><span>Bill Lee, the Boston starter, had staggered off the field a victim of the brawl, looking dazed and crippled even from the oxygen-mask territory of the upper deck.  About a third of the Stadium crowd, far more than had earlier expressed Beantown loyalty, cheered Rick Burleson's ensuing two-run homer that began what ended as an 8-2 Bosox rout.</span></p> <p><span>Even the Bronx native and lifetime New Yorker sitting next to me started rooting for the Olde Towne Team after the grounded Spaceman exited.  New Yorkers, are like that, I guess, possessed with an urge to hero worship, but without the patience to develop tested team loyalty.  (Another companion at the game, also a Big Apple native, confessed that his childhood adulation of the Detroit TIgers had ended completely when A1 Kaline retired.)</span></p> <p><span>The loud, and inarticulate, Yankee partisans sitting behind me seemed able to get really excited only when they could combine a Red Sox nickname with an epithet, like \"Pudge, you stiff.\"  With the possible exceptions of Catfish Hunter, Thurman Munson, and for unfathomable reasons, Lou Piniella, the Yankee players (who seem by and large to lack nicknames) have not caught the fancy of the city.  Like Jimmy Carter, the Yankees' support is a mile wide but maybe only an inch deep.</span></p> <p><span>The new Yankees are built on speed, and run they did on Carlton Fisk's suddenly questionable arm.  Leading the way was highly-accoladed rookie second baseman Willie Randolph, who already looks like Joe Morgan and has the same sense of control and presence on the field.</span></p> <p><span>But the scrappy, hustling game that the Yankees now play seems out of tune in the new Yankee Stadium, which still seems magisterial and, somehow, important.  But, for my two cents' worth, the renovated version doesn't merit its $100 million price tag.  A $5 ticket in the new, \"unobstructed view\" stadium still did not afford a glimpse of half of right field.</span></p> <p><span>The steeply-tiered upper deck, which rises at least to the level of a Triple-A pop-up, puts one far above the action, an appropriate distance in a shrine, perhaps, but one that allows even Yankee partisans to concentrate exclusively on the fights in the stands and not on their team batting below.  But one can't help feeling that they would have watched Ruth or Dimaggio or Mantle take their swings in the circumstances.</span></p> <p><span>After Thursday, the series assumed an eerie calm.  No one on either team seemed interested in renewing the aggressions of the opener's fisticuffs.  Graig Nettles, one of the protagonists in the assault on Lee, was hit by a pitch on Saturday night.  But it was in the bottom of the tenth, and the pitch was so obviously an errant curve ball that Nettles didn't even glare back at the pitcher, Tom House.  It was like that through the Yankee victory on Friday and the Bosox's recovery Sunday.  Both teams clawed at each other like cats with manners, scoring in dribs and drabs and putting together scratch singles and errors most of the time, with the tension but not the screeching of Thursday.  Saturday was a little different; the Catfish lived up to <i>his</i> price tag, scattering three hits in 11 innings before the Yankees finally broke through the sturdy pitching of Dick Pole and Tom House for a run.</span></p> <p><span>* * *</span></p> <p><span>But it would be stretching a point to say that the Yankees yet have much class.  Their convicted-felon owner, George Steinbrenner, told Yankee broadcaster Frank Messer that he wanted Lee suspended from baseball for telling a New Jersey paper that he was looking forward to returning to action and \"drilling\" Nettles and Mickey Rivers, the two members of the Yankees who almost ended the Space Cowboy's career--a natural feeling on Lee's part, it seems to me.</span></p> <p><span>Steinbrenner doesn't like fights, though.  He refused to let the Stadium, a public facility, be used for a Frazier-Foreman fight this summer because it would allegedly tear up the infield grass too much.  The fight promoter then told the press that Steinbrenner wore a toupee.  So the Yankee owner, concerned by this assault on his image, told the broadcaster on Sunday to pull his hair to \"see if it is a purple wig.\"  The Yankee-paid Messer dutifully announced that it \"feels real to me,\" as the camera focused on the Yankee team taking the field.</span></p> <p><span>Just for the record, Yankee Franks cost 65 cents in the Stadium, while Fenway Franks go for 55 cents.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Gnashed Teeth | Sports | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Along with the invention of inflatable teenage love dolls and 'moral obligation' bonds, big time wrestling will be remembered as one of the great achievements of our civilization.  Big time wrestling is the most relevant sport known to mankind:  in no other arena will you find the issues of our time being resolved before your very eyes.  Racism, witchcraft, obesity, detente and the energy crisis all work their way into this most realistic of sports.</span></p> <p><span>But for the moment let's forget all this theoretical crap and get down to the interesting stuff.  There are a lot of evil minded gossip mongers--some of whom, you might be interested to know, are paid by <i>foreign governments</i> for their troubles--who claim that America's professional wrestlers are a bunch of beer-bellied longshoremen too washed up to take on any other work.  Well, my friends, let's put that myth to rest right now.  The men and women in big time wrestling are the most superbly conditioned athletes <i>in the world.</i>  This fact may be ascertained in any technical manual on human biology, and has been documented by the Defense Department's classified file on manpower emergencies.  You might not think that the McGuire twins, Billie and Bennie (whose combined weight exceeds 1300 pounds, and who have to wear custom built undershorts to keep their stomachs from banging against their knees) would be much in the speed department, but recent tests performed at a Utah laboratory prove that they are the equal of any Olympic sprinter in speed and agility.</span></p> <p><span>America was humiliated at the Munich Olympics when Chris Taylor, the 400-plus pound lug who had flopped his way into America's heart, was torn to pieces by a sneaky little Russian half his weight (it is no coincidence that late August-early September is marked by historians as the time that detente turned in the Russians' favor); but Chris Taylor is nothing compared to America's greatest Wrestlers.  He hasn't even been able to break into the top ten contenders list for the west coast, which is the easiest of all the professional wrestling conferences.  The likes of Man Mountain Mike or Pedro Morales could easily win the Olympic wrestling medal--or any other Olympic medal, for that matter!  It is a fair bet, in my opinion, that a dozen or so big time wrestlers could win the World Series, the Super Bowl, or any of the other titles in those other boring, unrealistic sports.</span></p> <p><span>Racism Buffs:  Does heredity influence one's position in life?  Some say yes, some say no, but it is an undeniable fact that big time wrestling boasts a disproportionate number of Kings, Princes and other noblemen.  Lord Al Hays, Sir Dudley Clements, Lord James Blears, and a dozen others have actually served or are predicted to serve in England's House of Lords.  The Great Mephisto and The Shiek, both prominent leaders in the Middle East, have brought to the sport that touch of subtlety and mystique associated with their native land.</span></p> <p><span>Some say big time wrestling is fake, but as any half serious student of the sport can tell you, it is highly scientific.  Many holds, such as Tarzan Tyler's atomic skullcrusher and the Mongolian Stompers' \"claw\", rely on the findings of the likes of Einstein.  Others, such as George The Animal Steel's heart stopper, could not be applied without an intimate knowledge of biology.  Although this is a little known fact, many former astronauts--who are among the smartest and most scientific men in America--are now professional wrestlers under assumed names.</span></p> <p><span>Those of you who have read this far are very lucky, for I am now going to reveal to you a fact unknown to dozens of the nation's cleverest political pundits.  About 15 years ago there was a chunk of malicious fat which managed to waddle its way out of the central scrublands of Georgia.  Its name:  Crusher Blackwell, all 572 pounds of it.  Crusher used to make a fool of himself in front of television cameras by singing ridiculous little jungles like \"Jingle bells, jingle bells, I'm gonna stomp Sammartino's head flat.\"  Often he would forget these pathetic rhymes when he was only half way through them.  Blackwell was unpopular from his first bout onwards, but despite his unpopularity he drew enormous crowds and was therefore able to charge an enormous price for performing.  He retired to Plains, Ga., to raises peanuts.  That was about ten years ago.  Well, in this bicentennial year, peanuts and Plains, Ga., ring a bell?  Damn right it does:  that's Jimmy Carter's occupation and home town.  A coincidence?  Hardly.  Crusher's friends admit that he has lost more than four hundred pounds, shaved his beard, and dyed his hair blond.  But they say you can still tell him by his smile.  Figure it out for yourselves, my friends.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Ideologue of the Reaction | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>A</b>MERICANS COULD HAVE hoped that the defeat of an interventionist U.S. by the Vietnamese would at last put an end to a long tradition of foreign policy megalomania--the idea that the nation was embarking on a crusade for world-wide \"democracy\" and that we should somehow want or be entitled to \"raise Manila, up, up, up, until it is just like Kansas City.\"  The U.S. ambassador to Saigon departed Viet Nam the way he would have entered 20 years before, in a helicopter from the embassy roof between rounds of NLF artillery fire.  The image of a fleeing Graham Martin should have taught us a hard truth:  that no matter how much we talked about indigenous liberal \"democratic\" elements in underdeveloped countries, and regardless of how much our bombadeers tried to convey the superiority of the free enterprise system, the people of one nation, and probably others, weren't convinced.  In the aftermath, President Ford called for a defeat without recrimination, which meant that the best the responsible elites could hope for was to escape the \"tragic error\" without blame.</span></p> <p><span>An ideological crisis, not quite capable of suppression, thus haunts our polity.  Even if the U.S. <i>can</i> force the rest of the world to love our brand of democracy--dubious after Viet Nam--do our people have the stomach to support terrorist means to achieve libertarian ends?  If not, those who have made foreign policy uninterruptedly since the Second World War seem to fear, then we will be reduced to a role versus the Soviets and Chinese of a \"helpless, pitiful giant.\"  Nixon, the author of that phase, and the nation's best pro football fan, would know better than anyone that we need a political Vince Lombardi to alternately stir up our people's prejudices and whip us for our cowardice.</span></p> <p><span><b>S</b>O INTO THIS crisis comes Daniel Patrick Moynihan with gung-ho junior officer's rhetoric couched in references to Yeats and Locke.  On the one hand he claims, we are the world's greatest democracy in terms of liberties and affluence--\"find its equal,\" he has written.  But Americans are also in a dangerous time, paralyzed by failure of nerve; we are threatened with our foreign policy \"elites\" making \"an accommodation to totalitarianism without precedent in our history.\"  Perhaps Nixon made his peace with Mao and Brezhnev, and detente was the order of election year 1972--but this has changed; Moynihan sees the world divided between the party of liberty and that of totalitarianism.</span></p> <p><span>The misconceptions Moynihan has foisted on an anomic public desperately wanting to believe in an American \"purpose\" are incredible.  He claimed last October 3 at an AFL-CIO convention, that Israel is hated by the third world because it is a democracy.  Moynihan did not mention the question of Palestinian refugees, the economic inequities visited on underdeveloped nations by Israel's chief backer, U.S. policy in Chile and Indo-China or the consistent support of the American government for South Africa and Rhodesia.  Moynihan's reason for third world hostility toward this country sounds like something from the American right's glory days of the early 50s:  \"Such has been the success of Communist arms, Communist intrigue, Communist treachery in Asia and Africa that the reputation of democracy in those regions has all but collapsed.\"</span></p> <p><span>Since assuming the ambassadorship to the United Nations, Moynihan has discarded the sophisticated--and more moderate--husk of his polemic, leaving the simplistic fruit intact.  In an article in the March, 1975 <i>Commentary</i> Moynihan classed the underdeveloped nations as a true third force in world politics:  They were democratic socialist, in line with a West European colonial experience.  He described these nations as by and large anti-American and redistributionist (rather than production-oriented, since he says socialism cannot be productive.  Here Moynihan forgets the Soviet Union, which is unusual if only because it seems to dominate all his other thoughts).  But these nations, according to the early Moynihan, could be wooed away from authoritarianism.  Independence from Moscow and Peking was only possible however, through the dismantling of inefficient state-managed economies and their replacement by capitalism, with plenty of opportunity--Moynihan implies--for U.S. investment.  Strangely, this is the same type of strings-attached investment that the underdeveloped world has recently claimed to distrust.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>T WASN'T NECESSARY to be a Harvard Professor of Government to develop this analysis.  Moynihan's suggested methods for implementation, also spelled out in the <i>Commentary</i> article, possibly impressed Kissinger; at any rate, Kissinger reportedly hired Moynihan on the basis of the piece.  Moynihan there proposed to aggressively defend the U.S. from third world attack, centering on Great Achievements of international liberalism--like the multinational corporation, he wrote--and blaming third world government for their own economic troubles and lack of freedoms.  We should chide those in Africa and Asia, Moynihan wrote, reminding them in a tried-and-true American way that putting liberty before equality is the way to do best by the latter.</span></p> <p><span>Faced with intransigent natives at the U.N., the great hunter must have smelled blood, his rhetoric growing increasingly incendiary and his suspicion apparently growing that every word the delegate from say, Burundi, was speaking was dictated from Moscow.  This has come to be his present stance, one which it would be wrong to take as something paralleling Kissinger's foreign policy, which is more flexible, but no less conservative in basis.  Moynihan's practice, at the UN and in the media, made and makes a difference to American foreign policy, only to the extent that it restores popular confidence in an aggressive American imperium.  The Moynihan blasts at third world despots were never designed to win over the underdeveloped countries--a few words from Moynihan would hardly send them scurrying except in the expectations of a lunatic, to sing the praises of General Motors plants, World Bank investment, and the federal system of government.  Moynihan was Kissinger's Agnew:  his role was to make it seem like America was all but isolated in the world--two dozen \"democracies\" defending \"civilization,\" as he put it, against the hordes--and that we had better pull together again to avoid the rule of the all-powerful and violent slave State, embodied in a waxing Soviet Communism.  It was all meant for domestic consumption, aiding the attempted restoration of a post-Viet Nam and post-Watergate conservatism.</span></p> <p><span>As an ideologue with popular backing Moynihan is dangerous.  As a serious theorist he is absurd:  he denounces OPEC, as is <i>de rigeur</i> on the American center-right, for its raising of oil prices and he extolls the world free market.  Yet there is no free market; monopolistic multinational corporations control international trade in manufacturing, charging inflated prices and thus adding to their profit margins.  Third world producers of food and raw materials have heretofore engaged in competition with each other to their detriment, over-producing and lowering prices for their goods.  In the 20 years between 1952 and 1972, the UN reports, prices of primary commodities (mainly from the underdeveloped countries) declined relative to manufactured products (mainly from the developed nations).  A large proportion of third world countries have thus increased their production as much or more than Western nations since 1945, but have grown relatively poorer.</span></p> <p><span><b>E</b>XPLAINING anti-Americanism by anti-democratic tides of Soviet influence washing over the third world is inadequate.  Nor is the democratic versus antidemocratic split as positively correlated with the U.S.-Soviet rivalry as Moynihan portrays it.  Military and authoritarian government by the score have been directly installed by the U.S. or remain there only because of American support; among these nations are Chile, South Korea, the Philippines, Uruguay, Brazil, Bolivia, Nicaragua, Singapore, Ghana, Guatemala, Iran, and Saudi Arabia.  Moynihan, and the type of foreign policy he represents, has no interest in parliamentary government for itself; \"democracy stands only as a code word, meaning the continued functioning of a world-wide market and system of investments, channelled through Western institutions like the World Bank, which systematically discriminate against third world countries.</span></p> <p><span>But Moynihan, though possibly the most hated man in the underdeveloped world, may well be the most admired man here.  Next month, The New York Times reported, he will probably announce his candidacy for the Senate from New York.  A small campaign has already started, portraying Moynihan as the intellectual elite's liaison (with working class background) to the workers, while Moynihan is always pointing out that organized labor of the Meany description has been longest and loudest in its condemnation of Soviet totalitarianism.  working class anger, dormant for the moment because of apathy and Wallace's paralysis, could revive again under Moynihan or some other figure--this time as the servant of a nationalist appeal meant to increase the power of the multinational corporations but satisfying popular needs for an overriding sense of meaning.  The national case of disillusion has been somewhat mitigated by the pseudo-religious politics of Carter and Jerry Brown.  A presidential campaign with or without Moynihan but based on his theme for getting tough with the rest of the world could make those guys look like straight-talkers and candy-ass idealists</span></p>"}

{"title": "Said the King to the Peanut... | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>A</b>S JIMMY CARTER'S bandwagon hits bumpy terrain, the 86 delegates Chicago's Mayor Daley holds in the name of Illinois Sen.  Adlai E. Stevenson '52 begin to look increasingly significant.  The vision of taking all those delegates in one fell swoop by choosing Stevenson as his running mate, must loom very large in Carter's mind as he creeps towards the 1505 votes needed to nominate.</span></p> <p><span>Despite their attractiveness, Sens.  Walter Mondale and Birch Bayh just don't hold strong hands in the delegate numbers game--the latter spent $1 million for one Massachusetts delegate.  Another often-mentioned vice-presidential possibility, Sen. John Glenn, of Ohio and Outer Space, is a political neophyte--something the Carter campaign abounds in--and unless the delegate situation is really desperate, constant primary bickering between Carter and Mo Udall would preclude the choice of the Arizona Congressman.  And a Carter-Jerry Brown would be unbalanced in ideology and constituency which would mean sitting this one out for many Democrats.</span></p> <p><span>This scenario, which assumes Jimmy will come out on top, leaves Stevenson as the only one remaining on the pundits' list of vice-presidential possibilities.  He provides the old venerated name for Carter's new flashy one, the establishment ties for Carter's anti-Washington constituency, the urban Midwest appeal for Carter's rural Southern one.  Most importantly, Adlai finds himself in the unique position of simultaneously representing the party bosses like Daley, plus the liberals who admire the Senator's progressive legislative record and still tingle when they remember his father's greatness.  This year the Daley wing is the more important of the two and in that sense Stevenson would represent Carter's insurance against another McGovern debacle.  After being ejected from the 1972 convention in a credentials dispute, a triumphant return by Daley would dramatize the reunification of the party's divergent elements--something Carter obviously needs.</span></p> <p><span>Looking ahead to the fall, something else Carter needs is to carry Illinois.  Every election since 1916 has found that state on the winning side, and Daley's superhuman efforts to put Illinois in Kennedy's column proved decisive in 1960 (to the chagrin of Republicans suspicious of \"ghost voting\" illegalities).  Ford is very strong in Illinois--besides Michigan it was his most significant win--so if Carter expects to come away with those 25 electoral votes, he'll need the Mayor's whole-hearted support.</span></p> <p><span>But Stevenson could help the national ticket in more general ways.  Because he realizes he lacks his father's eloquence and wit, he concentrates instead on making his speeches rhetoric-free and responsive to issues--a trait in short supply this year.  Stevenson, who some say knows the issues better than his father did, is given high marks for his performance in the Senate.  His well-recognized participation in the drafting of the aid package for New York City would help Carter in stricken urban areas and a knowledgability in foreign affairs seems to run in the family.  On energy, Stevenson is considered one of the best informed members of Congress.  These are attributes that could bring thoughtful Democrats to swallow a Carter-Stevenson ticket.</span></p> <p><span><b>S</b>O CHOOSING Stevenson makes some sense.  Whether in this strange election Carter will pay attention to what makes sense is a different question.  What Jimmy must pay heed to, however, is clout--and that's a word Richard J. Daley put in the American vocabulary.  If Daley so desires, he can bring a tremendous amount of pressure to bear on Carter to pick Stevenson.  \"Hizzoner da mare,\" as he is known to his Chicago friends, possesses hundreds of I.O.U.'s just waiting to be collected on.  For years, Democratic politicians from across the country have come hat in hand to Daley's office and one call from the kingmaker this summer could send any number of them scurrying over to talk to Jimmy about Adlai.  Ted Kennedy, for one, is willing to do just about anything Daley asks of him.  Carter understands all of this and although he is smart enough not to make any committments yet, he has been courting Daley and Stevenson for some time.  In 1974, when the Mayor had a stroke, Carter invited him to Warm Springs, Ga. to recuperate.</span></p> <p><span>Thus, in a peculiar way, the question really becomes one of what Daley wants to do, and this goes to the heart of the Daley-Stevenson relationship.  Daley likes national prestige and the extra funds for Chicago that would result from having a hometown boy in the number two spot, but in truth he probably doesn't really care very much whether or not Adlai Stevenson the man, is vice-president.</span></p> <p><span>The association between the two has not been a close one.  Daley came up the hard way--to this day he lives in the old Irish-Catholic neighborhood in back of the stock yards on Chicago's South Side.  It takes a lot of muscle to run a city like Chicago for over twenty years and that strength comes from a well-oiled patronage machine run by tough-talking, bowler-hatted ward bosses--Daley's own kind.</span></p> <p><span>Adlai Stevenson III didn't come up through the precincts.  His great-grandfather was vice-president under Grover Cleveland and in 1952, when his father first ran against Eisenhower for president, young Adlai was between his undergraduate and law school days at Harvard.  During those years, Daley never cared much for the late Governor Stevenson and many of the Mayor's lackeys adhered to the current \"Adlai the Egghead\" sentiment.  After losing twice to Eisenhower, the Mayor thought Adlai II had had enough and in 1960 he dumped him in favor of John Kennedy--quite an embarrassment to say the least.</span></p> <p><span>Daley and his power base--the Cook County Democratic Central Committee--usually determine who will represent the party statewide and in 1968 when Adlai III went before the slatemakers asking to begiven the nod to run for the Senate, Daley said no go--Stevenson was against the war.  After the bloody convention that year, Stevenson, then state treasurer, criticized the Chicago police and called the Daley machine \"feudal.\"</span></p> <p><span>But in 1970, after Everett Dirksen's death opened a Senate seat, the two made peace and their relationship is now polite, above-board and very business-like.  Stevenson needs Daley to get re-slated by the Democrats for the Senate and carry Chicago; Daley needs Stevenson to lead the state ticket and sweep in other Democratic candidates on his coattails as he did in 1970 and 1974.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>ND THAT IS exactly why Richard Daley needs Adlai Stevenson this year.  Michael Howlett, secretary of state and a Daley man, knocked off anti-Daley incumbent Gov. Dan Walker in the March primary, but this fall Howlett faces a very tough race against the Republican candidate:  former U.S. Attorney James R. Thompson.  Thompson is the reformer who has sent dozens of Daley's closest friends and associates to jail in recent years and the mere mention of his name is enough to make the Mayor and his henchmen apoplectic.</span></p> <p><span>Daley is a very personal Godfather-like politician and when something touches him closely he does not easily forget.  County office-holders, police captains, aldermen, the Mayor's own press secretary and even a former Illinois governor, are among Thompson's victims.  Daley's floor leader in the city council just went behind federal bars last month.  All of this combined with the fact that he wants a friendly face in the statehouse after battling Walker every inch of the way for four years, could make the Mayor go to any lengths to destroy Thompson in November.  Howlett defeated Walker by crushing him in Chicago, but downstate Walker carried almost every county.  Howlett will need help down there if he is to triumph over Thompson.  Stevenson is very popular in southern Illinois.  If Daley honestly thinks his name on the ballot will give Howlett a boost, he might do just about anything in his power to get Carter to choose Stevenson.</span></p> <p><span>Adlai himself would have some input, of course; even now he is no Daley puppet.  Stevenson is known to lean toward the Humphrey-Muskie wing of the party (Daley, on the other hand, dislikes Humphrey).  Additionally, there is some reason to believe Stevenson might not yearn to be vice-president.  But providing he would accept, it is conceivable Daley might try to pull the whole thing off.</span></p> <p><span>Then again, no can ever tell what's going through the mind of that little rotund man on the fifth floor of Chicago's city hall.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Facing Up To Real Issues | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>HE SUMMER OF 1976 brings with it the Democratic and Republican national conventions, and the subsequent choice between three moderate-to-extreme conservative candidates:  Carter, Ford or Reagan.  Along with stupid bicentennial hijinks a sinister amnesia seems to dominate American's thoughts about politics.  None of our prospective presidents opposed the war against Viet Nam, while two of them backed it enthusiastically from start to finish.  Political discussion this year is revolving mainly around fantasy issues:  can we hold the Panama Canal?  Who will do the most to trim bureaucratic fat?  And the raising of the \"personal honesty\" issue by candidates trying to avoid making substantive proposals.</span></p> <p><span>Of course, events of the last decade have shown what the issues facing this country really are:  Viet Nam, Chile and other deplorable emanations of American foreign policy should have taught that the U.S. government cannot attempt to enforce its international \"vision\" on other countries; Watergate and related crimes probably should have pointed up the dangers of the concentration of power in small corporate and political circles; the depression of 1973-75 crisis should have indicated the necessity of a national planning which is geared to full employment and an expansion of democratic decision-making in the economy; and the proliferation of violence in Boston during the past years over the issue of busing should have been sufficient proof of the fact that racism remains a toxic influence on American life.</span></p> <p><span><b>Foreign Policy in Crisis</b></span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>MERICAN FOREIGN policy is in a state of crisis.  Before Vietnam, American power reigned unchallenged in much of the world; American policy makers felt justified in and compelled to intervene in other countries wherever U.S. hegemony was threatened.  But the events of the last year--the victory of the PRG-DRV in Vietnam, the victory of the MPLA in Angola, the disclosure of CIA covert operations abroad, and the imminent rise to power of Communist governments in Western Europe--make this policy orientation increasingly untenable.</span></p> <p><span>The CIA has been one of the most important weapons of American intervention abroad.  The bulk of its covert operations and funds have been directed toward interfering with free elections all over the world and toward providing military and financial support for dissident groups favored by American policy makers, such as the neo-fascist Italian general Miceli.  The responsibility for these abuses--interfering with elections, directing coups and assassinations, training foreign secret police in torture techniques--lies with the administrations that have directed foreign policy, and particularly with Kissinger during his tenure as National Security Advisor.  Hence the CIA cannot be reformed merely by bringing it under firm executive control, as the half-hearted Congressional investigations have suggested.  To prevent the recurrence of covert actions, it is necessary to change the whole basis on which foreign policy has been conducted under Kissinger.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>MERICAN ATTITUDES toward the participation of Communist parties in Western European governments have been among the most conspicuous and counterproductive examples of the ideological rigidity of American policy.  Kissinger's intense opposition to governmental participation by Italy's Communist party--based on the increasingly anachronistic assumption that European Communist parties are part of a monolithic bloc under Soviet domination--is both shortsighted in terms of American interests and insensitive to the needs of the Italian people.  The PCI's rise is the product of long-term changes in Italian society, economy and politics--changes which are unlikely to be reversed.  American interference is unlikely to prevent an eventual PCI victory; it will only antagonize the electorate.  Furthermore, a compromise between the Christian Democratic and Communist parties is the development most likely to provide a broad popular base for a viable government; such a coalition is the only force capable of regenerating Italy's stagnant economy.  Americans cannot continue to view such a development as dangerous:  it would legitimize diversity within European Communism, and so increase the ability of Eastern European countries to explore alternative socialist models to that of the Soviet Union.  America must resolutely refrain from interfering in Italy's government.</span></p> <p><span><b>S</b>IMILARLY, THE U.S. should grant aid without strings to the Portugese Socialist government, which should form a coalition with the Communists as a way out of its present impasse.  The economic crisis in Portugal can only be resolved through attracting foreign capital and through some measure of sacrifice--in terms of wage gains--by Portugese workers.  But most Western capital, particularly American loans and credit channelled through the World Bank and other agencies, has strings attached:  the 'stabilization' of the nation, meaning an end to strikes, enforced wage cuts, and higher prices making revenues for a revived private industrial sector.  Aid under such terms would destroy any hope for Portugese socialism, while workers would be recalcitrant and possibly violent if sacrifices were forced on them in the name of U.S. and other capitalist nations' investment policies.</span></p> <p><span>Nor can the U.S. continue to view the world as polarized between America and the Soviet Union as when it intervened in the Angolan civil war.  In the face of the defeat of Angolan factions supported by the U.S. and South Africa, and the collapsing position of Rhodesia's white minority government, Kissinger has issued policy statements renouncing intervention against national liberation movements in Southern Africa.  But if Third World nations--particularly the black African states--are to view the United States's support for rapid transition to majority rule in Rhodesia as more than a tactical maneuver in the face of a collapsing minority government, the U.S. must fully repudiate the apartheid regime of South Africa.  Unless the U.S. exerts pressure on its corporations to comply with international embargoes on trade with the two embattled minority regimes, and on the South African government to abandon its rule in the immediate future, black nations will know the U.S. retains its generally racist and opportunistic perspective toward Africa and toward the Third World as a whole.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE U.S. MUST ABANDON the cold war and imperial perspectives on international politics which have forced it to intervene all over the world in support of anti-democratic governments, in opposition to popularly-based movements.  Otherwise, America will continue to founder without a viable foreign policy, finding itself constantly on the verge of reactionary interventions abroad which the American people do not support--like that in Vietnam and Angola; and the rest of the world will continue to regard its policies with justifiable suspicion.</span></p> <p><span><b>The University vs. District 65...</b></span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE UNIVERSITY BEGINS THE SUMMER ridden with labor troubles.  The past academic year began with the University's successful countering of the most serious on-campus organizing drive in recent memory and ended with a deteriorating situation in the University kitchens.</span></p> <p><span>The University has proven itself a staunch opponent of its own workers and unions at virtually every turn this year.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard has, by and large, succeeded in blocking a drive by District 65 of the Distributive Workers of America to unionize clerical and technical workers both on the main campus and at the Medical Area.  The drive, which began in 1974 in the Med Area, has met with near-complete success there, but the failure of the University to recognize the area as an appropriate unit for collective bargaining has resulted in a fiasco whose end still seems more than a year off.</span></p> <p><span>The case was divided into two parts, juggled about in the hearing rooms of the regional National Labor Relations Board for nearly a year, and was finally decided--against the union.  The decision was especially difficult for the union organizers to stomach in light of a seemingly contradictory decision rendered by the Washington board on a similar case at Columbia University on the same day that regional director Robert Fuchs handed down his ruling against District 65 at Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>The union's case took one small turn for the better last month when the Washington board accepted it for review.  The University should by now realize that its continued opposition to a Med Area union is both futile and counterproductive; Harvard must abandon its position against the union and District 65.</span></p> <p><span><b>...Faulty Grievance Mechanisms...</b></span></p> <p><span><b>H</b>ARVARD AGAIN ACTED UNWISELY in the case of Sherman Holcombe, a kitchen worker and union shop steward who was suspended in February after an altercation with his supervisor.  Holcombe's treatment in the wake of his suspension was lamentable; the entire case pointed up glaring flaws--as yet not rectified--in the University's internal grievance mechanism.  Holcombe's case proved that a worker cannot receive a fair hearing if his immediate supervisor--who is often a party to the dispute--is also called upon to conduct the investigation into the case.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard has repeatedly offered to refer cases of this nature to binding external arbitration, knowing full well that by doing so it would place the cases even further away from final resolution.  The University prides itself on its internal grievance mechanism, but has repeatedly failed to clarify, or indeed, to rectify it.</span></p> <p><span>The University's anti-union attitude and the breakdown of the grievance process claimed another victim when Paul Trudel, a Central Copy Services worker, was fired in February, allegedly for unionizing activity.  The whitewash which followed the Trudel firing was near-complete, and totally successful--Trudel, unemployed for several months and awaiting a ruling on his case, decided to drop his charges against the University.  Still, many questions remain unanswered, and the University has, as usual not been forthcoming with the answers.</span></p> <p><span><b>...Problems in the Kitchens</b></span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE HOLCOMBE CASE was a harbinger of greater troubles in the Harvard kitchens.  Frustrated by the racist policies of dining hall manager Buford Simpson, a restrictive summer hiring policy and the intimidation of shop stewards by Simpson and others, nearly 100 workers walked off their jobs during a lunch hour several weeks ago.  The repercussions of the walkout were predictable--all the workers who participated were punished with warning slips on their records, and three shop stewards were suspended.  No effort was made to initiate a dialogue between the University and the workers to resolve the problems which led to the walkout.  Instead, with the union's contract negotiations set to begin on the same day on which the suspensions were announced, the University resorted to the very \"confrontation\" politics which it so often accuses the union of employing.</span></p> <p><span>The University should abandon its anti-union policies now.  The workers, for their part, must press unceasingly for a change in University labor policy and practice, and must continue their drive to revise the internal grievance and investigatory processes.  Student initiatives to support the workers should continue and intensify.  Anti-unionism and policies which are inherently opposed to the workers' best interests should be doggedly opposed by a student-worker coalition, and should ultimately be discontinued.</span></p> <p><span><b>Affirmative Action</b></span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE BEST NEWS about affirmative action this past year was not that Harvard has met or is close to meeting its far too modest hiring goals for minorities and women, but that a group of students decided to band together to show the uglier side of the University's program.  In forming the Task Force for Affirmative Action, twelve student groups took upon themselves a job they felt Harvard and the Boston Office of Civil Rights were performing inadequately--ending Harvard's discriminatory practices and setting the University on a path of better faith and more liberal hiring projections.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard has made far from impressive progress in increasing its representation of women and minorities.  The tenured faculty here is still 92 per cent white and male, and minorities and women are still represented in greatest proportion in the lowest paying jobs.</span></p> <p><span>So while the University is publicly patting itself on the back, issuing favorable statements, as the Faculty has recently, about the progress made, a tremendous amount remains to be done.  Beneath the University's liberal facade, administrators are doing the minimum rather than going out of their way--as affirmative action demands they do--to act in better faith.</span></p> <p><span>No student group, however, should take on this responsibility alone.  Lacking funds, student support and student interest, the task force has had to move slowly toward its goal.  And the real tragedy lies in the fact that this ought not to be the task of students at all.  The University must push itself toward more willing and fuller compliance by changing its attitude toward increasing minority and female representation.  And if Harvard continues to refuse to make this change, it is the responsibility of the Office of Civil Rights to force compliance with federal guidelines.</span></p> <p><span>The task force is to be applauded for its efforts, and the University and the government officers seriously criticized for forcing students to assume their mandated responsibilities.</span></p>"}

{"title": "UHall:  A certain amount of politics | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>What Dean Rosovsky calls them is \"career civil servants\"--perhaps an acknowledgement that so many University Hall administrators were here way before he started and will last far after their current chief returns to the faculty ranks.  When John T. Dunlop was dean of the Faculty from 1970 to 1973 he kept a tight watch on individual fiefdoms; one member of his staff recalls \"he knew where every box of paper clips was and who paid for it.\"  Under Rosovsky the number of deans and assistant deans has proliferated--and each one has a good deal more autonomy than in the past.</span></p> <p><span>For some of the young career men and women, Rosovsky's expanding bureaucracy has provided a battleground for a particular type of heroism.  The case of Robert E. Kaufmann '62, assistant dean of the Faculty for finance, is a good example.  A record-holding varsity swimmer in his College years, Kaufmann has worked only for Harvard since two years after leaving the Business School in 1964.  He has seen tours of duty as director of admissions and senior tutor of Leverett House--among other posts.  Since Rosovsky's appointment as dean in 1973, Kaufmann has been charged with whittling the Faculty's $2-million deficit down to nothing.  And, if preliminary projections for academic year 1976-77 hold up, Kaufmann, with the aid of Rosovsky and the heads of the 30-to-35 largest departments, will have accomplished his mission.</span></p> <p><span><i>That</i> feat may have been the most important of Rosovsky's term so far--by the spring of '73 the Faculty deficit had expanded so greatly that the terrifying (for University administrators) specter of paying off bills through liquidation of endowment was a real possibility.  Taken to an extreme conclusion, the situation meant the end of the Faculty in, say, 2075.</span></p> <p><span>Nonetheless, Rosovsky made erasure of the deficit one of his two prime goals in office early on--the other was the reform of undergraduate education--and for his role in persuading departments to cut administrative and fringe costs, stop adding to faculty and even abstain from filling positions, and cutting energy bills, Kaufmann has been well rewarded.  Some UHall sources say he is now Rosovsky's most trusted adviser.  Next year Kaufmann will move up in fact if not in title:  he may have a seat on the Committee on Houses and Undergraduate Life (CHUL) and will devote more time to long-range problems, such as how the Faculty can finance high-cost research projects in an age of dwindling government, corporate and foundation grants.  Melissa Gerrity, an assistant to Rosovsky who works with Kaufmann, has \"learned the ropes,\" he said recently in an interview, and move up to handle day-to-day budget matters.</span></p> <p><span>In microcosm, that's sort of the way things work in UHall.  The set-up contrasts greatly with the organization across the Yard.  President Bok's Massachusetts Hall administrators have made their mark somewhere else:  Stephen S.J. Hall, recently resigned as administrative vice president, in corporate business, Financial Vice President Hale Champion in public finance, General Counsel Daniel Steiner '54 in government, Charles U. Daly, vice president for government and community affairs, in politics.  With the possible exception of Steiner, these men are at Harvard for only a few years.  A UHall administrator says pointedly, \"Jobs as Faculty administrators are not a stepping stone to something else outside the University,\" and that too is a big difference from Mass Hall, where Champion and Daly could hold posts in a future Carter administration.  Such a move might seem a step <i>down</i> at UHall, Dunlop's example notwithstanding--not that a politician could find much use for a UHall administrator.</span></p> <p><span>All that loyalty to the institution seems admirable and can only be met with a complaint stemming from the same source:  commitment to mobility within the Faculty implies less commitment to external goals--even those that other administrators and occasionally the federal government consider overriding, such as affirmative action.  The Faculty's recent improvements in minority hiring are small--only 4 per cent of junior faculty appointments were of minority group members last year.  The matter of emphasis is different, and results in tension between Walter J. Leonard, the University's affirmative action coordinator, and Phyllis Keller, assistant dean of the Faculty for academic planning.</span></p> <p><span>Keller, another close member of Rosovsky's \"kitchen cabinet,\" seems to view what some call the \"scholarly integrity\" of the Faculty as <i>the</i> priority in hiring, while Leonard apparently views the recruitment of more women and minority faculty to meet hiring targets as the foremost goal of the program.  The differences have led to private--and occasionally public--charges by Leonard that the Faculty is backsliding in its affirmative action efforts, that it is not giving sufficient support to recruiting and publicizing job openings, and that the Faculty's usual hiring \"standards\" are only one more way to enforce academic orthodoxy and ignore the University's affirmative action commitment.</span></p> <p><span>Administrators in UHall have wondered why Bok does not stifle Leonard and support the dean of the Faculty.  This issue surfaced most recently with Leonard's charge that Rosovsky's failure to post publicly the job opening for associate dean of the Faculty--filled by Charles P. Whitlock, now dean of the College--violated federal law.  Some sources speculate that Bok supports Leonard as far as the latter's criticism goes in pushing the Faculty to a stepping up of its minority hiring pace.  According to this theory, Bok cannot formally intervene in the dispute between one of his administrators and the Faculty.  But the continued presence of Leonard, and the persistence of his attacks, lend support to this argument.</span></p> <p><span>A certain amount of \"politics\"--UHall administrators describe it as far less than \"tension\"--is built into the concept of career administration:  all members of the bureaucracy depend on Rosovsky's approval to advance in the ranks and to hold \"line responsibilities\" regardless of title in the hierarchy.  Rosovsky himself has done a good deal to encourage this tendency, either deliberately or unconsciously.  Rosovsky prefers to utilize his own staff in academic and budget matters--Kaufmann, Keller, and John B. Fox '59, assistant dean of the Faculty for academic administration--rather than use the College dean, Whitlock, and other deans.  Promotion of Fox to the dean of the College post over Archie C. Epps III, dean of Students, and Alberta Arthurs, dean of undergraduate affairs, is only the latest indication of Rosovsky's dissatisfaction with the performance of the personnel on UHall's first floor.</span></p> <p><span>A lot of Rosovsky's displeasure is rooted in problems of housing and the College dean's inability to solve questions of student gripes about overcrowding, transfers policy and the House selection process short of involving the dean of the Faculty himself.  What Rosovsky's ultimate solution is for undergraduate housing is not known.  But whatever it requires, sources say, the muscle for its enforcement can only come from a figure like Fox, whom House masters will know is speaking for Rosovsky.  Although suspected of conservatism in general, and special insensitivity towards Radcliffe problems, Fox was chosen specifically as a \"hard ass,\" one administrator says.</span></p> <p><span>Fox's appointment ran into various kinds of masters' opposition, some thinking him not distinguished enough to run the College office, others lobbying against him because they had conflicts with him in the past about undergraduate education.  But administrative sources say Rosovsky is making a short-term versus long-term trade-off.  He has bartered immediate controversy, never very strong concerning administrative appointments anyway, for the belief that Fox will ultimately make decisions and give hard answers to the housing mess.</span></p> <p><span>Some UHall sources criticize Rosovsky for blaming Whitlock, pointing out that the dean of the College's responsibility carried no budgetary power with it and thus, getting the group of House masters into line behind any proposal proved exceedingly difficult.  Those same sources wonder if Fox, support from above or not, can overcome the problem inherent in his new job:  a lack of discretionary power stemming from a position without curricular or budgetary responsibility--a position that most universities call \"dean of students.\"</span></p> <p><span>Fox, judging from private conversations with UHall administrators, was really the only choice.  L. Fred Jewett '57, dean of admissions and financial aid, had more seniority but from the time of Whitlock's reassignment in late April made it clear he wanted to remain in Byerly Hall to polish his policy of equal access admissions.  Edward T. Wilcox, director of General Education, also had served in Harvard administration far longer than Fox's ten years, but he too declined to be considered for the post.  That left Epps, and few took his candidacy seriously for a lot of reasons, not the least of which was his current distance from administrative decisions and his mishandling of the Administrative Board when he chaired that body in the late 1960s.  Then, too, there was Arthurs--and her short history at UHall opens up an entirely different problem.</span></p> <p><span>Even before Arthurs made her move from dean of Radcliffe admissions to UHall last year, there were a few snags.  Temporarily out of a job because of the Strauch Committee Report--which commanded a merged admissions office with one dean--Arthurs, in line with the report's recommendations, bargained for another job.  That was all right, but the upshot was that her original request was pared down through negotiation to about half what she wanted.  Even at that, she still had sizable formal responsibilities:  the Office of Career Services and Off-Campus Learning and the Bureau of Study Counsel were to report to her; pre-med and science advising as well as general monitoring of the House tutoring system were in her domain.  Since the conflicts over housing and the status of the freshman year remained unresolved, then as now, that too seemed a potential future field of interest for Arthurs.</span></p> <p><span>But something has occurred this year to sour that a bit.  Arthurs declines to comment, but apparently she has received much less responsibility than her job outlined.  The reasons for this are not clear:  the guess of sources range from \"UHall just did not need another dean,\" to more hostile speculation, such as \"Arthurs was forced on UHall by the Strauch Committee and Mass Hall.\"  At any rate, the first floor of UHall looks like a boondoggle right now--there are three deans when one or two could do the job.  It is ironic that if Arthurs did all that was assigned to her the dean of the College would not have enough to do.</span></p> <p><span>General Counsel Steiner has one assistant in an office that is now regarded as a major nerve center at Mass Hall, handling the growing volume of federal legislation like the recently passed Buckley Amendment, opening student files, and various titles, labor disputes and law suits.  The dean of the College has a mass of deans and assistant deans under him, often formally repeating functions that are limited to housing, counseling and disciplinary groups like the Administrative Board.  Budget cuts, which Faculty academic departments suffered through in the last few years, didn't fall heavily on the College dean's office.  It expanded numerically in the face of austerity for everyone else.</span></p> <p><span>Whatever else may be true about the <i>office</i> of the dean of the College, there is probably no more respected administrator to students and subordinates than the current dean, Whitlock.  Finally, his past conflict with Rosovsky may be based on a difference of emphasis:  trained as a clinical psychologist, and one of the first instructors in Harvard's \"encounter groups\" course, Social Relations 1200, in the late forties, Whitlock is a firm believer in the importance of tutoring and counseling systems to students.  Rosovsky attaches much more importance to faculty teaching; higher education in his view centers around the lecture hall.</span></p> <p><span>But rumors of Whitlock's hesitance in taking on his new assignment as associate dean of the Faculty, in charge of coordinating Rosovsky's task forces on undergraduate education, seem pretty unfounded.  Whitlock now says that if \"I had to deal with House transfer policy again, I'd end up at McLeans\"--and on the pending reform Whitlock and the dean of the Faculty see eye-to-eye, at least on the strategic level.  Both want to implement task force recommendations starting next year, after sifting through them, on a bit-by-bit basis.  They want to avoid presenting grand plans such as those that went down to defeat in past years at Yale and Princeton because of Faculty opposition to specific sections of each plans.  If this approach works, Whitlock may emerge as the man who aided most in what another administrator says is one of Rosovsky's fondest wishes:  to restore the importance of undergraduate teaching.</span></p> <p><span>The Faculty's <i>other</i> associate dean in academic matters, Francis M. Pipkin, although a friend of Rosovsky's, is clearly not a member of his innermost administrative circles.  As head of the CHUL, Pipkin presided over that body's waffling and disagreement, never giving much leadership.  He concluded his tenure by giving the unwanted chairmanship back to Rosovsky.  On other matters, his record is similarly ambiguous--his work in the tightening of honors standards was foremost, but every amendment he produced to plug the original legislative holes seemed to open several new ones.</span></p> <p><span>Pipkin says attempting to get faculty approval for curriculum reform is \"like herding a flock of cattle.\"  He and other administrators characterize faculty conservatism as \"negative recalcitrance\"--a minority opposition to reorienting toward more undergraduate teaching admixed with plenty of apathy.  Many UHall administrators seem to agree that limited reform is in the air, but at best it is a type of reform that is unthreatening to traditional senior faculty prerogatives.  An administrator notes that legislation allowing students credit for summer courses taken elsewhere under certain conditions--passed last year in the Faculty Council--might never have succeeded if brought before a full Faculty meeting, where the move could have been thwarted, as some conservative faculty members may have viewed it as a threat to Harvard's sense of prestige vis-a-vis other universities.  Remembrance of the late sixties and the \"troubles,\" as one administrator calls it, prevent too much faculty enthusiasm for change.</span></p> <p><span>The changes that have come about or are now being planned by Rosovsky--like the budget cuts and a new emphasis on teaching--are the products of persuasion, not top-down commands.  Kaufmann says that \"a senior faculty can ruin a dean of the Faculty,\" and other administrators agree that their role is advice and service and possibly even leadership but certainly not conflict.  The faculty and its administrators seem to have an unspoken agreement which is, on the faculty's side:  \"Do what is necessary to change us in accord with external imperatives, but keep our basic power and structure intact.\"</span></p> <p><span>Rosovsky says the UHall administration is a \"family\"--he does not add, because he does not need to, that the senior faculty is its first cousin.  Like every family, the faculty and Faculty administrators quarrel, as they may well do over reform of core curriculum and General Education next year.  But like many families, they can, for the moment, share basic assumptions about themselves and their relationship to the world outside.</span></p>"}

{"title": "D.C. vs. PCI:  Round 8 | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b>N THE DAY AFTER the Italian elections, the Roman newspaper of the right, II Popolo, came out with banner headlines:  \"Victory for the Christian Democrats.\"  The same edition of Paese Sera, a leftist paper, was headed:  \"Communists Advance.\"  Clearly, the \"Italian situation\" remains unresolved.</span></p> <p><span>The elections of June 20 and 21 left the Christian Democrats (DC) with about 39 per cent of the vote in both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies (an increase of some 3.5 per cent over their showing in the regional elections of 1975).  The Communists, on the other hand, registered a gain of about 2.5 per cent over their showing in the 1975 elections, thus obtaining roughly 34 per cent of the vote in both parts of Parliament.  The losers were the smaller parties of both right and center-left:  the Christian Democrats apparently gained at the expense of the neofascists (MSI) and of their allies in the \"center\" (the Republicans and Liberals), while the vote of the left seems to have shifted from the Socialists to the Communists.  The resultant bipolarization will hardly contribute to the stability or progress of Italy.  The new government will not have the confidence of the electorate--whether (after the political manuevering presently occurring) that government turns out to be one of the DC alone, another coalition of the \"center-left,\" or the \"Historic Compromise,\" a government of DC and the Communists (PCI).  A compromise would probably be the most representative of the mood of the country but, given the Byzantine mechanics of Italian politics, it is the least likely.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE ELECTIONS WERE undoubtedly, as most commentators have been saying, the most crucial to Italy's future since 1948.  It was in that year that the Christian Democrats, with a plurality of 48.5 per cent of the vote, established themselves as the party that would dominate the Italian political scene.  Since 1948 the DC's hegemony has been uninterruptedly self-perpetuated through a political mechanism that, even today, is the most static in Europe.</span></p> <p><span>But below the surface things have been changing with increasing rapidity, as the overall trend to the left and the growing rift between left and right in these elections demonstrates.  The DC-headed coalitions of the \"centro-sinistra\" (center-left)--including the Christian Democrats and one or more of the smaller parties (Socialist, Social Democratic, or Republican)--have shown themselves increasingly unable to cope with Italy's economic problems over the past few years.  The rapid post-war industrialization of the country and the accompanying rise in the standard of living seem, in retrospect, to have peaked in 1969.  Since then, the DC has been unwilling to advocate restriction and reform of government spending--a policy that would damage the interests of petty bureaucrats and multinational corporations.  Nor has the party developed a coherent policy of \"austerity,\" which might include, for example, taxes on luxury goods.  In short, the DC has been incapable of presenting a concrete and effective platform to re-establish economic stability and redistribute the benefits of Italy's \"economic miracle\" on a more equitable basis.</span></p> <p><span>In the prevailing situation of mismanagement and corruption, the Communist party (PCI), traditionally the extra-parliamentary opposition, presented itself as the party capable of formulating and putting into practice a program of economic austerity that is the only cure for Italy's unemployment and inflation (20 per cent, according to recent figures).  During the recent election campaigns, the PCI backed a program of much-needed social reforms:  new hospitals and schools, more housing, and a crackdown on the wealthy industrialists who habitually evade their income tax.  Perhaps most important, the PCI offered an effective alternative to the politics of corruption and scandal that have become the trademark of the DC.</span></p> <p><span>The Communists raised one important question during the campaign:  can Italy's economic and social crisis be resolved without the recognized participation and cooperation of the 34 per cent of the voting population that the Communists represent?  And in fact, the PCI is and has been for some time represented on every parliamentary committee, and has played a large part in drafting and passing progressive legislation, such as the divorce bill and the proposed democratization of the armed forces.  On the regional and municipal levels the PCI--who now govern all of the major cities of mainland Italy except Rome--have proved themselves to be comparatively honest and efficient administrators.  What was contested during these elections was, in one sense, merely a formality, an admission of a change in the balance of power which has in reality already occurred, a change that has been gradually evolving since the workers' strikes in the \"hot autumn\" of 1969.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS responded by polarizing the situation.  The DC, throughout the campaign, flatly rejected the possibility of any coalition which involved the PCI, and the party secretary, Zaccagnini, went so far as to state that \"not to confirm the DC as the indispensable governing party would severely compromise the future of democracy in Italy.\"  This line of attack was supported by the Vatican (over the protests of leftist Catholics, including many of the clergy) and favored by the Ford administration (though not by US Embassy Press Attache William Lenderking, transferred to Bangkok because he advocated a more flexible policy with regard to the Communists).</span></p> <p><span>Using a strategy all-too-familiar to post-Watergate America, the DC delayed investigation of the Lockheed scandal, in which several top Christian Democrats were implicated, until after the elections.  The case of neofascist parliamentarian Sandro Saccuccu, who is awaiting extradition in London on charges of shooting a Communist at a street rally, was also postponed until after the elections--but Saccucci, who was reelected to Parliament, may now be able to obtain immunity from prosecution.</span></p> <p><span>In their efforts to portray the Communists as red devils, the DC employed not only the politics of the coverup, but the politics of terror.  Recent investigations have indicated that the escalating series of unexplained bombings and attacks (beginning in late 1969--suspiciously soon after the strikes--with the explosion in Piazza Fontana in Milan, including bombings of trains in the summer of 1974, and most recently, the killing of a state prosecutor in Genoa) all of which the government attributed to extremist groups of the left, may actually have been planned by the Italian secret service.</span></p> <p><span>Trying to hold on to power at any price, the DC portrayed the left as a united and anti-democratic front, with whom there could be no \"historic compromise.\"  Ironically, the result of their attitude seems to have been a hitherto-unseen unity among the PCI and the smaller parties of the left, from the workers movement, Lotta Continua, to the intellectual leftists of the Partito Radicale, and even including the Socialists, the habitual enemies of the PCI.</span></p> <p><span>The reorientation of the power base, whereby the Socialists, once to the left, are now, though reduced in power, at the center of the Italian political balance, casts the PCI as the \"true heirs of Italian socialism,\" as Lelio Basso, one of the most respected Marxist senators in the country, sees them.  Judging by their continued efforts to separate themselves from the Soviet aegis, looking at their evolving ideology of Marxism-as-practicable-in-Italy, this is a role the Communists are glad to play, though they may never officially admit it.</span></p> <p><span>The visible result has been not only more collaboration between the PCI and other parties, but also less rhetoric and more realistic proposals from the Communists and a considered and carefully articulated platform.  As they acquired respectability in the eyes of the Italian electorate, the PCI seems to have acquired a sense of responsibility.  Should they prove unable to fulfill the promises that gained them support, they now have something to lose.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HAT SORT OF GOVERNMENT will now emerge, whether the Communists will be allowed to officially assume some of the responsibility of government, remains to be seen.  What is immediately apparent from the election results is that Italy is becoming increasingly split between those who, as \"haves,\" defend the status quo, and those who, as \"have-nots,\" want change.  Looking at the tactics of this election campaign, and at the views expressed in its course, this schism seems to have been desired and for the most part created by the party in power, the DC.  The question to be answered by both of the \"sides\" is:  can the splitbe overcome in practice, can representatives of all of Italian society work together to attempt to solve some of Italy's economic and social crises?  The alternatives in this country where weak and unjust government has historically been countered with alternative systems of \"justice\" such as the Mafia, or fascism, are frightening.</span></p>"}

She's not sure what role the middle-class merchants and peasants played but, unlike most historians of the period who concentrated on the elites, she believes they were in some ways significant.</span></p> <p><span>While my friend was in the archives she wrote me that she came across a bit of a problem with documents and the archivist:  \"Pretty soon the man comes tottering back wiping cobwebs off a sort of cardboard box with hinges.  Inside are piles of documents from the 1400s coated with dust and encased in rubber bands, bits of strings, etc.  As you look through them the edges fall off--the archivist says 'eh beh' (so?) and shrugs.  I couldn't get them all back in the cardboard box so he came and helped, that is, he jammed them all in and jammed the cover on, smashing several wax seals from say 1430 in the process.  E beh?  As the archivist said later--these things have lasted 500 years, how much longer do you want them to last?\"</span></p> <p><span>America's history is not like Italy's, nor does the U.S. have an urban history over 500 years old.  But the story does illustrate two broad points.  First, that historians trying to fashion a \"history from the bottom up\" encounter problems elitist historians rarely encounter:  the elites of the past could afford the time, money and energy to carefully preserve their lives and times <i>from their perspective;</i> the members of the lower classes had none of these advantages and historians concerned about them are waging a long and difficult struggle to set the facts of history aright.  Moreover, as the attitude of the archivist points out, most members of the working class have seen no reason for saving useless documents or even, for that matter, translating their experiences into words.  Their concerns have always been more immediate as, I suppose, the archivist's were when he destroyed valuable documents in an effort to get on more quickly with whatever it is he was doing.</span></p> <p><span><b>H</b>ERBERT GUTMAN IS a social historian, who for the last 15 years has been waging the seemingly losing battle of writing American history 'from the bottom up.  And his new book, <i>Work, Culture and Society in Industrializing America,</i> affirms more strongly the need to preserve and reexamine primary sources in American labor history from its very beginning.  For Gutman has begun the difficult and long-awaited task of constructing a sound, workable historical analysis of American labor.</span></p> <p><span>In that task, Gutman does not tread new ground.  At least two schools of thought have developed theories of the origins of the American labor movement.  At the beginning of this century John R. Commons led the Wisconsin school of labor history in creating a standard interpretational framework that, as Gutman says, even later-generation Marxists and New Left historians rarely questioned.  To summarize and hopelessly simplify, Commons theorized that unions were economic institutions founded by workers in response to their loss of control over local markets due to rapid industrialization and specialization.  Craftsmen's local markets and skilled laborers were threatened by competition, wage cuts and exploitation.  Trade unions met these threats, according to this theory, through attempts to regain control over just the labor market.  Commons's theories have met with much criticism by historians, particularly for their failure to anticipate unionization outside craft and skilled labor industries, that is, in mass-production industries.</span></p> <p><span>More recently, Harvard's own John T. Dunlop along with others has proffered an elitist theory of labor organization development.  Again, briefly and simplistically, Dunlop in <i>Industrialism and Industrial Man</i> (1960) outlined a theory of industrialism controlled by management elites--labor movements were explained as conditioned responses to the nation's developing economy.  It seems obvious, in retrospect, that Dunlop, Ford's former labor secretary, would develop a theory useful to management and unacceptable to historians.</span></p> <p><span>But it is not simply the theories of men like Commons and Dunlop that Gutman questions.  He seriously disputes the very assumptions upon which their theories are based, assumptions built into terms such as \"labor movement.\"  For Gutman, no such term can be used meaningfully to encompass all of the American working population.  Indeed, Gutman says of the Wisconsin school that because prior to 1940, few workers belonged to permanent trade unions, \"its overall conceptualization excluded <i>most</i> working people from detailed and serious study.\"  (italics mine).  \"More than this,\" Gutman writes:</span></p> <p><span>its methods encouraged labor historians to spin a cocoon around American workers, isolating them from their own particular subcultures and from the larger national culture.  An increasingly narrow \"economic\" analysis caused the study of American working-class history to grow more constricted and become more detached from larger developments in American social and cultural history...</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>T IS THE LARGER developments that Gutman describes and documents in his title essay, the most theoretically ambitious in the collection of reprinted articles.  In \"Work, Culture and Society,\" Gutman presents his most striking case for the reexamination of labor history, at least during the industrializing process in America in the 19th century.  He concentrates on three important phenomena among the working class populations:  the different work habits and expectations workers brought to new factories from their diverse backgrounds; the social and cultural continuities in the lives of craftsmen and artisans during America's industrializing period; and similarities between forms of American working-class collective protest and those of their \"premodern\" European counterparts.</span></p> <p><span>What Gutman sees in each of these separate phenomena is the powerful way in which older cultural and societal norms continued, even in the midst of vast economic growth that, from the time Lincoln was elected to 1894, saw the U.S. move from fourth place in terms of the value of its manufactured product, to first and a net total worth almost exceeding that of the sum-total of the three previous leaders, France, Britain and Germany.  Sex, religion, nativity and prior rural and village cultures still meant something to workers caught up in an all-encompassing industrialization and its pressures to conform to management's demands for \"normal\" work habits, to break up the nuclear family in the face of unemployment and sometimes even to give up benefits ceded to one's own ethnic group (at the expense of others) and unionize.</span></p> <p><span>Gutman describes how New York cabinet-makers, ship-builders and other self-employed artisans followed a pattern of \"alternate bouts of intense labor and idleness,\" as they had in their respective old crafts and, as E.P. Thompson has pointed out, wherever men were self-employed.  But these older traditions associated with work were replaced by machines and met by management demands for regularity in work habits.  Occasionally men would continue with their older work-habits knowing it led to their impoverishment.  But Gutman is interested in the tensions industrialization created for these older lifestyles when they were faced with inevitable change.  An one of his tentative conclusions is that while \"suffering and plain poverty cut deeply into these ethnic working class worlds...Family, class and ethnic ties did not dissolve easily.\"</span></p> <p><span>Economic imperatives, Gutman thus concludes, were not the sole determinants of 19th century workers' way of life or even of their collective actions as a movement.  But he also emphasizes how much more research has to be done.  In an essay on Protestantism and the American labor movement, he only outlines the \"relationship between religious sentiment and rhetoric and everyday behavior.\"  He calls the relationship a \"risky\" theoretical construct, and asks for more study.  In another essay on black mineworkers and the miners' union he traces; the still sketchy life of one of the first black union organizers, Richard Davis, to demonstrate how later middle-class blacks such as Booker T. Washington--who once said that trade unionism was \"that form of slavery which prevents a man from selling his labor to whom he pleases on account of his color\"--were not the sole representatives of blacks.  Again, he says that while Washington has had his biographers and critics, \"the world of men like Richard Davis awaits its historian.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>G</b>UTMAN ACKNOWLEDGES his indebtedness to historians like Thompson, who have forged ahead with much the same task across the Atlantic in Britain, and Thompson's mark is everywhere present in Gutman's book.  But even in Britain, where Thompson's work has begun to create a great deal of new historical investigation, the forces of established history still exist.  One of the so-called classic reference textbooks in modern English history, R.K. Webb's <i>Modern England,</i> written five years after Thompson, is quite openly \"based on an old-fashioned but still lively assumption--that the people in power are and will remain the principal stuff of history.\"</span></p> <p><span>It is from Fernand Braudel, the French historian, that Gutman may get his greatest inspiration.  He quotes Braudel, who once wrote that \"victorious events come about as the result of many possibilities,\" that \"for one possibility which actually is realized innumerable others have drowned.\"  These others, according to Braudel, usually \"leave little trace for the historian.  And yet, it is necessary to give them their place because the losing movements are forces which have at every moment affected the final outcome.\"  American history still awaits such a perspective, but Gutman renews the hope that historians can study all people, in or out of power, who are and will forever remain the principal stuff of history.</span></p>"}

{"title": "RE-EVALUATION | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>To the Editors of the Crimson:</span></p> <p><span>This letter addresses itself to two complaints.  The first concerns the lead story by Julie Wilson on Representative Morris Udall on Friday, April 9.  I have two questions concerning that report.</span></p> <p><span>* What was the purpose of the article?  It is obvious that the story was an attempt to smear the representative.  The headline (\"Udall Wrote Letter to IRS on Sierra Club's Tax Status\") and the first paragraph (Udall asking for the abolition of the Club's tax-free status because it opposed him politically) of the story insinuates that Udall is prone to misusing his political powers for his own personal benefit and that he is anti-environmental (despite his rhetoric to the contrary).  The rest of the story, however, does not substantiate this appraisal of Udall.  Not only was Udall's action \"perfectly normal,\" but it was correct.  According to the League of Conservation Voters (LCV), the Sierra Club was, in fact, violating the law.  In addition, as Wilson notes later on, the LCV has ranked Udall highest among all of the candidates as an \"outstanding environmentalist.  Thus, instead of criticizing Udall, as Wilson obviously hoped, her article is, at best, ambivalent in its description of the representative's actions.  The article seems to prove nothing at all.</span></p> <p><span>* How is this article supposed to relate to Udall's current campaign?  The incident described occurred ten years ago, and, as is pointed out in the story, over the years Udall has gradually become more convinced of the necessity of conservation.  Today he is actually co-sponsor of a bill prohibiting any dams in the Grand Canyon region.  Is the story attempting to claim that Udall is inconsistent?  Far from it.  It simply outlines a change in philosophy.  I would dare say that a harsher criticism could be leveled at a man who was unchanging, and blindly sticking to one position.</span></p> <p><span>In short, the article seems too unwarranted and unsubstantiated.  I believe you owe an explanation of your motives.</span></p> <p><span>My second complaint centers around your \"Notice Columns.\"  Recently, in what appears to be a change of policy, the Crimson has begun to write its own headiings on the notices, rather than the ones originally requested by the person placing the notice.  Some of the headlines are attempts to be amusing (for example, the Hillel announcements).  The justifiability of this approach is questionable--I wasn't aware that you had also assumed the function of college humorist.  However, my particular complaint is about a notice that was definitely not funny.  This item appeared on Saturday, April 10, under the heading of \"Ethnic Purity.\"  The notice announced that the Institute of Politics fellow Gilbert Carmichael and his former campaign manager were to speak about the \"New South.\"  The implication of the title, especially after the controversy over Jimmy Carter's use of that phrase, is that Carmichael and the rest of the \"New South\" are racist and/or are in reality supporters of racist policies.  I would suggest that an apology is in order.</span></p> <p><span>These two complaints underlie a serious problem that pervades the pages of The Crimson.  This is the apparent inability of The Crimson to confine its editorial views to the editorial pages.  Consistently, articles seem slanted in both style and content.  Rather than responsibly presenting the news as disinterestedly as possible, stories seem to be selected for editorial impact, and then written in a manner that is decidedly biased.</span></p> <p><span>I do not make this criticism lightly.  I recognize that running a paper in addition to attending classes is a difficult, perhaps near-impossible task.  Yet you clearly do have the talent, facilities and dedication to make it work.  That is why it is so discouraging and annoying to see what could be a great paper become just another, irresponsible, student rag.  I would hope that you give serious consideration to this problem.  I believe many others would join me in suggesting that a re-evaluation is in order. <b>Tom Keane '78</b></span></p>"}
{"title": "Rock | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The sixties were a turbulent decade, and their turbulence was reflected, if nowhere else, in their music.  It was like you just couldn't walk into a coffee house in the Village or even Roseland Dance City any more, listen to Sly (Dance to the Music) or like the Byrds (Hey Mr. Tangerine Man) and not walk out without some sort of ideology or a big fat lump in your throat.  Bo Diddley was passe; Buddy Holly and the Big Bopper were, respectively, dead; Cream was strictly for Anglophiles; you were growing up--bye, bye Ms. American pie--you needed consciousness, man, Albert Shanker had taken over the nation's schools; now his half-brother Ravi was sitaring his way up the music charts.  So when they dispatched 400,000 of us up to Yasgur's farm, we <i>went.</i>  So what if we were only 12?  <i>Sly</i> was going to be there, man.  Hendrix (RIP).  And Country Joe and the Fish, man.  The Fish, did you hear me?  Dylan couldn't come only because he was recuperating from his (and the world's) accident, so he sent Baez!  The next best thing!!  So in that crazy, turbulent sea of mud and peace and love, all the goals of the French Revolution were finally realized, and the sixties could then die in peace (and love).  Or so everybody thought...Because--you guessed it again!!--ha, ha, the sixties are back!  And I'm not just talking about some vain attempt to stage just another Wood-stock; no, such efforts have been doomed to failure from the outset--look what happened in the early '70s, for instance.  You just couldn't get the groups, so you had to settle for poor tonality and a lot of onstage internecine politicking and back-stabbing.  (See photo) Warren and the Burgers, and all that.  But this weekend, my friend, you need only hop into your car (and I hope it's a microbus with drapes and carpeting in the back) and head on out to the 2001 Center in Gill, Mass.  (\"2001,\" we may suppose, is as good a reminder as any that the next century will have <i>its</i> sixties, too--only 94 more years!!)  I don't even have to tell you who's going to be holding forth at this Saturday's \"Rock Festival.\"  You know.  Country Joe is going to be there.  All right, so there aren't any fish any more, and Country Joe doesn't have any hair any more, and maybe no teeth either, but so what?  <i>Plus ca change</i> and all that.  Country Joe will be joined on the big stage by a whole bunch of people who would have been at Woodstock probably if they had made the right plane connections or something.  You know who I'm talking about--<i>Jonathan Edwards, Papa Johno Creach, Les Dudek,</i> and <i>Harry Chapin</i> (oh, I forgot, he was driving a cab in '69).  Anyway, Rubin Carter was granted a retrial (no thanks to you, I might add), so why don't the people go out to this May Day resurgence of peace and love and all that muddy stuff and celebrate?  Who knows?  Maybe it'll rain, or a baby will be born or something....</span></p>"}
{"title": "Horizontal Pinstripes | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>WO DOTTY OLD women shuffled along, their heads bobbing slightly, their eyes a little glazed.  One wore a plain black shift, the other a camel suit and wool hat.  No one recognized them, but they were led to a dugout box.  The two never exchanged a word, never even a glance, and that fit neatly into the legend:  everyone knew that years ago Mrs. Babe Ruth and Mrs. Lou Gehrig had had a feud which split their husbands' friendship.  And, the old story continued, it wasn't healed until 1939 when Ruth, in an open-necked shirt and blindingly white double breasted suit, threw his arms around the dimpled, still-uniformed, dying Gehrig before a packed Yankee Stadium.</span></p> <p><span>Regularly clicking open her compact, rolling more lipstick onto each sufficient coat of it, clicking it closed, Mrs. Ruth gazed around the park.  Out on the field, not far from her stood Joe DiMaggio, walled in by adoring reporters.  Joe Louis stood close.  Strolling around the new grass, having a swell time like college kids in Fort Lauderdale, were Mickey Mantle and Whitey Ford.  Clutching a black cane Toots Shor watched the men on the field.  It must have seemed impossible to Toots that DiMaggio was 61, or that Mantle and Ford were entering middle age:  they were kids when Shor was a legend.  Now that they were legends, and Dan Topping wasn't even remotely related to the Yankees, what was Toots?  An old man.</span></p> <p><span>In the upper decks, dozens of old men claimed that they had been in the park the day the Babe housebroke it with a home run, April 18, 1923.  Younger men claimed that they watched the day Mantle hit the ball that almost was the only one to clear the stadium, still rising when it smashed against the third deck tier, 565 feet from home plate.</span></p> <p><span>Shuttling into the ballpark, New York Democratic State Chairman Patrick J. Cunningham strode quickly, hoping after weeks of indictments and political tightrope-walking, to be lost in the crowd.  He had built the new stadium as much as anyone, profited more than most.  Cunningham was general counsel to the Yankees as well as party chairman, and there were those (most cogently, Jack Newfield of the Village Voice) who said maybe he had mixed his functions, more than a little.  \"The stadium is going to cost the city $24 million and six judgeships,\" New York's city council president had said in 1971.  On opening day, 1976, Cunningham had been indicted by the New York Special Prosecutor for involvement in the sale of judgeships, but the $24 million figure had been shortsighted.  The estimated cost for the renovation of the stadium was now $101 million.</span></p> <p><span><b>C</b>UNNINGHAM SKIMMED BY a mob which had collected in the freakish April heat and packed itself against the gates of the ballpark, pounding on the walls and demanding to be let in.  The ticket-takers had not negotiated their contract in time for the scheduled opening and when the management begged them, they said nothing doing.  No one was moving and the thousands of privileged fans who had waited two years to see the redecorated ballpark weren't getting to their seats.  From high above, a thirteen year old boy looked down from a ramp.  Obviously he had connections, for he had gotten in early, and was waving his arms at the crowd like a dauphin who thought that the storming of the Bastille was a celebration of his coming coronation.  He yelled and took snapshots.</span></p> <p><span>The crowd was not happy with the situation.  They began to shout and ram the gates, demanding entrance.  Teenaged boys scratched their initials and some dirty words into the new paint on the closed gates.  This upset a woman in a powder blue pantsuit so that she began to yell, \"Stop defacing the beautiful new stadium!  Stop it; do you hear!\"  Pat Cunningham scurried into the V.I.P. entrance to the ballpark.  The woman in the pantsuit began to demand that her husband do something about the vandals, whose activity grew more impassioned.  Her husband shrugged his shoulders, and as his jacket lifted with his body a revolver showed itself on his hip.  \"What could I do?\"  he asked.</span></p> <p><span>The short, charismatic television newsman Gabe Pressman moved in to interview fans.  Soon after, the gates opened and the crowd began to seep in.  The ticket-takers had agreed to work but clearly had conspired a slowdown--they were reading the small print on each ticket before tearing the stub.  Some waiting ticketholders tried to appeal to Pressman but he had gone around to interview the short, charismatic city councilman, Father Louis Gigante.  Father Gigante contended that if the city had not wasted so much money rebuilding the stadium, it might have stopped several schools and hospitals from closing down.</span></p> <p><span><b>F</b>ROM AN EXECUTIVE box in the stadium, George Steinbrenner's despotic eyes roamed his realm as the president of the Yankees watched the heroes on the field.  Steinbrenner had been for-bidden by Commissioner Bowie Kuhn to run his own club for two years after a conviction for giving illegal campaign contributions to Richard Nixon.  During spring training, Steinbrenner had for-bidden his players to grow their hair too long or bushy so that they could learn to appreciate the tradition of playing in pinstripes--some wise guy commented that he'd like to see Steinbrenner in horizontal pinstripes.  Steinbrenner's most recent indiscretion was in trying to foist an illegal contract on a pitcher he wanted named Andy Messersmith.  Messersmith caught on and signed with the Atlanta Braves.</span></p> <p><span>Down below, in the open-air boxes, the governor of New York, sat with ten of his twelve children.  Within a week he would allow Patrick Cunningham to proceed with his quest to get himself re-elected state Democratic chairman, legal problems aside.  There were those who implied that Governor Carey's decision was affected by the fact that Cunningham's counsel in a key legal fight was Edward Bennett Williams, treasurer of the Democratic National Committee and close friend of Democratic National Committee chairman Robert Strauss.</span></p> <p><span>Sitting alone with a single friend, a couple of dozen rows behind the governor was Congressman Mario Biaggi who ran unsuccessfully for mayor of New York City in 1973.  His raincoat was folded neatly over his knees.  \"So many happy days for me here,\" he said looking lonely.  \"So many great memories and smiles.  It's a wonderful park.\"</span></p> <p><span>Just then Whitey Ford was introduced.  Everybody cheered.  Then Yogi Berra and everybody laughed and yelled.  Then Mickey Mantle and the Stadium stood and made that noise thousands of people make when they greet a hero.  Finally, Joe DiMaggio's name came over the expensive new sound system, paid for by money that had gone through George Steinbrenner's fingers and Pat Cunningham's.  The small enclosed city stood as a unit for the great DiMaggio.  Governor Carey, Cunningham, all of them stood.</span></p> <p><span>Robert Merrill, the Metropolitan Opera singer did the national anthem, and Bobby Richardson, the nimble second baseman of the early sixties talked about Jesus Christ.  Next the new Yankees took the field against the Minnesota Twins.  They hit the ball all over the new park, beat back a 4-0 deficit and won the game 11-4.  George Steinbrenner told the newspapers that he wanted to see 100,000 people in his new park by the end of the three game series.  He got his wish.</span></p>"}

In the Great Crimson tradition of irresponsible and sloppy journalism, Mr. Kaplan did not bother to ask me or the Trilateral Commission office about the current status of this report.  Instead, he simply repeated the inaccuracies of an earlier Crimson account.  In fact, as Professor Bell points out, our report was debated and not rejected at the Commission's Kyoto meeting last June; and since then the Commission's has sponsored its publication in book form, with a foreward by the director of the Commission, and has devoted a great deal of money and energy to publicizing the report and disseminating it as widely as possible.

{"title": "Weekend Racer Aims for the Grand Prix Trail | Sports | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Gordon Medenica will never win the Indianapolis 500.  But the German-born Medenica doesn't let that bother him--he has his eyes fixed on a completely different star in the galaxy of motor racing.  Medenica may be willing to leavy Indy to the Unsers and the Foyts, but if he has his way he will become one of the few Harvard alumni to burn rubber in the rarefied atmosphere of the European Grand Prix circuit.</span></p> <p><span><b>What's Good for America</b></span></p> <p><span>For now, though, Medenica is slogging it out at the bottom of the road racing ladder, driving his Formula Ford in amateur races sponsored by the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA).  Up against dozens of other drivers who spend each weekend with visions of Watkins Glen and Monte Carlo dancing through their heads, he hopes to pick up enough racing savvy to make it worth the slow and expensive climb towards the road racer's ultimate dream--driving a Formula One in Grand Prix competition.</span></p> <p><span>The world of Grand Prix racing is not what most Americans, accustomed to the stock cars of Darlington and Daytona, might expect.  While Medenica's Lola T-340 will never turn world champion Niki Lauda green with envy, it is still a far cry from the souped-up stock cars made famous by the \"good ol' boys\" of the NASCAR speedway circuit.</span></p> <p><span><b>A Sleek Animal</b></span></p> <p><span>A Formula Ford is a streamlined fiberglass beast, housing a 100-horsepower Ford Cortina engine inside a 13-foot-long frame.  Capable of averaging speeds of over 90 mph, it is built to withstand the sharp turns and hills that distinguish the road racing course from the banked ovals of the stock-car loop.</span></p> <p><span>Medenica set out last weekend for Connecticut's Lime Rock Park, ready to tackle the SCCA's first regional race in the New England championship series.  Since he began his racing career in 1974, Medenica had never finished better than 12th in a regional, but this year he began harboring big ambitions.</span></p> <p><span>One reason for his confidence is the recently-purchased Lola, a vast improvement over his former car, which last year carried him into the pits for repairs more often than it brought him over the finish line.</span></p> <p><span>Another is the addition to his team of Dave Aronson, a freshman who spent last summer work with the late Formula One driver Mark Donohue.  Along with two of Medenica's classmates--Fred Boyd and Chris Yerkes--Aronson rounds out what is probably the only all-Harvard pit crew in the SCCA.</span></p> <p><span>Still, Medenica and his crew are not out of place at Lime Rock.  The track doesn't belong in the same universe with the half-mile ovals of the stock-car league; since much of the 1.5-mile racecourse winds through hilly countryside, it is hardly an ideal place for the beer-guzzling spectators who grace the speedways of the more popular circuit.</span></p> <p><span>Most of those in attendance come to participate in the race, and the overall atmosphere is one of nervous expectation and serious preparation.  It is, as Medenica notes, \"a youthful, affluent, basically hedonistic crowd,\" looking for more out of the day than a simple spin around a country road.</span></p> <p><span><b>A Costly Proposition</b></span></p> <p><span>This serious approach reflects the high cost of the sport.  \"The surest way to make a small fortune in road racing is to start out with a large one,\" Aronson maintains, and the figures bear him out.  A good Formula Ford will run about $8000, and a driver will have to spend at least that much during the seven-month season for maintenance, travel costs and entry fees.</span></p> <p><span>Medenica estimates that, without sponsorship from any outside organization, he will have to limit his activities sharply by the middle of the summer.  And since prospective sponsors are usually only interested in the big-name drivers of more advanced, higher formula cars, he is not alone.</span></p> <p><span>The road race crowd, then, is composed to a large extent of doctors, lawyers, engineers and other professionals better able to absorb the high costs involved.  \"It's a kind of Walter Mitty-type thing, but in a fairly affluent crowd,\" Yerkes explained before the race.</span></p> <p><span>Walter Mitty obviously never envisioned the whole picture, though.  If the race itself is an exhilarating experience, the long hours of preparation that precede it can be enough to try the patience of the most devout car-jockey.</span></p> <p><span>Medenica began the weekend early Friday afternoon, retrieving his racer from its garage in Concord and then towing it along on the four-hour trek to Lime Rock.  The next step was a few hours of sleep before rising at 6 a.m.  Saturday to beat the crowd to the registration line.</span></p> <p><span><b>Bad Karma</b></span></p> <p><span>Bad luck seemed to plague the effort, though.  After a series of official delays, the time for Medenica's first practice run came--and went--without Medenica.  A faulty battery kept the car out of the trial, preventing him from establishing a good practice time that might have put him near the top of the starting field.</span></p> <p><span>After a rain-soaked second practice, Medenica found himself placed 15th out of 18 starters.  A strong effort in the monsoon weather brought him in seventh after the rain-shortened ten-lap race, but he fell one position shy of garnering points towards the series championship.</span></p> <p><span>Still, Medenica was not dejected after the outing.  Racing, he explained, has an intrinsic appeal apart from the glory of finishing first or breaking a speed record.  \"It's like beating your head against a stone wall because it feels so good when you're finished,\" he said.  \"The whole process is a pain in the ass, but when it's over you still feel like you've accomplished something.\"</span></p>"}

{"title": "Knockout in Texas | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>M</b>ISERY LOVES company, and maybe that explains the kind words Muhammed Ali had for President Ford on \"Meet the Press\" last Sunday.  Ali said he like Ford a lot, though he didn't go so far as to endorse him, since he wasn't sure he was going to vote this year anyway.  Still smarting from being whupped by an upstart youngster named Jimmy Young on Friday night, Ali could take consolation in the fact that the judges, who apparently slept through the last five rounds, awarded him a narrow decision.  But he was embarrassed enough that he probably had an idea how Ford felt after the Texas primary.</span></p> <p><span>Ford found the voters of Texas more sympathetic to challengers than Ali's judges.  He had half-expected to lose in Texas, at least in the popular vote, but he was confident that he would win a sizable number of delegates, and even had outside hopes of matching his opponent's total.</span></p> <p><span>His challenger, a Great White Hope of sorts, was Ronald Reagan, and Reagan was the biggest winner in the Texas primary.  His landslide victory on Saturday was truly stunning:  he got 66 per cent of the total vote and captured all 96 delegates.  He carried every one of the state's 254 counties, losing to Ford in only two precincts.  Reagan beat Ford in the rural areas and the cities; he beat him in both Democratic and Republican districts, rich ones as well as poor ones; he beat him in every corner of a highly diverse state.  As they say down that way, he turned him every way but loose.</span></p> <p><span>An old Texas proverb says, \"God made some men big and some men small, but Sam Colt made all men equal.\"  Reagan may have looked small coming into the Texas primary, but he had the political equivalent of a six-shooter, only better.  He persistently won applause for his attacks on Ford's defense policies, especially on the issue of American control of the Panama Canal, which for some reason hit many Texans where they live.  It's hard to guess why, since most Texans have never been further south than Piedras Negras, or wanted to.</span></p> <p><span>Most likely, it springs from a deep-seated suspicion of Latin Americans, whose clever perfidy was proven for all time by General Santa Anna's massacre of 179 Texans at the Alamo, which, as you may recall, has not been forgotten.  Of course, more than historical antagonisms shape the views of Texans.  Many of them would probably identify with the response one cynic gave to President McKinley's professions of affection for \"our little brown-skinned brothers\" in the Phillipines:  \"They may be related to President McKinley, but they're not related to me.\"  Chicanos, who make up about a fifth of the population, probably look at it differently, but they don't vote in Republican primaries.</span></p> <p><span>Crucial to the emergence of the Canal issue was Reagan's tough-guy talk.  He warned that Ford and Kissinger were planning to turn the Canal over to the government of Panama, and summed up his own position bluntly:  \"We bought it, we paid for it, we built it, and we're going to keep it.\"  Though his analysis was weak, his rhetoric was strong, and an electorate only a couple of generations removed from the frontier and the justice of Judge Roy Bean responded instinctively.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE UNEQUIVOCAL defeat left Ford supporters like U.S. Senator John Tower sputtering in confusion.  He blamed it on the thousands of Democratic and independent voters who crossed over to vote in the Republican primary.  Texas voters do not register their party affiliation, and are free to vote in either primary when they arrive at the polls.  Tower's analysis was correct:  over 400,000 voters participated in the GOP primary, almost triple the highest turnout the party has ever had.  These were people who normally vote in the Democratic primary, but were disappointed with the pickings on the Democratic ballot and switched parties to vote for Reagan.  Not surprisingly, Senator Tower was miffed at his party's primary being decided by Democrats.</span></p> <p><span>Tower thinks that those votes discredit Reagan's victory, but Reagan is likely to make the issue cut the other way.  His supporters now claim, with good reason, that the primary proves Reagan's appeal to Democratic and independent voters, who would be essential to a Republican victory in November.  Reagan supporters can point to statements like that made by one Ford sympathizer who had forebodings of doom when it became clear that the GOP turnout was huge:  \"No Democrat would ever cross over to vote for Gerald Ford.\"</span></p> <p><span>The Reagan camp's interpretation of the results is largely accurate but somewhat exaggerated.  No doubt Reagan did attract many Democrats and independents, but a lot of them were voters who regard themselves as Republicans yet always vote in the Democratic primary because, in Texas, that's where 95 per cent of all elections are decided.  There are quite a few voters in Texas who have never pulled a Republican lever in a primary not a Democratic lever in a general election.  Seeing a bloody free-for-all on the GOP side, most of them probably decided to jump in and get in their licks.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>F REAGAN was the big winner on Saturday, the biggest loser was Senator Lloyd Bensten, who can thank Reagan that things didn't turn out worse.  Jimmy Carter soundly boxed his ears in the presidential primary, winning all but five delegates.  Carter got 49 per cent of the popular vote, leaving Bentsen with a thoroughly embarrassing 23 per cent, George Wallace receiving most of the rest.  The defeat was all the more humiliating because it was Bentsen who had set up the presidential primary--Texas's first--solely to advance his own presidential ambitions.</span></p> <p><span>The only bright spot for Bentsen was his easy victory over a vigorous challenger in the concurrent race for the Senate nomination, getting 63 per cent of the vote.  The challenge came from Phil Gramm, a conservative economics professor at Texas A&amp;M, whose attacks focused on Bentsen's supposed neglect of the Lone Star state in his presidential bid.  One TV ad featured two disembodied voices, one of which asked what Bentsen had to show for his six years in the Senate.  The other mentioned Bentsen's vote to expand the Voting Rights Act, his support for federal aid to New York City, and his vote to eliminate the oil depletion allowance.  The first voice replied pointedly, \"I know.  But what's he done for Texas?\"</span></p> <p><span>Those attacks hit Bentsen where he is most vulnerable, but Gramm did poorly, mainly because of all those people who crossed over.  If those 300,000 Texans had voted in the Democratic primary instead, most of them likely would have voted for Gramm.  That might have given him enough of the vote to embarass Bentsen.</span></p> <p><span>As it is, Gramm drew blood, no doubt helping Alan Steelman, the Republican Congressman from Dallas who will oppose Bentsen in November.  Many conservatives in the GOP are unhappy that Steelman was nominated, viewing him as a maverick with uncomfortably liberal tendencies.  One Texas Republican political consultant asked me not long ago, \"How the hell can Steelman come out for gay rights, the ERA, and legalized abortion, all in the same speech?\"  But Steelman is consistently on the Right in matters of government spending and management of the economy--he gets high marks from conservative groups who rate members of Congress--and Gramm's assault will help to solidify conservative opposition to Bentsen behind Steelman.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>NOTHER loser was John Connally, still the most popular politician in the state.  Connally has a reputation for political savvy, but lately he has done a lot to dispel that image, starting with joining the Republican Party in the depths of the Watergate scandal.  He refused to endorse either Ford or Reagan, probably hoping that the party might turn to him as a compromise.  That looks no more likely now than it did last week, and all Connally accomplished was to alienate both Ford, who might have been saved by a Connally endorsement, and Reagan, who owes him nothing.  Connally may have learned that nobody wins by refusing to play.</span></p> <p><span>Reagan's campaign has risen from the near-dead, and given his victories in Indiana, Georgia and Alabama, he will probably go the distance.  His showing in the upcoming Midwest primaries will determine whether his last campaign will be a victory parade or just a lonely walk through Death Valley.  As for Ford, he noted on Sunday that at least he learned to take the shucks of his tamales before eating them.  And, like Muhammed Ali, he learned never to underestimate an opponent.</span></p>"}

My mouth burned with the menthol taste of too many Salems, my head hung over with the after-effects of too much bourbon, and I had just about decided that I didn't love Jesus no more.  I lay in bed gingerly, not wanting to move.  Something might be broken.  It was 1:15, and I had 15 minutes to make lunch.</span></p> <p><span>I noticed I was fully dressed, including my shoes, and I also noticed those two letters on my chest.  My roommate is this solid Catholic kid from Walpole, always goes to breakfast, always goes to class, and--since the beginning of my degeneration in February--always brings in the mail.  He stands at my door, so as to avoid having to walk on my floor (which is always strewn with orange peels and broken glass and old vanilla wafer boxes) and throws my mail at my chest.  He's not always good at it, either, which is why we've lost two phone bills and they're going to cut off our service next week if we don't pay them $76.43 in the next two days.</span></p> <p><span>One of the letters was this big, bulky, official-looking thing, with a big seal on it, and 'Return within five days to PHYLLIS J. RUTLEDGE, CIRCUIT CLERK, Kanawha County Courthouse, Charleston, West Virginia.'  It was my absentee ballot, and, like any other first-time voter, I tore it open eagerly.</span></p> <p><span>There were all these envelopes and rules I had to follow which I momentarily discarded, and then I unfolded it--big and pink, just like a big red road map.  Just like a big pink road map for the soul.</span></p> <p><span>It was a Democratic presidential primary ballot.  It does no good to be a Republican in West Virginia, maybe because if you are a Democrat in West Virginia you are a right-center Democrat, and tantamount to being, say, a Republican in Massachusetts.  The only Republican West Virginians elect are governors, and they probably wouldn't have elected Republican Arch Moore governor except that his Democratic opponent was allegedly involved in shady land deals, and a former Democratic governor had just been sentenced to federal penitentiary for bribing a grand jury.  They thought he was honest.  Arch Moore beat a federal rap for extortion last week, so I guess the voters were vindicated.</span></p> <p><span>I lay there in my bed, and tried to find a cigarette, and looked at my ballot.  For president, I could vote for Senator Robert C. Byrd as a favorite son, or Governor George Wallace of Alabama.</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>ELL.  Byrd is a good ole boy, came up the hard way and all that.  The last time he ran for the Senate he got 90 per cent of all votes cast.  He's the Senate Democratic whip.  He's also a former member of the Ku Klux Klan, and he voted against every civil rights measure in the '60s, including the extension of the Voting Rights Act in 1970.  Senator Byrd is liberalizing himself lately, probably because he wants to be majority leader.</span></p> <p><span>George Wallace is George Wallace.  Selma, and school house doors, and 'Never' tie clips.  I looked down to the list of candidates for U.S. senator.</span></p> <p><span>Byrd again.  The only choice.  House of Representatives--a little more interesting.  John Slack, a ten-time incumbent, and Avis L. Hill.  Slack is this big, jowly guy I heard speak once.  Once he had the Protocols of Zion inserted into the Congressional Record.  The Protocols of Zion are something about a Jewish conspiracy to take over the world.  Like Dylan, I said, \"Well, I guess.\"</span></p> <p><span>Avis Hill is lots more interesting.  He's preacher, not a pastor or reverend, of some fundamentalist church up in Cabin Creek, and one of the leaders of a group that tried to remove English books from the Kanawha County schools a year ago.  The textbooks included short stories by James Baldwin, Allen Ginsberg, Gwendolyn Brooks, other radicals.  One of the formative experiences of my life was seeing Avis Hill lead a group of women down a street in Charleston to the building that houses the school board, where they built a pyre of the godless books.  They were singing \"We Shall Overcome.\"</span></p> <p><span>The governor's race is the big one, though.  Eight people are running, and they can be split into three categories.  The first is the Nobodies--including Ezra Graley, another itinerant preacher involved in the textbook hassles, and Powell Lane, and two other nobodies.  There there is the second group--the Semi-Candidates.  The Semi-Candidates include Charleston Mayor John Hutchinson and Rep. Ken Hechler.</span></p> <p><span>Hutchinson is a Jimmy Carter - type of politician, hard to pin down.  Some people say he's a Republican in disguise, but you could probably say that about all West Virginia Democrats.  Hechler is a lot more acceptable--his ADA rating is 94--but he really wants to be a U.S. senator before he dies, and he's 62.  And the word in Kanawha County Democratic circles is that he is running as a favor to Jay Rockefeller, who with James Sprouse is one of the major candidates.</span></p> <p><span>Jay Rockefeller is John D. Rockefeller IV '58, one of <i>those</i> Rockefellers.  Rockefeller ran in 1972, lost by 70,000 votes.  There are some who feel a Rockefeller just brings too much money and influence and power to political office.  I'm one.  Jim Sprouse, the other major candidate, lost in 1968.  The word is that Sprouse got Hutchinson to run because Hutchinson will eat into Rockefeller's Kanawha County power base.  So then Rockefeller got Hechler to run, holding out the promise of a Senate seat.  You see, the senior senator from West Virginia is Jennings Randolph, who is 77 years old.  In the event of his death or resignation, if Rockefeller was governor, Rockefeller would appoint Hechler to the open seat.  If Randolph did not choose to die or resign, well, there's lots of things Hechler could do.  Like become a director of the Rockefeller Foundation, for instance.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HIS WAS ALL very depressing, especially on this particular kind of morning.  But the final candidacy that ruined my morning was the election for the state senate in my district.  Opposing William Brotherton, incumbent and senate president, was Marvin Horan.  Marvin Horan is a truck driver-turned-preacher at the First Independent Calvary Baptist Chruch of Witcher's Creek, West Virginia.  He is presently appealing his three-year sentence for blowing up Midway Elementary School during the textbook issue.  I just didn't want to look at the big pink road map after that.</span></p> <p><span>The other letter was from a friend who plays basketball at a small Baptist college in West Virginia.  The writing was real hard to read; he was writing left-handed.  It seems they have parietal rules at this college, and he was in a woman's dorm around 2 in the morning.  This night watchman threw a light on him, but my friend easily outraced him to the door he'd come in through.  The only thing was, the night watchman had just locked it, and when my friend hit the door full-blast, he broke his wrist.</span></p> <p><span>It was now 1:35 and they had quit serving lunch at the Union.  It looked like it was going to rain, and the Sox would probably lose again.  I took my shoes off, loosened my belt, turned over in bed and set my alarm for 6.  Maybe I could make it to supper.</span></p>"}

His raft, the \"Detente,\" had sunk after 20 feet and he had spent the rest of the race consuming an entire bottle of Scotch.</span></p> <p><span>He had fulfilled the goal of the race, whose bicentennial theme was \"entropy\"--the tendency to disorder.  Yanofsky elaborated on this after the race, saying that \"there was absolutely no point to the race except to have a good time.\"</span></p>"}

{"title": "\"I Got Bit by a Seeing-eye Dog\" | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>ON FRIDAY SOME kid just wandered around testily, yelling \"Don't before me, my leg hurts.\"  He got bit, you see, on the subway, by a seeing-eye dog.  So Saturday night this Salem-smoking refugee from West Virginia comes in and says, \"That line's been rollin' and tumblin' around my head all day.  We gotta write a song about gittin' bit by a seeing-eye dog.\"  His almost-heaven West Virginia accent laid me in the aisles, where I rolled over Tim Carlson, self-described \"gangly, goofy, blushing, cowlicky, smartass, shynose, sloppy lunch eater\" who kneed me in the funny bone, and from then on it was bubbly giggles, side-eyed glances, uproar.</span></p> <p><span>Tim was inspired.  First, he wrote down all the letters of the alphabet so we could check rhymes:  aime, bime, cime, dime, eime, fime,... Then he wrote down all the names and things we could think of relating to blindness:  Moshe Dayan, Mo Udall, cornea-retina-pupil, eyeball-to-eyeball, I ball and you ball and you can't even see...</span></p> <p><span>Then pardon-me-whilst-Ah-whup-this-out Tim clickety-clacked the first two lines.  In the ol' kontry tradition.</span></p> <p><span>I wuz sitting in the corner of a sleazy cafe, Contemplating hari-kari and auto-da-fe.</span></p> <p><span>By the time our laughter turned to tears, we were committed.  It was 8:30 and there were gaggles of parties and we knew that this song, howsomever it turned out, would just have to be sung to the gathered rabble who would be the only ones to appreciate it (I mean, when you're sober and shaking from the vibes of that fifth-of-a-century mile-stone roaring up over the hill and down towards you in a Big Mack diesel dribbling lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise and ashes from a three-foot seegar all over the steaming tar pavement and dwarf pine trees, about to blow you off the road and ream out your Youthwagon--that's no time for a country song--that's the time for whipping a Ueey and glueing the gas pedal to the floor board and beating ol' Mack to 21 and beyond...) We had to get into the story, real quick-like.  So,</span></p> <p><span>Blinkin through a smoky haze and what did I see Dawg dragging a woman, all a comin at me!</span></p> <p><span>Right there on that last line we decided what the story line was going to be--love at first sight.  And it was time for the Bite.</span></p> <p><span>The Dawg was droolin I didn't catch his drift He chomped on my ass N gave me a lift.</span></p> <p><span>I sat on my fanny to stanch the flow Dog was snarlin' so I backed off slow Right into the arms of a slinky Arab-esque She planted a wet one on me you wouldn't see in burlesque.</span></p> <p><span>Then we read what we had, chucklin and chortlin, real self-satisfied.  But that last line had to be rushed through, rhythm avoided, kinkier overtones slithered by--just like Jimmy Carter whips through his \"Hi I'm the Nuclear Peanut!\" to avoid giving rise to the opaque amoebas crawling around in the basement of his soul.  In a sort of funeral home official's Gee-I'm-sorry-but-what-range-casket-do-y'all-want voice, Tim said, \"Just wait til we get some music--a little pedal steel is all that line needs.\"  I said, \"Music, Right.\"  The refugee said, \"Yeah.\"</span></p> <p><span>Well, the loving couple were together; we just had to get back into the story line and pound in the song's general lack of vision; and it was my turn to tinkle the keys.</span></p> <p><span>She was lassoed to the dawg by a seeing-eye harness</span></p> <p><span>And her love was a burnin like a Bessemer furnace.</span></p> <p><span>The dawg picked me cause she couldn't see.</span></p> <p><span>It was blind date, buddy, from A to Z.</span></p> <p><span>(See how the alphabet came in handy?) The refugee, Joe, \"a girl would giggle and I'd turn red, a boy would laugh and I'd bust his head; the worst-thing-my-daddy-ever-did-was-name-me-Joe\" Dalton piped up:</span></p> <p><span>Her name was Retina, and I knew when I seen her</span></p> <p><span>I wouldn't need much of a shove.</span></p> <p><span>I knew I was mad to, but my heart said I had to Become her <b>pupil</b> in love.</span></p> <p><span>Now that's country.</span></p> <p><span>We were stuck.  There was lots of Coke-buying, cigarett-bumming and flooding the bathroom in this interlude.  We weren't even drunk, and we had to explain howthehell Retina the Arab ever acquired her blind-faith blind-drunk opthomalogic condition anyway.  Tim came up with a suicide pact right out of the grand old Haemon/Electra Hamlet/Ophelia blues tradition and all we needed was an introduction.</span></p> <p><span>The dawg dragged us home, and she told me her story.</span></p> <p><span>I listened real eager, but it was too gory.</span></p> <p><span>A suicide pact with her loved she signed:</span></p> <p><span>She hit and he missed and she cried herself blind.</span></p> <p><span>It was 10:30 already and the parties were in second gear going into the first hairpin turn, yelping at the little mechanical rabbit and jostling for position.  It was time to move to a new location, close the shop out, hold a 50 per cent sale.  The only pun we could dredge up concerned the cataracts of the Nile, but all the Egyptian suntanned silt fucked up our upstairs wiring...rinse it out, waterfalls, going over the edge of the abyss...</span></p> <p><span>Last time I heard ol' Retina's call</span></p> <p><span>My love rushed out like a waterfall.</span></p> <p><span>She left a shroud on my soul, like a dirty cataract.</span></p> <p><span>Cause she walked out and she never looked back.</span></p> <p><span>It was time for the Jim McKay 11 o'clock roundup--corral the heifers, clam, the dogies, make one last summary plea'to the jury, drive our moral home so the Baptist preachers down in Dry Prong.  Louisiana don't immolate the album when we get it released.</span></p> <p><span>Beware of blind love--it's the very worst kind--It starts with a chomp on the ol' behind From the droolin and snarlin and nasty pink jaws Of an Arabian refugee's seeing-eye dawg.</span></p> <p><span>Aaah.  Finis.  Apres moi le deluge.  It was off to the Hong Kong.  \"Bourbon, please.  No water--never drink water, fish fuck in it.\"  Cozied up to the bar we started our recitation.  The guys with the mai tais over in the corner started throwing ice.  So it was out on the street again, and off to the parties, on our way to Nashville.  See you at the Coop, when we get to sign the album covers.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Notes from the Underground | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Spend Saturday night on the subway, they said.  Find out where people are going and why they're going there.  And make sure that something happens.  If you need to get mugged to get a story, get mugged.</span></p> <p><span>Those were, more or less, the instructions.  Here is what did <i>not</i> happen:</span></p> <p><span>\"It was late.  As the train pulled into Washington Street Station, the wino clutched the neck of his brown paper bag and lurched through the door.  I realized with a quick chill that I was alone, totally alone.  Suddenly, as the doors slid shut, a trio of leather-jacketed, acne-scarred youth darted onto the train.  The stench of beer and sweat and corruption filled my nostrils.  As one of the toughs sprawled insolently across a seat, another flicked his switchblade open and shut in dull, menacing repetition.</span></p> <p><span>\"Then he noticed me...\"</span></p> <p><span>No muggings, no hijacks, no escaped lunatics.  But the Boston subway as Saturday evening entertainment turned out to have its advantages:  cheaper than a drive-in, warmer than ice-skating, and more conducive to intimate discussion than a freshman mixer.</span></p> <p><span>At the Harvard Square station, David Hershey-Webb (\"pretentious name,\" he apologized) told me has cut short a planned evening of guitar-playing, singing and coin-collecting in front of the Coop to go to a party at the Commonwealth School, a progressive private school in a Back Bay townhouse.  \"I went to school there last year, and I'm going to go there again next year,\" Hershey-Webb said.  \"This year I'm taking a sabbatical at a Boston public high school so I won't be a private schoolie like her.\"  He pointed to the girl sitting next to him.  She did not smile or seem insulted, but acknowledged that she went to Commonwealth and said that her name was Deborah Alkema.  Like Hershey-Webb, she had long blond hair and wore jeans but unlike him she sported no Udall button.</span></p> <p><span>Hershey-Webb went on.  \"The school I'm at now is really terrible.  It blew my mind.  There are seniors who can't read.  If you can't read, you're nowhere.  What they do all day is beat people up.\"  Hershey-Webb said he was \"trying to reform the place in my own quiet way.\"  So far his campaign had involved writing a letter to the school paper, explaining why \"their methods of teaching are wrong, and their attitudes are wrong.\"  \"Anyway,\" he said, \"it's an experience, and that's what I wanted.\"  He and his friend got off on the right side of the train at Park Square, and I got off on the left.</span></p> <p><span>At Park Square, a woman was waiting for an Ashmont car with what looked like a stewardess outfit folded neatly over her arm.  She said her name was Pat and she was not a stewardess, but a guard for American Airlines.  The insignia on her uniform said SECURITY '76.</span></p> <p><span>For the last 16 months Pat had watched boarding passengers walk through the X-ray machines.  She liked the job, she said, because there was always something going on and interesting people to see through.  Just a few weeks ago, she said, Cliff Robertson had been at Logan.  When pressed for an evaluation of Robertson's sex appeal, Pat admitted that only her sister had seen him, and that she hadn't even known who Robertson was.  \"But a while before that, one of Ford's sons came by,\" Pat said.  \"He walked through the machine like everyone else, even though he didn't have to.\"</span></p> <p><span>Pat craned her neck as a train approached, but it was the wrong one.  \"Lord, I hate the subway,\" she said.</span></p> <p><span>Upstairs the platform was almost empty.  A uniformed T worker with a bullhorn had just announced to a small band, including a forlorn David Hershey-Webb, that a derailment at Copley Square had broken all Green Line service as far as Kenmore.  Above ground, a confused crowd waited for buses.  The overland route brought us to Kenmore Square, where another disgruntled crowd milled about.  Across Beacon Street, in the Relax-A-Bit coffee house, a streetcar driver sullenly sipped coffee.  He looked as gloomy as if he had driven the streetcar off its track himself; perhaps the derailment meant he would have to work late.</span></p> <p><span>I took the stool next to him at the counter and greeted him.</span></p> <p><span>\"How'd it happen?\"  I asked cheerfully.</span></p> <p><span>The man didn't look up from his coffee.  \"Don't know.  Just got on duty now.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Ahhh.  That's what he <i>says,\"</i> a strange voice said.</span></p> <p><span>I turned to my left and saw a young man with very long black hair and glazed, demonic eyes.  He was snickering into his coffee, drops of which dribbled down his straggling beard.  \"Don't know!  Don't know!\"  he mimicked nastily.  He sniggered some more.</span></p> <p><span>The T worker glared at him.  Behind the counter the waitress asked the driver how he wanted his steak.  \"Christ, any way,\" he said, and wheeled his stool to show his back to both of us.</span></p> <p><span>\"Cheer up,\" the bearded man said.  \"Everyone makes mistakes.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"I don't know how the fucker could have done that,\" the man said.  \"I've been working on this line for 28 years, and I don't see how it could have happened.\"  The old conductor's voice echoed in the tunnel between Copley and Auditorium.  In the dimness before us the streetcar splayed incongruously across the width of the tunnel.  Emergency workers hovered about it uncertainly, shook their heads, spat, conferred in short spurts of strategy.  Occasionally they would seek advice from the telephones that seemed to grow out of the cave walls.  In the dark unfamiliar tube the men spoke softly, as if not wanting to disturb an accident victim.</span></p> <p><span>A supervisor came and hustled me back to the station platform.  \"We won't know why it went off until we get it back on,\" he said absent-mindedly.  \"Just tell your readers that service will resume in half an hour or so.\"</span></p> <p><span>The orange line was quiet and people were glad to talk.  A young black man had just come from heavyweight wrestling at the Garden, where he had been impressed by the performance of Bugsy McGraw.  \"The whole thing is phony,\" he told me, \"But it's great entertainment.  I go once a month, and never miss it on Saturday morning T.V.\"</span></p> <p><span>Charlie, a stout, perspiring private cop who works at Logan, said that his job there was \"to guard the stewardesses,\" and he winked.  Then more soberly he said that most stewardesses are respectable married women and that \"only 25 per cent or so are quote unquote The Stewardesses.\"  Charlie would like to be a steward for Delta, but he said he is not sexy enough to get the job.</span></p> <p><span>A polite, middle-aged, slow-talking gentleman cornered me to discuss his model train collection.  I escaped off the train and down a long dark passageway which led to the red line and a Quincy train.</span></p> <p><span>I got off at Quincy Center, last red line stop.  Four or five blocks from the station I came to the Oyster House, fine food and drink.  In the dimly-lit bar a dozen customers were enjoying the fine drink.  No one ate oysters.</span></p> <p><span>A color movie flickered unwatched across a large screen on the right-hand side of the restaurant.  The drinkers sat with their backs to the film, while Al the bartender, a skinny man with tremendous ears, told stories and teased his regular customers.  I squeezed onto a barstool between a large Lite drinker and a large Schlitz drinker and asked the name of the movie.</span></p> <p><span>\"More of the hippie bullshit,\" the bartender grinned.  \"Strawberry Statement, something like that.  You ought to know all about it.\"  His ears wagged as he laughed, and the Lite drinker on my left smiled appreciatively.</span></p> <p><span>No offense intended, though.  As a peace gesture the bartender gave me a story along with my Bud.  \"Six or seven years ago it was,\" he said, \"I bet four bucks on the twin daily double at Rockingham.  It came through, only for eleven dollars.  Eleven goddam dollars!  I know a guy who won five grand on a four-horse birdcage.\"  Al said he was so disgusted he just tore the tickets up.</span></p> <p><span>On the screen some clean-cut radicals were holding their arms up against a wall waiting to be frisked.  Al and the Lite drinker on my right discussed Hank, an old jockey.</span></p> <p><span>\"Wasn't he in the hospital a while back?\"  Lite asked.</span></p> <p><span>\"Yeah, that's right,\" Al said.  \"Fell off his horse and got run over.\"</span></p> <p><span>Lite shook his head.  \"Where is he now?\"</span></p> <p><span>\"He isn't,\" Al chuckled.  \"He died a week later.\"  Someone called for another Miller and Al strolled down the bar.  Pasteurized rock music leaked from the screen.</span></p> <p><span>I left Oyster House in time for the last train to Harvard.  Between Wollaston and Park I had the train to myself.  Now was the time for the punks to appear, but the train rollicked on peacefully.  At Park Station the Cambridge couples began to fill the car, back from the movies, from dancing, from dining out.  By the time we reached Harvard Square the train was quite full.  The station's usual urine smell was mixed with marijuana and perfume, it being Saturday night.</span></p>"}
{"title": "The Half-hearted Hustle | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b><i>1. THE CLUB AT 15 LANSDOWNE STREET</i></b></span></p> <p><span><b>Listen.  The music here is louder than anything you will hear.  It is made by machines:  a clanging of metal on metal, the twanging of invisible red-hot wires, a shuffling of wood and sand, and maybe, just maybe, the sound of something human.  A woman coos in a muted voice, as if she were speaking through bed sheets.  A man wails deep; his anguish, supposedly lashed to a sexual moment, is only the synthetic spawn of the recording studio--artificial, abstract.  A chorus of women chant undecipherable orisons to some street-wise goddess</b> of love.  Their voices are synchronized to a single, thin line; you can't tell if there are three, ten, or thirty women singing.</span></p> <p><span>Look.  The guts have have been carved out of this huge, high-ceilinged warehouse and the walls have been painted bright blue.  A plush veneer--carpets, mirrors, glittered cushions--has been splashed over the walls and floors.  In the middle, in the big empty space, people are dancing.  From up above them seem one pulsating mass--a motley, throbbing protoplasm that expands and contracts in rhythm to the newest disco song.  As the music reaches fever pitch, it threatens to engulf the upper mezzanines, slide out to the hallway, push itself out the door and burst smokily all over Lansdowne Street.</span></p> <p><span>Look closer.  These people are bored.</span></p> <p><span><i>2.  The Man With the Orange Cape</i></span></p> <p><span>Turning around and around and around with only the slightest trace of ballet training, the boy refuses to sweat.  He whirls on a small round platform set eight feet above the crowd, nearly nude, brandishing a large glimmering orange cape.  A dark oval beauty-mark is stencilled on the front of his thigh.  He thinks about how hot it is under the lights.  Up here on the smooth plaster cylinder he is safe; it is his turf, aloof, contained.  Despite the energy of his grinding movements, no emotion glides over his soft face and glazed eyes.  Perhaps he imagines that there is a razor-tin glass wall around his little world that keeps out the fat curls of smoke and perfume and breath thickened with alcohol.  Here is no tall, thin, hipless model.  The boy is a bit short and very muscular--he resembles classical statues of Greek god.  Perhaps he pretends he is centuries away, dancing in some ancient mystic ritual.  The glass wall deflects all human contact:  he will twitch his butt at you but he will not meet your eye.</span></p> <p><span><i>3.  The Tourists</i></span></p> <p><span>She and her husband are the first couple on the dance floor.  The years between them add up to a tweedy century.  They swirl in a self conscious foxtrot, counting every two beats as one.  Their time is halved like this:  for a few minutes they will dance absent-mindedly, staring in wonder at the crowd; then they will close their eyes, hug closer, and do a fair imitation of themselves thirty years earlier.</span></p> <p><span>They are dancing at a wedding.  The man smiles indulgently and it becomes obvious that it was his wife's idea to come here tonight.  Occasionally his eyes turn smoky as a plunging neckline or tight pair of pants parade by.  His wife is less happy--there is a quality both frantic and clinical to the way she examines the couples of men who walk by hand in hand.  The woman frowns and squints, as though she were looking for something she had misplaced, like a handbag or a half-finished drink.  Perhaps she is looking for her son.</span></p> <p><span><i>4.  The Half-Hearted Hustle</i></span></p> <p><span>\"Saturday night brings out the amateurs,\" my friend Morgan explained.  I laugh, trying to envision Ted Mack among this sleek-satined, strobe-lighted decor.  \"Let's face it--disco clubs were a fad.  They peaked maybe ten months ago.  It was all over about three months ago.\"  We are sitting in a small anteroom towards the front of the club where they serve a limited menu of hot foot.  No one is here to eat and all the high-backed bamboo chairs are empty.  A young couple, the man in aqua double knits and the woman in a gay flowered dress, walk by, giggling.  Morgan rolls his eyes and turns to me, \"Let's face it, all the turkeys come to discos now.\"  The aqua man slides a nip at the flowered girl's ear and she shrieks, \"Jesus, Harry, not in public\" Ted Mack wouldn't feel so out of place after all.</span></p> <p><span>The changing surface of 15 Lansdowne Street reflects all this.  Expensive cover charges are dropped, then raised, then juggled desperately from night to night in an attempt to draw a larger crowd.  The management retrenches, closing the club at two now instead of four a.m.  The lavish vases of fresh-cut flowers--crisp white carnations and crowds of blue irises the color of twilight--are gone.  The bare walls have emerged from behind them, triumphant.  Heavy and silent, they tolerate the denim-bedecked transient dancers and ache from their loud stream of music.  The smaller inanimate objects--little glass tables, sculptured plastic chairs, ashtrays that bear no name--huddle in groups, almost afraid:  their conspiracy against the walls is over.  15 Lansdowne Street is waiting to become a warehouse again.</span></p> <p><span><i>5. Time Out</i></span></p> <p><span>In the cooler air of the bathroom women are divided into two camps:  those that look like Bette Midler and those that are thin.  The former sport needle-thin eyebrows, wavy permanents, and blood-dark lipstick that shines like grease within the neatly-pencilled borders of their mouths.  The latter droop against walls and sinks and toilet stall doors, saying nothing; they seem to think that being thin is enough.  They're embarassed to be here, as if admitting to human functions belies their lifeless mannequin status.</span></p> <p><span>A few of the women have come with other women, and a few have come with gay men, but most are here with straight dates.  In fact, almost half of the people here tonight are straight, which is bad news for a gay bar--when a bar turns increasingly straight, the gay clientel, whether out of resentment or discomfort, will move elsewhere.  15 Lansdowne has tried to limit the number of women (one way they do this is by demanding stricter picture identification from women at the door) but when finances get shaky, a customer is a customer.</span></p> <p><span>One or two men have joined the waiting line.  No one is really sure whey they're here--the men's room is a short five feet away--but no one pays any attention.  Music is piped in from the main room and some have started dancing to it, watching themselves in the wall mirror; pouting, panting, grinding, one woman stares in a hypnotized daze at the reflection of her own breasts.  People balk before turning on the water--the tilting phallic shaped faucets make washing one's hands a curiously obscene act</span></p> <p><span><i>6. Basketball Beefcake</i></span></p> <p><span>Wholesome as milk and doughnuts, the waiter scoots by, gathering used ashtrays and empty glasses on the way.  Like most people here, his clothes are what you see first, from the unmuddied sneakers and bleached athletic socks to the bright satin basketball uniform with the letters stitched on the back:  15 Lansdowne.  He is part of a team which is playing a game and the game is this:  look but don't touch.  Smooth-faced youth and athletic grace are the common denominators among the waiters here.  He weaves between tables and chairs like a pro headed for that tie-breaker basket.  Clean hair, clean suit, clear eyes, clean cut; we're convinced that when the bar closes at 2:00 a.m. he will head home in a blue Ford station wagon driven by a saddle-shoed, gum-chewing, pigtailed girl.</span></p> <p><span><i>7. Clearing Out</i></span></p> <p><span>Suddenly the music stops.  It is 2 a.m., and out of nowhere materialized uniformed policemen, plaid-jacketed plainclothesmen, and a searchlight the size of a cannon.  The disc-jockey abandons his notorious sound system to steer the bright beam over the crowd.  The silver-studded dancers break apart like mercury and slither sullenly towards the exit.  There is a twenty minute wait for coats;the boy with the orange cape has donned less auspicious clothing and bustles about the cloakroom, calling out numbers, grabbing tickets, rolling his eyes.</span></p> <p><span>This is taxicab territory; unlike other parts of Boston, there was no mass exit at 12:30.  The people here had enough money to pay a five dollar cover charge (two drinks included,) fifty cents for a mandatory coat check, $1.75 for additional drinks and eighty-five cents for a pack of cigarettes--cab fares are no problem.

{"title": "Let Bygones Be Bygones | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>If they ever write a book about us, you can be sure they will call it <i>The Unmaking of the President, 1976.</i>  Rarely, if ever, has such an outstanding political commodity been so quickly and utterly obliterated.  Muskie, after all, had less class than Bayh.  And even he lasted through Florida.</span></p> <p><span>Though it is not my purpose here to dwell upon them, there were, of course, mistakes.  I personally had a hand in two of the finest.  One, which turned into a minor scandal last October, involved the printing of membership applications for an organization whose caucus we planned to pack.  Not precisely illegal, but not the ethical pinnacle of my career either.  We got caught.</span></p> <p><span>The other mistake is still too sensitive to discuss in detail.  It happened much later, and sometimes I wonder if it cost my man the presidency.  It had to do with a lie that I neglected to tell the press at a time when not only John Marttilla's guerillas, who were masterminding Udall's campaign, but even Ellen McCormack had figured out how to play the media for all they were worth.  And that was a lot in 1976.  But more about Ellen McCormack later.</span></p> <p><span>The big mistakes--the really big ones involving basic strategic decisions--are a much more fuzzy matter.  Not that no one claims responsibility.  With a great deal of grace, our hurly-burly, unanimously beloved campaign manager Jack Walsh, has said repeatedly that it was he who made the bad moves.  On election night, Walsh even claimed to friends and staff that he and he alone was responsible, a noble but untrue argument.</span></p> <p><span>For it is obvious that in every campaign there are mistakes and that a major difference between the winners and the losers is that those campaigns which have the money or the time are able to recoup, regroup and alter strategy.  Yet almost every decision in the Bayh campaign was dictated by money constraints and made so late that they were binding for the duration.  There was no flexibility, and not even Boston's political Vince Lombardi, Mr. Walsh, can predict the future with perfection.  It was lack of time, not bad decisions, that did us in.</span></p> <p><span>Which, I suppose, leaves responsibility with the candidate, who entered the race only five months before he withdrew.  But that may not be fair either, because the top four finishers had been running for six years, two years, 12 years, and three years, respectively.  Who should have foreseen that our electoral process actually begins at some time before the <i>previous</i> election is held?  Certainly this is not what the founding fathers envisioned when they set out to create a fluid democracy, sensitive to an everchanging electorate.</span></p> <p><span>Whatever the case, the real mistake of 1976 was not made by Jack Walsh, Birch Bayh, or me.  It was made by the Democratic voters and non-voters in this allegedly progressive commonwealth.  That they did not vote for Birch Bayh is forgiveable; that the Democratic conservatives outpolled the liberals by close to a 60 to 40 per cent margin is not.  Between them, Bayh, Harris, Udall, Shriver and Shapp received 37.9 per cent of the vote in a state in which Democrats usually favor the liberals by 20 percentage points.  Fifty-eight per cent of the vote went to Messrs.  Jackson, Wallace, Carter and Ms. McCormack, a relative shift of 30 to 40 per cent to the right, depending upon how you interpret the center vote.  It is a figure which is frightening, unless perhaps you are Governor Dukakis.  In that case, it may be heartening to know that all who voted Republican and a healthy majority of your Democratic constituents have just endorsed your policy of doing less for poor people as a solution to national stagnation.</span></p> <p><span>The point was brought home forcefully to me one week and two days before the primary.  Already burnt out and functioning on the campaign adrenalin which had replaced sleep and exercise sometime in early November, I left work at 10:00 on a Saturday night and drifted over to a party for the Harvard squash team in one of the River Houses.  Once there, surrounded by non-politicos and unable to remember the last time I had set racquet to ball, I ran into that phenomenon so common to political people who wander outside of the fold; I had nothing to talk about.</span></p> <p><span>So I stood by a wall, sipped on some punch, and feeling very alien indeed, observed my contemporaries at play.  Eventually, thankfully, I was rescued by the arrival of JF, our eleventh congressional district coordinator.  We quickly retreated to an empty living room and hunkered down to basics, a discussion of how we were <i>really</i> doing (great) and about infighting taking place at the high command (Byzantine).</span></p> <p><span>After some time, three women from Wellesley College--strangers no less--crept into the room and sat on the floor listening.  Perhaps they were amused by the sight--two college boys spending their Saturday night next door to a party, discussing the nuts and bolts of pulling votes in downtown Quincy.</span></p> <p><span>At any rate, they were none too familiar with Birch Bayh, and one of them finally asked us why she should vote for him.  I was tired but JF was not, and for ten minutes one of the best organizers in the state lectured her on the merits of Birch Bayh; his jobs proposals, his leadership in the Senate, his unequalled record on women's rights, his great American coalition, his incomparable political assets.  They all listened carefully, but I could see that the one who asked the question wanted more.</span></p> <p><span>Again she spoke up.  \"Well, that's all well and good,\" she said, \"But what about the Brazilians?  Where does he stand on them?\"</span></p> <p><span>The question was not really a curve.  It turned out that the girl had spent a year down there, living under an oppressive American-supported dictatorship, living amidst a poverty whose lifeblood was an economic structure kept alive by the presence of powerful U.S. corporations.  And she wanted to know why none of the candidates ever talked about those people.</span></p> <p><span>\"After all,\" she pointed out, \"All these folks who are worried about inflation, even the ones who collect unemployment and want jobs, they live like kings compared to the poor people in Sao Paolo.\"</span></p> <p><span>It was not a bad question at all.  In reply, I tried to give her a short lesson on practical politics.</span></p> <p><span>\"Only people like us,\" I began, \"students, politicos, suburban liberals who aren't caught up in busing, abortion, Israel and imagined economic catastrophe, have the mental energy to worry about your South American friends.  Most people have all they can do to think about next week's paycheck.  They don't want to hear from Brazil,\" I said.  \"And the Brazilians don't vote in America.\"</span></p> <p><span>I assured her that Birch Bayh cared for the Brazilians.  It's just that he had to keep it a secret.  \"For a politician to espouse their cause would actually hurt them,\" I concluded.  \"It would lose votes.\"</span></p> <p><span>Somehow, the answer did not satisfy.  And well it should not have.  For the Wellesley College woman had struck upon a telling, perhaps the telling point of 1976.  The liberals could not afford to be so liberal this year.  No candidate could afford to talk about the forgotten masses in Brazil.  The voters wouldn't stand for it.</span></p> <p><span>In 1972, at least some were able to see beyond the immediate, and George McGovern ran on a commitment to stop an American outrage taking place against yellow and brown-skinned nonvoters 6000 miles away.  But that effort failed 49-1, and four years of inflation, unemployment, Watergate and otherwise uninspired leadership have made us a less generous nation.  It was not the fault of the candidates if even the people of that one lonely state had turned inward and seemed to be voting solely for themselves.  Whether it was the anti-busing Wallaceites who carried Boston, the pro-Israel Jacksonites who delivered Brookline, or the union mobilizers for Jackson in Fitchburg, there appeared to be an ugly, unifying theme throughout:  \"Me, Me, Me.\"</span></p> <p><span>No Democrat in his or her right political mind could afford to speak out continually for the truly forgotten people.  Nelson Rockefeller was vilified for not paying taxes like the rest of us, but not even Fred Harris talked about conditions at Attica.  Only Birch Bayh and Sargent Shriver talked straightforwardly and consistently about helping black people, and between them they garnered 12.9 per cent of the vote.</span></p> <p><span>So it was the advocates of lunchpail politics, no more busin' and Georgian efficiency who had a picnic.  And in the Massachusetts Democratic presidential primary of 1976, the disadvantaged had somehow slipped past the minds of the electorate.</span></p> <p><span>Although I promised myself at the start of this piece that I would not eulogize my candidate, let me just say that on the night that Birch Bayh lost, he showed himself to be the classiest candidate in the field.  His cool public concession in which he urged his supporters to pursue those goals upon which he had based his candidacy won him many votes after the fact.  And privately, in the upstairs suite at the Copley Plaza Hotel, surrounded by staff-people, volunteers, and the usual campaign flotsam, he exhibited unusual strength.  Moving from worker to worker, especially seeking out those who were weeping, he smiled, hugged and asked them to smile back.  An 11:00 p.m. bulletin showed him at 4 per cent, with Ellen McCormack hot on his tail.</span></p> <p><span>\"She's giving us a fight,\" grinned the man who had been picketed by right-to-lifers for the past five months.  Not a visible trace of bitterness.</span></p> <p><span>Throughout the ordeal he expressed to Jack Walsh and others a deep concern for his workers, especially those who, like his son, had taken time off from school.  For an extremely ambitious man who had never yet known defeat, it was not a bad performance.</span></p> <p><span>For most of us in the campaign there had always been the knowledge that Birch Bayh was, politically speaking, the best all around liberal Democratic candidate since Bobby Kennedy.  For myself, and perhaps for others, there had been a naive and ongoing belief in his invincibility, in the inevitability of eventual victory.  Massachusetts would keep him alive, and New York would put him over the top.</span></p> <p><span>So sure was his victory in my mind that I had set up a new scale for measuring political performance; not victory per se, but whether, once victory was achieved, the politician would be able to maintain his humility and compassion, or whether he would succumb to the sycophants and executive trappings--whether he would succumb to the arrogance of power that has destroyed some of our best intentioned presidents.  During the campaign, I sometimes wondered if President Bayh would have the strength to remember where he came from, but after viewing Bayh the loser, I know that he could have done it.</span></p> <p><span>I was in the counting room at 8:20 p.m., on a phone to the Copley Plaza, when the first precinct out of 2000 came in.  It was all over.  Bayh was running neck and neck with Ellen McCormack and Milton Shapp in a torrid battle for the cellar.  Udall was far ahead, and well on his way to earning the progressive mantle.</span></p> <p><span>Yet Udall's 18 per cent \"was hardly a crashing mandate,\" in the words of one major liberal Democratic activist, particularly in view of the poor competition he received from his single-digit liberal rivals.  His next primaries are not until April 6, and while he may win in Wisconsin, he has a long way to go in New York.  Henry Jackson is superbly organized there.</span></p> <p><span>March 2 was not just a loss, out a massive, mindblowing defeat for Birch Bayh, for Massachusetts liberals, for the voters who did not know better, for the nonvoters who forsook their chance, and for the poor people of Brazil.  Especially for the poor people of Brazil and for all of their American counterparts in Massachusetts and across the nation.</span></p> <p><span><i>Robert Gordon '76 coordinated the field staff for Bayh's Massachusetts primary campaign.</i></span></p>"}

{"title": "The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>American films in the late 40s and early 50s were dominated by a style called <b>film noir,</b> as the optimistic excitement of wartime Hollywood gave way to a bleak mood of disillusionment and introspection.  Directors turned away from the mythology of the American Dream to examine the darker sides of the American psyche: corruption, jealousy, greed, obsessive hate, and murder became crucial themes.  Billy Wilder's <b>Double Indemnity,</b> showing in the Orson Welles's <b>film noir</b> festival is in many ways a perfect example of the genre.  Written by Raymond Chandler, it stars Barbara Stanwyck as the sexy but neglected housewife who seduces an insurance salesman into helping her murder her husband to collect the settlement.  The languorous turns of the plot combine with the shadowy camera work to create a sordid, shabby world of moral decay.</span></p> <p><span>The best <b>film noir</b> showing this weekend is not part of the festival: Orson Welles's <b>The Lady From Shanghai.</b> Rita Hayworth, whose performance in <b>Gilda</b> so defined the fascinatingly sensual but dangerous woman of the period that her picture was painted an atom bomb, lures Welles into a deadly and mysterious web of murder and corporate intrigue.  The film's atmosphere, evoking a sinister world whose logic is not apparent at the surface, is exactly what Polanski was trying to achieve in <b>Chinatown.</b> Welles's eccentric camera angles are carried to new extremes which accentuate the uncertain character of reality in the film; in particular, the climatic shootout in a hall of mirrors is not to be missed.</span></p> <p><span>Capra's <b>State of the Union</b> (1948) is in no sense part of the <b>film noir</b> style, thought it too deals with political corruption.  The uneasy balance Capra strikes between his exposure of corruption and his reaffirmation is very much the same as that of his films of the 30s, like <b>Mr. Smith Goes To Washington</b> and <b>Meet John Doe.</b> While <b>State of the Union</b> is politically the least sophisticated of Capra's serious films, it is also emotionally the most exhilarating.  Hepburn gives the best performance of her career as the wife of Spencer Tracy, presidential candidate, who wins back her husband's love by convincing him to remain true to his principles.  When Hepburn plays opposite Cary Grant, we can't totally enjoy her charm because she se ems so manipulative, as in <b>Bringing Up Baby,</b> but here she is a totally sympathetic character without a hint of melodrama, and the result is awesome.  Tracy's political program is based on Wendell Wilkie's, but his campaign style conjures up no one more strongly than Jimmy Carter, showing the roots of Carter's methods of being everything to everyone in American political mythology.</span></p> <p><span>HARVARD-EPWORTH</span></p> <p><span>Hitchcock's <b>Lifeboat</b> today at 7:30; Pasolini's <b>The Gospel According to St. Matthew,</b> Sunday at 7:30.</span></p> <p><span>BRATTLE</span></p> <p><span><b>The Lady With the Dog</b> at 6:10 and 9:40; <b>Don Quixote</b> at 7:45.</span></p> <p><span>CENTRAL II</span></p> <p><span><b>Lies My Father Told Me</b> at 7:30 and 9:30.</span></p> <p><span>GALERIA</span></p> <p><span><b>The Story of Adele H</b> at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.</span></p> <p><span>ORSON WELLES I</span></p> <p><span><b>92 in the Shade</b> at 4, 7:20 and 10:45; <b>Rancho Deluxe</b> at 5:30 and 9.</span></p> <p><span>ORSON WELLES II</span></p> <p><span><b>Performance</b> at 4, 7:55; <b>Don't Look Now</b> at 5:55 and 9:50; Sunday-Tuesday: Frank Capra's <b>State of the Union</b> at 4 and 7:50; Howard Hawk's <b>His Girl Friday</b> at 6:10 and 10.</span></p> <p><span>ORSON WELLES III</span></p> <p><span>Billy Wilder's <b>Double Indemnity</b> at 4:05 and 7:40 and Nicolas Ray's <b>They Live By Night</b> at 6 and 9:35.</span></p> <p><span>EMERSON HALL</span></p> <p><span><b>Blood of the Condor</b> (documentary on the forced sterilization of Bolivian Indian women); <b>The Dispossessed,</b> Friday and Saturday at 7 and 9:30.</span></p> <p><span>KIRKLAND HOUSE</span></p> <p><span><b>Pride and Prejudice,</b> Friday and Saturday at 8 and 10.</span></p> <p><span>LEHMAN HALL</span></p> <p><span><b>The Lady From Shanghai</b> (Orson Welles-Rita Hayworth) Friday and Saturday at 8 and 9:30.</span></p> <p><span>SCIENCE CENTER A</span></p> <p><span><b>Autobiography of a Princess</b> (Asian film), Friday and Saturday at 8 and 10.</span></p> <p><span>SCIENCE CENTER B</span></p> <p><span><b>The Andromeda Strain,</b> Friday and Saturday at 7:30 and 10.

He said, in climate, none had ever died there A natural death.</i> Robert Frost</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b> GOOD REMINDER FOR the 38-year old Perfect Master of California, Edmund G. Brown Jr., that in his state, hardly anyone ever dies a natural political death.  The state \"so blessed in climate\" makes candidates flourish with the crazy progress of hothouse roses, then collapse and disintegrate with the frightening speed of a time-lapse photographic sequence.</span></p> <p><span>California casualties swoop down dead with more speed and color and frequency than any other state's: Upton Sinclair, Helen Gahagan Douglas, Goodwin Knight, William Knowland, Pierre Salinger, and of course, Richard Nixon in 1962.  It was Jerry Brown's father, cheerful stumbly Pat Brown who beat Nixon for the governorship that year, only to lose to Ronald Reagan the next time around.  There is no security in California politics-Pat Brown says that he \"rubbed his hands in glee\" at the thought of running against the \"fading, aging actor.\" Perhaps that is why the young Brown, with an 86 per cent approval rating in California wants to cash in some of his chips and get to Washington before the inevitable slip into the San Andreas Fault.</span></p> <p><span>\"I am very serious about it,\" Brown said of his candidacy for president, soon after he announced.  \"And while it may strike some as a bit unorthodox that a person in my position and age should be running, I think it is the virtue of my candidacy.\"</span></p> <p><span>Apparently, Brown's candidacy did not strike that many people as unpleasantly unorthodox-without campaigning, he finished higher in the Gallup Poll than either Henry Jackson or Morris Udall.</span></p> <p><span>\"Doesn't it strike you as strange,\" says Robert Scheer, the former Ramparts editor who spent three months watching Brown for Playboy magazine, \"that here's an S.O.B. who pretends not to be interested in traditional politics, and after a little more than a year of being in office, he's running for president?\"</span></p> <p><span>Scheer, his voice made hollow by several thousand miles of telephone wire from San Francisco warns, \"He's a sharp, cunning, ruthless politician.  And if you buy that mystic stuff, you're crazy.\"</span></p> <p><span>Lots of Californians have bought the mystic stuff by now, bought the wide-eyed gazes at the political system and the self-righteousness that went with it.  He has propped himself up as the apostle of \"lower expectations\" in America finding for himself a following cutting across all social and class barriers.</span></p> <p><span>\"I heard a chilling story a little while ago,\" says an old California politician.  \"You know how the California primary's gonna go? Here's what I hear: Frank Church and Brown split the liberal vote; Scoop Jackson and Brown split the moderate vote; Jimmy Carter and Brown split the moderate vote; George Wallace and Brown split the redneck vote.  That's 50 per cent for Brown and 12 per cent for everyone else and that's the future right there on the table.\"</span></p> <p><span>Brown's constitutency was not always so diffuse.  When he needed the Democratic nomination for Governor, he was a liberal.  He promised smaller classes in schools, bilingual education, more money for teachers and massive school improvement programs. Somewhere along the road he discovered the true nature of his state's temperment: on election night he would tell his father, \"I almost lost because of you.  People remembered you as such a big spender.\"</span></p> <p><span>Several months into his term of office, Brown was asking questions, as he had throughout the campaign.  Only now the questions had a different tenor.  \"Hot lunches for school children?\" he asked.  \"No one ever gave me a hot lunch.\" And: \"Why is it better to have a smaller number of students in each class?\"</span></p> <p><span>A mystique built up around the new Governor, legends sprouted.  He lived a spartan existence and slept on a bare mattress.  He drove to work in an old Plymouth.  He hated politicians, he never slept.  He meditated.  He read Hermann Hesse, Doris Lessing, Yeats, Kafka, Henry Miller.</span></p> <p><span>\"Crap!\" cries Scheer.  \"That guy never reads a book.  He's a politician.  He's...he's...\" Silence on the other end of the phone for a moment.  \"He's Sam Huntington! He's Pat Moynihan!\" Now Scheer, who as an Institute of Politics guest at Harvard led the famous demonstration which kept Robert MacNamara captive for hours, is livid.  The phone falls.  \"You don't believe me? Read the interview again.  He's a return to the politics of the fifties, the paranoia of the Cold War, enemies everywhere, too much dissent.  I know he believes that there's too much dissent.  Read it.\"</span></p> <p><span>Scheer's Playboy interview happens to be the most specific outline of Brown's beliefs to be found east of Encino.  It is a surprising collection of views from a man once viewed as a great liberal hope.  For instance, on military budget cuts, Brown says:</span></p> <p><span>I'd be surprised if there are dramatic savings to be made.</span></p> <p><span>On foreign policy:</span></p> <p><span>We ought to realize that without substantial military strength, we're obviously jeopardizing our security...I get the impression that we're being pushed around a lot and that America has become a big sap for the rest of the countries.  And I don't like it.  We should have a lot of strength, so I don't see why we should have guilt feelings and act like we're always the fall guy.</span></p> <p><span>On press disclosures:</span></p> <p><span>I have very mixed feelings.  There've been abuses; these agencies have gotten out of control...But in the process we may end up throwing out the baby with the bath water...the constant harping on things that have gone on in this government-I really wonder if they're that different from what'd gone on in other governments...</span></p> <p><span>On gun control:</span></p> <p><span>I wonder if the cure would be better than the disease.  We kill over 50,000 people a year in cars, yet I don't hear anybody talking about confiscating them.</span></p> <p><span>Still the Governor retains his liberal image, and there's no sign the jig is up.  Those years in the seminary may have provided extra protection for him-Scheer says that the guys up the street at his liquor store think the Playboy interview was highly beneficial to Brown.</span></p> <p><span>\"He's just got a great ear,\" says Scheer.  \"I don't believe he believed all that stuff he said in the interview about foreign policy.  But he liked the ring of it.  And after he repeated it a couple of times, it was part of him.  He gets people sold on him that way.  Passing off conservative politics and with that quiet voice and the mystic stuff.  You know what it is?\" He waits for an answer.  \"It's the ultimate betrayal of the Zen Revolution, the God that failed.  He's exploiting his spiritual training.</span></p> <p><span>\"Like with Jimmy Carter, he says Jesus gives him new spirit.  In California, all the most hustling businessmen do 15 minutes a day. Why?  Because it makes them more efficient.  It's the same with Jerry.  His Zen makes him more efficient, only in a different way.\"</span></p> <p><span>But not efficient enough to feel effective.  The most popular governor in the history of California takes the fatalistic line.  \"This is where we are in 1976.  The press is playing its role, the politicians are playing their role and the Greek chorus is out there watching it all.  That's just the way it is.  I don't think I can do anything about it, but it doesn't stop me from wishing it were better.\"  It's news to nobody that California is the place for lowered expectations-the end of the continent.  Even Zen Jesuits can't walk out onto the Pacific.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Jackson, Carter and Ford Win N.Y., Wisc. Primaries | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>NEW YORK--Sen. Henry M. Jackson (D-Wash.) took the New York Democratic primary yesterday with Rep.  Morris K. Udall (D-Ariz.) finishing an unexpectedly strong second, despite Jackson's having outspent him three to one.</span></p> <p><span>Jackson won a plurality of New York's 274 Democratic delegates, although he fell short of the majority he had predicted three weeks ago and again Monday.  \"We got our landslide, and we just missed a majority,\" Jackson told a crowed of about 150 supporters early this morning at the southern edge of New York City's Central Park.</span></p> <p><span>With 90 per cent of New York's delegate votes reporting, Jackson led with 105, Udall held 71, 65 delegate seats remained uncommitted, and former Georgia Gov.  Jimmy Carter garnered only 33 seats.</span></p> <p><span>Some Jackson supporters admitted disappointment with the Senator's showing in New York, where he had concentrated his organization and personal campaign appearances, while spending more than a half-million dollars.</span></p> <p><span>Matthew L. Lifflander, chairman of the Executive Committee of the Jackson campaign in New York, said \"I think Udall's the winner tonight.\"  Of Jackson's assertion that he would win a majority of New York's delegates, Lifflander said, \"Oh, well, he made a stupid prediction.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"We've won a draw,\" another Jackson staffmember said last night.</span></p> <p><span>In effect, New York held 39 separate elections yesterday, one in each congressional districts.  New York's stringent and complex proceedures for getting delegates on the ballot made it impossible for the candidates to field slates in every district.  Udall had slates in 37 and Jackson in 35, while challenges by the Jackson forces to petitions filed for Carter delegates left Carter with slates in only 27 districts.</span></p> <p><span>Daniel Patrick Moynihan, professor of Government, led a slate of five Jackson delegates to victory in the Bronx.  The sixth delegate elected in that district was the area's Congressman, Johnathan Bingham, who is pledged to Udall.</span></p> <p><span>Jackson never made it to the hotel ballroom rented for his victory celebration.  Instead he addressed supporters early this morning in the open air across the street, honoring a picket line of striking NBC technicans in front of the hotel.</span></p> <p><span>Aids of the Washington Senator decided early yesterday evening to switch locations, setting off a flurry of activity as staff members transfered sound equipment, a New Orleans jazz band, and a red and white crepe-covered flat bed truck to the street outside the hotel.</span></p> <p><span>Terry O'Connell, state campaign coordinator for Jackson, said last night the decision to honor the picket line was made \"when he was born.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"He's never crossed a picket line in 63 years.  He's not going to start now.\"</span></p> <p><span>Rep. Bella Abzug (D-N.Y.), who was elected as a Udall delegate in her district, said last night at the jubilant Udall headquarters that the Arizonian's strong showing in New York resulted in part from key endorsements of Udall by the New York Times and the New York Post, strong delegate slates often headed by Congressman, plus active support from the New Democratic Coalition and other reform Democratic groups.</span></p> <p><span>Jackson strength in New York was based partly on Jewish support for his stance on Israel and the Soviet Union's emigration policies, and partly on support from traditional Democratic politicians such as Mayor Abraham Beame and Queens borough president Donald Manes.</span></p> <p><span>Initial returns showed Jackson doing well in suburban Long Island and Westchester County, and relatively poorly in upstate New York.</span></p> <p><span>Former Gov. Jimmy Carter of Georgia, until last night the Democratic frontrunner, finished a poor forth in New York, well behind the Udall and uncommitted slates.</span></p> <p><span>Many of New York's uncommitted delegates are supporters of Senator Hubert H. Humphrey (D-Minn.)</span></p>"}

If, for instance, you are Carl Yastrzemski or Fred Lynn, it means five innings of baseball, a few wind sprints in the outfield, a quick shower, and the rest of the day off.</span></p> <p><span>If, on the other hand, you are Bob Heise or John Balaz, it means having to sweat out every ground out to third because it may be your last in a Red Sox uniform for quite a while.</span></p> <p><span>Regardless of your playing status, however, spring training is a month in the Florida (or Arizona) sunshine, a month of drinking freshly squeezed Anita Bryant oranges and Busch Bavarian beer.</span></p> <p><span>It is a month to work on tans, to predict whether you will hit .246 or .247, and to tell reporters that if everything falls into place, and the pitching comes through, then your team could be a real contender this year.</span></p> <p><span>From Winter Haven to Tampa, from Bradenton to Ft. Myers, nothing differs at the 24 major league camps save for the insignia on the uniforms and the fact that of the nearly 1000 players who arrive in camps at the beginning of March, only 25 will become World Champions in October.</span></p> <p><span>*****</span></p> <p><span>\"Yeah, I know where Harvard is,\" Pete Rose said as he awaited his turn in the batting cage at Redsland in Tampa, Florida.  \"Some girl on a game show last week didn't know where it was but I do,\" he continued.</span></p> <p><span>Rose, chicly attired in baseball pants and a tee-shirt with his picture on it, was skipping an exhibition game to take extra batting practice.  \"You don't get no fuckin' work if you play three games in a row,\" Charlie Hustle explained.  Rose said that he had only taken about 12 swings in the three games, but by staying behind, Rose would have many more opportunities to smack the white pill into the outfield.</span></p> <p><span>Other world champion Reds had the same idea as Rose.  Joe Morgan also took his turn in the cage and when he wasn't working on the baseball, he worked on his teammates.  \"Looks like I'm going to have to carry you guys again for the first month,\" Morgan chided some teammates.  Eventually, the talk drifted to contracts.  \"They had to sign me,\" Morgan contended.  \"They already put me in the press guide.\"</span></p> <p><span>Outfielder George Foster provided the play-by-play commentary while Bob Bailey was hitting.  Bailey hit a line-drive to the outfield, and Foster screamed, \"Oh what a grab by the centerfielder!\"  Then Bailey slashed one down the third base line, and Foster yelled, \"Brooks Robinson dives and gets it!\"  \"They're grabbing everything,\" Bailey responded.</span></p> <p><span>George Foster has been around professional baseball for a while and knows how to gear himself for each new season.  \"I relaxed over the winter,\" Foster said.  But even then, baseball is still on his mind.  \"I think about particular pitchers and how they pitch to me.\"  But once he gets down to Tampa, Foster says, he works on \"all facets of the game\" as well as conditioning his hands, wrists and arms.</span></p> <p><span>Foster had to adjust to another part of baseball, the multitude of fans and autograph seekers.  \"We have to try to set the best examples.  Kids idolize us.  We have to show that we're doing things we want to do.  But the main thing is to maintain health and strength.  We have a great chance of repeating.\"</span></p> <p><span>*****</span></p> <p><span>Sixty miles away from Tampa, the Red Sox practiced in Winter Haven, home of Polk Community College.  The Red Sox prepared for a exhibition game with the Montreal Expos by warming up their arms in front of the stands on the first base side.  Fans constantly yelled requests to the players.  \"Hey Yaz, look over here,\" one Instamatic-toting woman yelled.  Carl Yastrzemski obliged by looking into the stands for a second and then resuming his warmpup.  \"Hey Pudgie, I came all the way down to see you,\" a Bosox partisan screamed to Carlton Fisk.  Fisk trotted by and said, \"I gotta warm up now.\"</span></p> <p><span>The Red Sox found ample time to clown around.  Carl Yastrzemski played a game of dodgeball, ducking out of the path of the ball a fraction of a second before it would hit him as it sailed in from the outfield.  On the bullpen bench, outfielder Rick Miller and catcher Tim Blackwell engaged in a fierce game of hockey.  Miller used the handle of a bat and shot a baseball forcing Blackwell to make some spectacular kick saves as well as a few tremendous diving saves.  Blackwell also made good use of a rusty nail, poking his opponent to keep him out of the crease.</span></p> <p><span>After the national anthem, the players in the bullpen had to sit down and pursue less vigorous activities, such as imitating the umpire and blowing bubbles.  The home plate umpire bellowed his strike call very loudly, and Rick Miller imitated him for the first few innings.  After becoming bored of that, Miller took to blowing huge bubblegum spheroids that would explode on his face.</span></p> <p><span>During the bottom of the third, the Red Sox had men on first and third.  Expos pitcher Steve Renko tried to get out of the situation by faking a pick-off to third and then wheeling around and throwing to first.  The move didn't work.  Outfielder John Balaz, who sat in the bullpen most of the game, said that the move was the same one used by some Los Angeles Dodgers pitchers.  \"The Dodgers use that, especially in the minor leagues,\" Balaz said.  Less than one week later, the Sox gave Balaz the opportunity to see that move again by sending him down to the minors.</span></p> <p><span>The afternoon wasn't totally relaxed, however.  In the fourth inning, Gary Carter, playing left field for the Expos, chased a fly ball back to the warning track.  The ball hit his glove and then he hit the wall, made of cinder blocks deceptively painted green.  Immediately, the entire Expos squad dashed into left field and the chatter on the bullpen bench ceased, monentarily.</span></p> <p><span>\"Concussion city,\" pitcher Mark Bomback said as he walked over to the bullpen.  \"That's some bitch to hit that wall,\" another player said.  \"When he got up it looked like there was blood right here (pointing to his head).\"</span></p> <p><span>John Balaz recounted the time he ran into a chain-link fence during a minor league game.  \"I hit the crossbar, but I was luck I missed the upright because I would've been in real trouble.\"</span></p> <p><span>After about twenty minutes, the ground crew sent a cart out to retrieve Carter, and the entire bullpen left the bench to see the fallen Expo for themselves.  Carter lay on the flat back of the cart and a towel was wrapped around his face.  Twenty-five minutes after arriving in the clubhouse, a Polk Country ambulance took Carter to the local hospital for treatment.  \"Do I get the siren and all that stuff?\"  Carter asked the attendants.  \"Sorry, but no,\" one attendant replied.  Then as the door of the ambulance closed, Carter shouted to an Expo coach, \"Hey, save my ups.\"</span></p> <p><span>In the seventh inning, the public address announcer announced that Carter was back in Chain O'Lakes Park after having been sown up with 50 stiches.  Everyone cheered.</span></p> <p><span>*****</span></p> <p><span>The great thing about spring training is that it's almost as important where the foul balls land as who wins the games.  When a White Sox batter lofted one into the parking lot along the first base line of Payne Field in Sarasota, Pirates first baseman Willie Stargell turned to umpire Nestor Chylak and casually remarked, \"Somebody got a nod on his car.  Did it hit the top or the hood?\"</span></p> <p><span>*****</span></p> <p><span>The Red Sox and the Expos were tied after the regulation nine innings, and as the extra frames were about to begin, newly acquired Sox reliever Tom House strolled down the right field line.</span></p> <p><span>House had been responsible for holding the Expos at bay in the final innings, and was preparing to do a few wind sprints in the outfield when he was confronted by three reporters who were lounging in a nearby golf cart.</span></p> <p><span>\"Hey Tom, why didn't you take it easy so we could go home,\" one of them inquired of the John Denver look-a-like.</span></p> <p><span>\"Sorry,\" came the answer with a smile, \"but not at my expense.\"</span></p> <p><span>*****</span></p> <p><span>For the established players, spring training is a paid vacation, but for those who are trying to secure one of the last places on the roster, it's a time to do what you're told, and even then you have to pray a lot.</span></p> <p><span>\"Hey, you shaved it off,\" Montreal Expos outfielder Gary Carter, who was secure, said to Red Sox catcher Tim Blackwell, who wasn't, in reference to the disappearance of Blackwell's winter beard.</span></p> <p><span>\"Yeah, they said to,\" Blackwell replied.</span></p> <p><span>A week later, 'they' said good-bye to Blackwell.  He would not be spending the summer in Boston.</span></p> <p><span>*****</span></p> <p><span>An elderly gentleman sat on the top row of the Payne Field grandstand, soaking in the Sarasota sun and keeping tabs on a Chicago White Sox-Pittsubrgh Pirates doubleheader being played below.</span></p> <p><span>\"Excuse me, sir, but this is White Sox country, and you have a Red Sox hat on.  You must be a Boston fan.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Are you kidding me,\" he retorted.  \"I don't even know where Boston is.  This hat was given to me by a friend.\"</span></p>"}

{"title": "On Purity | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>HE 1968 presidential campaign of George C. Wallace can only be characterized as overly racist.  Wallace did not run on a major party ticket, did not expect to win, and concentrated on arousing latent racism among the disaffected.  In 1972, before he was injured, Wallace was campaigning for the Democratic nomination and appeared to stand a good chance of emerging as a major power broker at the Democratic National Convention.  This situation demanded a new political strategy, one which would appeal to a broader segment of the electorate, one which might be termed covertly racist.  As a paralyzed Wallace, employing this latter approach faded quickly in the early primaries of this new presidential season, Jimmy Carter, perceived by many to be the front-runner for the nomination, has moved quickly in an effort to co-opt the Wallace strategy and, thereby, the Wallace constituency.</span></p> <p><span>The starkest example of Carter's use of code-word racism in his search for votes came two weeks ago in South Bend, Indiana.  Carter said the federal government should not attempt to break down the \"ethnic purity\" of white neighborhoods by assisting blacks or other minorities to move to such neighborhoods.  He spoke of \"alien groups,\" meaning blacks, and with less subtlety, in a newspaper interview a few days before the South Bend speech, referred directly to \"black intrusion.\"</span></p> <p><span>But while these remarks may be the most obvious indication of a racist current in the Carter campaign, this current has in fact been consistently present.  Indeed as Senator Hubert Humphrey has said, heavily anti-Washington and anti-urban rhetoric is nothing more than the newest form of disguised racism.  And although Humphrey, in nothing this phenomenon, did not point specifically to any candidate, it is Carter who has decried federal aid to the cities, Carter who has spoken of the \"burden\" of welfare, and Carter who has posed himself as the anti-Washington force.</span></p> <p><span>The other major candidates, Senator Jackson and Representative Udall, have not been entirely clean on this issue--both have on occasion made statements similar to those Carter made at South Bend, and Jackson's blatant pitch for ant-busing votes in Boston was particularly deplorable.  But it is Carter who has carefully but deliberately injected the race issue into the current campaign, and it would be wrong to fail to distinguish between him and the other candidates on this question.</span></p> <p><span>The Carter campaign is then a dangerous campaign.  Carter should be defeated in Pennsylvania, and those who have supported him but would still wish to view themselves as within the American liberal tradition, should repudiate that support.</span></p>"}

His round, plump face certainly looked sincere, and with the aura of innocence radiating from his big, thick glasses and curly hair, who would have doubted him?  He was, after all, a 1973 Harvard alumnus himself, so he should have known something about the value of his Psych and Soc Rel degree.</span></p> <p><span>But something wasn't quite right.

And that chair Franken was sitting in--that was the chair he is paid to sit in and make jokes.</span></p> <p><span>A few yards away, another writer was playing a joke on Jane Curtain, an attractive \"Saturday Night\" actress.

He walked over to Curtain's desk and pressed the top of the quarter, which fell magically to the desk, and the writer walked away giggling, leaving Curtain to try to find a nonexistent hole in the glove.  \"Stupid trick,\" Curtain shouted as she poked the coin at the rubber.  \"What a stupid trick.\"</span></p> <p><span>Something was rotten on the 17th floor of Rockefeller Center.</span></p> <p><span>Finally, Franken's stoic expression collapsed and he broke into laughter.  \"I'd like to see something like <i>that</i> in The Crimson,\" he said.  \"But seriously, if anyone wants to make it in show business, well, it doesn't help at all to go to Harvard--not at all.\"</span></p> <p><span>He learned back in his plush chair and grinned because he knew he had made it, for a while at least, despite his four years at Harvard.  Nine months ago he had his big break, when \"Saturday Night\" producer Lorned Michaels discovered Franken and his partner, Tom Davis, in a Los Angeles nightclub and hired them to write for the live, 90-minute comedy.</span></p> <p><span>Since then, \"Saturday Night\" has be ome the most talked a out show since \"Laugh-in.\"  Its ratings have consistently climbed, and the waiting period for one of the 200-odd tickets to see it live is over four months.  Several of the regular actors, who bill themselves as \"The Not Ready For Prime Time Players,\" have received offers for movie or situation-comedy roles.  The standout comedian, Chevy Chase, is considered the heir-apparent to Johnny Carson (\"The Tonight Show\").  And \"Saturday Night\" has done all this at a fraction of the cost of a six million dollar woman.</span></p> <p><span>\"Since it's my first television job, I had to settle for whatever they could give me,\" Franken said.  \"It pays O.K., Tom and I are learning a lot, and it's gratifying to see our stuff done on television.\"</span></p> <p><span>He broke into a grin again, recalling his high school dreams of a show business career.  Franken and Davis first began writing together at Blake, a Minnesota country-day prep school, not for comedy skits or plays, but for morning chapel announcements.  Although they didn't \"hang out around the school theater,\" Franken said, they wrote together whenever they could gather up enough energy to put on a show.  When Franken graduated from high school in 1969, he had Physics in mind for a concentration--\"I was good at math and all that stuff\"--but show business dreams were far from forgotten.</span></p> <p><span>\"I never even took a single Physics course at Harvard,\" he said.  \"I had a real crisis freshman year, I just didn't know what I was going to do.  I guess I always wanted to do an act with Tom.\"  Franken paused to wave to Michaels and actress Gilda Radner as they passed by the office door.  \"Anyhow,\" he continued, \"my partner and I worked together for a couple of summers.  I guess it was the ones between my sophomore year and my senior year.  We were really lucky, we got booked in a place in Minneapolis.  Our stuff was good, but our performing was <i>so</i> terrible.\"  By that time Davis had quit the University of the Pacific, and Franken's show business dreams had overtaken his physics plans.</span></p> <p><span>He turned to a vocational aptitude test for reassurance.  Sciences came in near the bottom, while Camp Counselor finished first.  Counselor was immediately ruled--\"I can't canoe or anything.\"  Runner-up Music Performer was equally unattractive because he can't play any instruments.  \"Speech came in third,\" he said.  \"I figured show business was close to speech.\"</span></p> <p><span>So, knowing he would not be a psychologist, Franken spent most of his time at Harvard getting from one day to the next, always careful to keep his head above academic water.  He spurned the Loeb, the Lampoon and the Pudding to work by himself for Dunster House productions.</span></p> <p><span>\"The Loeb, well, that's theater,\" Franken said, frowning a bit.  \"I was just never into theater.  I was interested in real show business.  And the Lampoon--it wasn't just that I didn't like them, I thought the stuff they were doing was terrible.\"</span></p> <p><span>He recalled writing a skit called \"Seamen on Broadway\" that was rejected from the Hasty Pudding show \"by some preppie so they could take some other preppie's skit.\"  Franken started to smile again, but his tone was serious, too serious.  \"It's not preppies, cause I'm a preppie myself.  I just don't like homosexuals.  If you ask me, they're all homosexuals in the Pudding.  Hey, I was glad when that Pudding homosexual got killed in Philadelphia.\"  The smile became so broad it pushed his eyes shut.  He couldn't stand it any longer.  \"Put that in, put that in,\" Franken laughed, leaning over the desk.  \"I'd love to see that in The Crimson.\"</span></p> <p><span>Out of warm dormitories and into the cold show business world, Franken and Davis tried to get on television, but failed.  \"It's like people we get applications from who want to write for the show,\" Franken said.  \"They send us things, but they never consider what goes into a show.  They don't know what we want.  That's what happened to us when we started out, and it was just stupid of us to think that people were going to take things just because we liked them.\"</span></p> <p><span>Franken and Davis did discover what people wanted.  Their success came when they were still so young--Franken is 24, Davis 23--that comedians constantly caution them \"not to burn out.\"  Franken, sitting in his comfortable chair, was not disturbed.  His only worry, he said, was when he would get a vacation from his writing job, not to relax, but to perform stand-up comedy.</span></p> <p><span>A true \"Saturday Night\" fan will remember that Franken and Davis appeared on the show that was guest-hosted by Eliot Gould.  They were dressed as Indians--Franken was an interviewer, and Davis was the head of the Bureau of White Man Affairs.  The Indians had defeated white forces and won the West, and the whites were in the minority.  Davis told Franken that the whites were occupying Wounded Stench, but that white men preferred to call it Jersey City.  And Davis also revealed a white idiosyncrasy:  they loved intertribal jokes, especially about the greasy Italian tribe.</span></p> <p><span>The youth of the \"Saturday Night\" writing staff--the average age is 24--reflects the show's spirit.  A recent skit featured the hands of President Ford, (played by Chase) futilely trying to roll a marijuana cigarette and forgetting whether to pour, lick and roll, or roll, lick and pour.  \"The humor on the show isn't ahead of its time,\" Franken said.  \"Most of the people here have been doing this kind of stuff for years.  It's just that on TV you can't be as radical, so for TV it's new.\"</span></p> <p><span>Chase, armed with a naive countenance and trim haircut, has excited the comedy world with his Ford skits.  His athletic ability, coupled with Ford's athletic pursuits, adds a new dimension to political satire:  physical comedy.  Typical is the opening scene to the December 20th show.  Chase, as Ford, climbs to the top of a 15-ft.  Christmas tree.  While cutting off the branches--Betty told him to trim it--he stumbles from the ladder and falls spectacularly to the wooden floor.  As the crowd roars its approval, Chase lifts his head and yells, \"Live from New York:  It's Saturday Night!\"  The weekly fall has become Chase's trademark, and having a president with a reputation of clumsiness has all but shoved him into stardom.</span></p> <p><span>\"Weekend Update,\" Chase's mock news broadcast is the show's most popular skit.  \"It's the last thing we do,\" Franken said.  \"We throw it together around two in the afternoon on Saturday and add jokes throughout the day, right up to air time.\"  Much of \"Update\" is direct satire of occurences of the previous week.  On one newscast, Chase reported:</span></p> <p><span>\"This week, the FDA banned Red Dye #2, saying the red coloring agent is suspected of having cancer-causing qualities.  Coincidentally, it was reported this week that Ronald Reagan revealed he was undergoing treatment for cancer of the hair.\"</span></p> <p><span>Although Reagan and Ford are constantly ridiculed, they are far from alone.</span></p> <p><span>The FCC announced today that for every Ford commercial run on television, a minute of an old Ronald Reagan film must be shown.  As a result of this action, a spokesman for George Wallace responded by demanding equal time by showing one minute of \"Ironside.\"</span></p> <p><span>The writers often go a bit too far for the network, so an NBC censor reads the script before each show.  \"They've been pretty reasonable,\" Franken said.  \"Sometimes they cut things for really stupid reasons, but sometimes they let things through that I can't believe.\"  He chuckled and added, \"Like Wallace wheelchair jokes.\"</span></p> <p><span>The show's most deadly enemy, Franken said, is not controversy, but expense.  Production costs are close to $250,000 per show, extremely high for a late-night show.  \"Late-night advertising is worth less than prime-time.  They were thinking about moving us to prime-time, and you can't really say how it would change the show.  I have a feeling they won't do it.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Saturday Night\" fans will be disappointed to hear that NBC has scheduled only 11 live shows for the next six months, with reruns and other NBC features filling the lulls between.  In one eight week period, however, seven live shows will go on the air.  \"That's going to be rough,\" Franken said.  \"When we did four in a row, the last show--I think it was with Dick Cavett hosting--came out pretty poor.\"</span></p> <p><span>Like Cavett, most of the guest hosts are popular figures.  Candice Bergen, Paul Simon, Lily Tomlin and Anthony Perkins have appeared, and Raquel Welch is scheduled for next Saturday.  Tomorrow night, Ron Nessen, presidential press secretary, will make his show business debut.</span></p> <p><span>Franken was traveling with the candidates in New Hampshire before the primary \"just to see what politics are like.\"  He was riding on the Ronald Reagan press but, following Reagan's campaign appearances at junior high schools.  \"They were asking him questions like, \"Why are you running for President?'\"  Franken said, shaking his head.  \"So I asked him how he could be against decriminalization of marijuana and be against motorcycle helmet legislation because motorcycle helmets infringe of people's rights.  Then the assistant press secretary threw me off the press bus.  Reagan is just so bad.\"</span></p> <p><span>The trip was a success, however, because Franken met Nessen and convinced him to host the show.  \"We're not selling out,\" Chase told People magazine.  \"Nessen is an interesting host.  People are tired of seeing the same old craperoos, all the people you see on game and variety shows.\"</span></p> <p><span>Change is a controversial word on the 17th floor of Rockefeller Center.  Chase feels that \"Update\" should be used sparingly and that routines should be changed.  But \"Lorne feels that audiences are kind of stupid,\" Franken said, \"so he thinks we can use jokes every week.  I tend to think that our audiences are more sophisticated than most.  The way it is now, we'll just take a good joke and run it into the ground.  If we varied by only using a good joke once every four shows, we could use it forever.\"</span></p> <p><span>In the shaky world of show business, \"Saturday Night\" is unlikely to last forever.  But with costs decreasing with each show, it could run for several years, until, as Chase says, it goes down the toilet and NBC flushes it away.</span></p> <p><span>When that happens, Franken said he would like to return to stand up comedy work with Davis, preferably on the West Coast.  \"It would really be nice to work alone with Tom again, not having people assigning us things and not having things edited out,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>Franken got up to leave, because it was already 2 p.m. and he had yet to start writing.  He picked up a script from beneath his coffee cup, a skit in which Nessen leaves in the middle of the show.  \"Don't forget to put 'Kill all preppies' in the article,\" he smiled.</span></p> <p><span>It was hard to tell if he was serious.</span></p> <p><span><b>\"If anyone wants to make it in show business, well it doesn't help at all to go to Harvard.\"</b></span></p>"}
{"title": "Hard Days for OSHA | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b>N THE LAST weeks of 1970, Congress created a new governmental agency, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).  OSHA was charged with the task of safeguarding the lives and health of over 63 million American workers.  In signing the bill into law, President Nixon called it \"an example of the American system at its best.\"  In the years since its establishment, however, OSHA has been a major disappointment to many of its original backers.  In a 1974 interview, Sen. Harrison Williams (D-N.J.), then chairman of the Senate Labor and Public Welfare subcommittee and one of the co-sponsors of the bill establishing OSHA, characterized the agency as \"fumbling, bumbling; the number one administration bungle.\"</span></p> <p><span>Prior to the establishment of OSHA, most American workers were protected against hazardous working conditions only by state and local laws.  During the Johnson Administration, several studies were published that highlighted the general inadequacy of and lack of uniformity among the various state standards.  To remedy this situation, the Johnson Administration proposed a federal agency to promulgate and enforce a set of health and safety standards.  The idea ran into strong business opposition however, and no legislation emerged.</span></p> <p><span>The proposal was revived after Nixon took office in 1969, and in 1970 was passed.  This bill, however, differed significantly from the original proposal, which, strongly supported by the AFL-CIO, had given the Secretary of Labor the authority to shut down immediately any plant presenting an imminent danger to employee health and safety.  The Nixon Administration proposal, supported by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, required OSHA to obtain a court injunction to shut down a plant, and hence virtually eliminated the possibility of effective, immediate preventive action in emergency cases.  Also, the fines that could be levied for violations of the OSHA standards were smaller in the Administration bill than in the labor-supported bill.</span></p> <p><span>Finally, OSHA was directed to encourage the states to operate their own safety plans as long as their standards were at least as effective as OSHA's.  State plans approved by OSHA were to then receive 50 per cent of their funding from OSHA.  Labor unions were particularly opposed to these last provisions; they feared that state administration would result in a return to the conditions that had necessitated the creation of a federal agency in the first place.</span></p> <p><span><b>O</b>SHA AS ESTABLISHED still might have served fairly and effectively to protect the workers for whose lives and health it was responsible.  OSHA inspectors were empowered to visit workplaces without prior notice, making inspections in the event of an accident, the filing of a valid worker complaint, or at random.  For each violation found, inspectors were required to hand out a citation, which was to be posted for three days or until the violation was corrected.  For each citation issued, the inspector was required to propose a penalty (up to $1000 for non-willful violations) to be paid by the employer.</span></p> <p><span>Employers, in turn, could appeal OSHA rulings to an independent, three-member Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission (OSHRC), appeal for exemptions from specific health and safety standards (upon demonstration of equally effective systems or procedures), and, if they qualified as small businessmen, apply to the Small Business Administration for longterm loans to offset financial problems resulting from efforts to comply with the OSHA standards.  Finally, the legislation established the National Institute of Occupational Safety (NIOSH) within the department of Health, Education, and Welfare, to perform the research necessary to develop adequate OSHA standards.</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately, OSHA soon found itself hamstrung due to a lack of vigorous political and financial support on the part of both Congress and the Nixon Administration.  In the period prior to August, 1974, over one hundred bills amending the original OSHA act were introduced in the House and the Senate.  Most would have curbed the agency's enforcement authority; some would have gutted it entirely.  Furthermore, in line with the Nixon Administration's attempts to reduce the size and cost of HEW and other federal social welfare programs, OSHA and NIOSH received only small increases in their original, inadequate funding levels.</span></p> <p><span>Most of the opposition to OSHA reflected business's dissatisfaction with the results of the original bill.  Spokesmen for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce accused OSHA of promulgating many irrational, unnecessary standards which were related only peripherally, if at all, to occupational health and safety.  Compliance with the standards, business representatives claimed, would result in increased unemployment as small firms were driven out of business by the high costs of conforming to OSHA guidelines.</span></p> <p><span>A few of the standards OSHA promulgated were probably unnecessary--there was one provision which regulated the height of toilet seats--but the business community overstated its case.  As of July 8, 1974, no company had been forced out of business as a result of OSHA regulations.  Furthermore, the average actual per violation fine incurred by employers has been less than $26.  Most importantly, both National Safety Council and OSHA statistics show that small and medium-sized firms have the highest accident rates of all business, implying that such firms are perhaps those most in need of regulation.</span></p> <p><span>There is also some evidence that at least one OSHA administrator saw the political advantages in lax enforcement of legislation.  In a June 14, 1972 memo to then Labor Undersecretary Laurence H. Silberman (released by the Senate Watergate Committee in July, 1974), OSHA administrator George C. Guenther said that during the 1972 campaign period \"no highly controversial standards....will be proposed by OSHA or NIOSH...\"</span></p> <p><span>While I have discussed with Lee Nunn (of the Finance Committee for the Re-Election of the President), the great potential of OSHA as a sales point for fund-raising and general support by employers, I do not believe the full potential of this appeal is fully recognized.  Your suggestions as to how to promote the advantages of four more years of properly managed OSHA would be appreciated.</span></p> <p><span>Both Silberman and Guenther claim that none of the suggestions in the memo were carried out; their statement was challenged by the Ralph Nader-affiliated Health Research group.  Whether or not the Health Research Group's accusations are true, the fact that a relatively high-level OSHA official viewed his agency as a political tool suggests that some of OSHA's problems are due to a lack of commitment within the agency to the spirit of the original legislation.</span></p> <p><span>Thus in its first five years of existence OSHA has been hampered by shortages of money and manpower, and, perhaps, administrative sabotage.</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>HAT, THEN, should be done?</span></p> <p><span>First, Congress and the President should give OSHA a clear mandate to perform its assigned task--and back up this political endorsement with increased financial support.  Secondly, OSHA should undergo a thorough administrative housecleaning.  Third, NIOSH funding should be increased so that safe exposure standards can be developed for potentially toxic substances used in industry.</span></p> <p><span>Such steps would be expensive in the short run but would undoubtedly pay off in the long term.  In his recently published study of occupational health and safety hazards, <i>Crisis in the Workplace,</i> Nicholas Ashford writes that:</span></p> <p><span>...research in the U.K. indicates that more than 80 per cent of cancer is of environmental origin and therefore, theoretically, is preventable...The total cost of occupational hazards--in terms of lost wages, medical expenses, insurance claims, productions delays, lost time of co-workers and equipment damage--was estimated by the National Safety Council at $15 billion during 1974--approximately one per cent of the GNP.  This figure, moreover, is likely to be a gross understatement of even the direct costs to the GNP of both occupational injuries and illness.</span></p> <p><span>OSHA's 1976 budget appropriation is $115 million, and the figure for occupational safety and health research is only $34 million.  Both are certainly a far cry from the $15 billion which it is estimated an adequate program could save annually.</span></p> <p><span>President Ford recently indicated his dissatisfaction with OSHA and it seems unlikely that Ford's re-election would result in an increased federal emphasis on improving occupational health and safety.  None of the other declared candidates has emphasized occupational health and safety as an issue either.  It seems safe to say that barring a change of address for Ford or a sudden awakening on the part of his opponents, OSHA will remain an example not of the \"American systems at its best,\" but of business--and politics--as usual.</span></p>"}
{"title": "The Long Winter:  Uneasiness and 18 Losses | Sports | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Take a closer look at the eight wins which Harvard's basketball team managed to rack up this year, and you'll find that the season was every bit as bad as a .308 winning percentage suggests.</span></p> <p><span>Couple that with the fact that the Crimson roundballers were equally adept at losing to horrible teams and good teams, and Harvard's recent season comes into focus as one of the worst in the last few decades.</span></p> <p><span>First, to recap:  The Crimson victories can be listed in a very small amount of space.  Brandeis, Rochester, Brown, B.C., B.U., Yale, Cornell, and Columbia.  But that is just the tip of the iceberg.</span></p> <p><span><b>Judging the Judges</b></span></p> <p><span>Judging by records alone, Brandeis was the best team Harvard managed to beat this year, sporting a 10-14 final record for a whopping .416 winning percentage.  The Crimson's 87-78 win over the Judges doesn't stack up, however, when you consider that the Walthamites usually spend their time playing Division Three caliber opponents.  The 10-14 record, bad as it is, covers the fact that Brandeis is simply in an inferior league.  But a win is a win.</span></p> <p><span>Of Harvard's other seven victories, none came against a team with a winning percentage of better than .350. Rochester, defeated by an 86-75 count, ranks at the top of the victim list with an 8-15 (.348) log, followed closely by Boston college and its 9-17 (.346) record.</span></p> <p><span>Rounding out the abbreviated list are the old standby favorites, Columbia (8-17, .320), Cornell (8-18, .308), Brown (7-20, .259), Yale (7-20, .259), and Boston University (7-19, .269).</span></p> <p><span>Harvard managed to defeat these teams, as everybody else in the United States did, but Tom Sanders &amp; Co. have one leg up on the rest of the nation.  Harvard also managed to lose to five of the teams mentioned on separate occasions, negating whatever prowess might be attributed to the victories.</span></p> <p><span>The Crimson split its season series with the worst teams the Ivy League has to offer--Brown, Yale, Columbia and Cornell--not exactly something to write home about.  In addition, it went 1-1 against Boston College, a squad whose season paralleled the history of the Hindenburg.</span></p> <p><span>So what are we left with?  The knowledge that the only teams Harvard was definitely better than this season were the outfits from Brandeis, Rochester, and B.U. Their combined record was 25-48.  The Crimson's total of eight victories was amassed against teams whose final records add up to 64-140, or a .313 winning percentage.</span></p> <p><span>Taken by itself, the 1975-76 season was an unmitigated disaster, ranking Harvard's basketball program with the worst in the nation.  But was this year much worse than those gone by, a disaster when compared to the school's basketball history?  The answer is not quite so clear.</span></p> <p><span>This season included, the last 16 years of IAB basketball have produced only 4 winning campaigns, not an impressive record by any stretch of the imagination.  The composite of those seasons is 168-220, a won-lost record which accurately reflects the entire history of Harvard basketball.</span></p> <p><span>In 65 years of trying, Crimson varsities have turned up a grand total of 577 victories to go along with 730 losses.  In view of this, it becomes reasonable to suggest that there is no basis for expecting Harvard to come up with a winning season, much less a sound program that develops a tradition of winning.  In fact, coach Sanders alluded to this earlier in the year when he suggested that Harvard basketball players-students have too much on their minds to become successful on the court.</span></p> <p><span>This is hardly a novel outlook, nor is it devoid of any merit.  Most of the ballplayers on this year's squad will readily admit that they play the game more for fun than anything else.  Few hopes for professional contracts are maintained in the IAB, and the high-powered edge of big-time basketball is non-existent there.</span></p> <p><span>But the connection between big-time hoop and a winning basketball program is only a tenuous one, and the concept of the player-student often becomes no more than a facile explanation for a losing season at Harvard, one which evades the real question of why other schools can develop good programs and this school can't.</span></p> <p><span>There is no need to look outside the Ivy League for examples of a sound mix of scholarship and sports.  In basketball, Princeton of course provides the prime example, with a program that is respected nation-wide.  Penn is much the same.  And Dartmouth took exactly one season to turn its program around, racking up a fine 17-9 record after a disastrous year in 1974-75.</span></p> <p><span>It is not as if all Harvard athletes have too much on their study-oriented minds to perform well in their sports.  Mel Embree is a case in point, albeit an exceptional one.  As for team sports, what of Joe Restic's spectacular success with the football program (none of whose participants can really count on professional careers) and Bill Cleary's annual miracle-working with the Harvard hockey program?  In sum, what makes the basketball program different?</span></p> <p><span><b>All Bottled Up</b></span></p> <p><span>The answers to this question are bottled up in a season of dissension, unhappiness, and lost ballgames.  Harvard's basketball team was far from talentless this past year, yet it could not even once get it together on the court for an effort it could really be proud of.</span></p> <p><span>The second game with Boston College came close to fulfilling expectations, and indeed at the time seemed to be a turning point in the season.  With 20/20 hindsight, it is easy now to see that B.C. was suffering from the same problems of disunity which have plagued Harvard all season.  Harvard's 79-65 victory, by far its best performance of the year, is washed down with the honest realization that the Eagles were equally to blame for bad basketball on that night in the IAB, that the Crimson's finest showing must be swallowed with the proverbial grain of salt.</span></p> <p><span>If Harvard's basketball program is in severe trouble, it is nowhere better reflected than in the incredible number of close games the team has lost both this year and in recent history.  It is a constant point of debate as to whether tight losses reflect bad luck or a lack of heart in a team, but with Harvard the frequency has become alarming to the point of realizing that there is indeed something very wrong.</span></p> <p><span>For most teams, a game well played results in a victory of some kind:  for Harvard, good performance begets a one-or two-point defeat.  Yale turned the trick by a 63-62 score.  Dartmouth by a 66-64 count. Brown, 58-56. Fordham, 70-68. B.C., 72-71.  Tack on a few five-point defeats, and either Harvard is very unlucky or something else is wrong.</span></p> <p><span>How many close ballgames did the Crimson win this year?  The answer is one:  a 66-63 number against Cornell in the IAB.</span></p> <p><span>There is no question that the Crimson basketball team is ravaged with internal problems, as a losing season with a number of walkouts will quickly point out.  There are very few ballplayers on the team who are really pleased with the way the program is handled, and some who are prepared to say they will not play next year if conditions do not change.</span></p> <p><span><b>Piles of Problems</b></span></p> <p><span>The team is confronted with a myriad of minor problems, ranging from bent rims in practice, which are not fixed, to equipment which must be paid for by the individual players, and on to a communication problem which is quickly reflected in the style of play on the court.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard's basketball team is in a good deal of trouble these days, and the Crimson fans are tired of watching a team with absolutely no desire to go through the motions on the fifth floor of the IAB, playing its games with the spirit of a last-pace finisher.</span></p> <p><span>The problems are numerous, and they cannot be ironed out with a coach who is as ready to say \"No comment\" to his own ballplayers as he is to ignore the inquiries of outsiders.</span></p> <p><span>It's time for the Harvard basketball team to sit down and have a nice long talk.  Without some communication and honest discussion, it should prepare for a few more seasons which fit right into the history of Harvard basketball:  non-descript, losing efforts.  <h>THE WINS <t> Team\u00a0\u00a0Record\u00a0\u00a0Pct.

{"title": "Blame Massachusetts | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>One week after the corporate press had declared the quadrennial end of ideology in American politics--vide Time and Newsweek's cover stories on Jimmy Carter--Henry M. Jackson won the Massachusetts Democratic primary largely because of ideology.  That, and a bit of money, about $400,000, or almost twice the amount spent by second-place finisher and spender Morris Udall.</span></p> <p><span>There was little else available to explain the triumph of colorless Scoop.  Meanwhile, his talk of a restoration of The Grand New Deal coalition supporting his candidacy seemed inane, in that Roxbury blacks gave Carter a plurality, professional liberals flocked to Udall and even most Jews made Jackson only their second choice.</span></p> <p><span>But Scoop didn't need all those other groups--he had labor.  Blue-collar workers and their families, who make up more than half the vote in every large state, gave him impressive victories almost everywhere:  in Lawrence, with a long-time depressed textile and shoe industry, Jackson beat his nearest competitor, Carter, by 3-2; in Springfield, he topped Wallace by the same margin; and Worcester provided Scoop with a nearly 3-1 lead over his nearest rival.</span></p> <p><span>The state's 12-per-cent unemployment rate won for Jackson, demonstrated by The New York Times/CBS poll, which found Scoop's supporters most concerned with beating back corporations and giving federal guarantees for jobs.</span></p> <p><span>Jackson's anti-detente stance and a position on busing a shade to the right of the liberals may have been contributory, but certainly not decisive.</span></p> <p><span>Scoop's working class majority faded in only one area--Boston, where the anti-busing issue gave Wallace an edge.  But that small solace blinded most political analysts to the Alabama governor's spectacular failure.</span></p> <p><span>Never before has Wallace thrown so much time and money and demagoguery into an industrial Northern state's primary and come out with a paltry third-place finish at 17 per cent of the vote.  In Wisconsin, Indiana and Maryland in 1964--at the beginning of the cycle of violent ghetto summers--he won between 30 and 43 per cent against stand-in candidates for a popular incumbent President.  The fightin' judge won Maryland and Michigan in 1972.</span></p> <p><span>Moreover, the hysterical fears latent in the response to busing were counted on by Wallace's strategists to provide a massive public relations victory in this state, the nation's \"most liberal,\" as the governor stressed over and over.</span></p> <p><span>But the blue-collar allegiance to Jackson over Wallace--and the traditional liberal-oriented issues which Jackson voters stressed as reasons for their support--undercut the idea that the primary repudiated a liberal viewpoint.</span></p> <p><span>As for the \"progressive\" wing of the party, as Udall now likes to call it, the old blues dictum applies:  \"You may get better but you'll never get well.\"  With Bayh and Shriver all but out of the race, at seventh and sixth place finishes respectively, left field becomes mostly Mo's.</span></p> <p><span>That is indeed a mixed blessing.  Udall's support has so far shown itself to be upper-income and highly educated, concerned with ecology (many \"Friends of the Earth\" are in Cambridge and Newton) and the scarcity of natural resources, but not overly interested in policies appealing to the masses, like jobs and prices.  In short, it is the \"elite liberal\" formula that in another guise--acid, amnesty, abortion--led McGovern down the road to disaster.</span></p> <p><span>About Birch Bayh there is one lesson to be learned:  he was another tragic victim--as Stuart Symington was in 1960--of the Edmund Muskie syndrome; acceptable to all, the first and rabid choice of almost none (excepting the Harvard people who worked for him).</span></p> <p><span>Carter has the burnt-out, apolitical refugees of the '60s, Wallace has the frightened, Jackson the blue-collars, and Udall is the professors' choice.  Even Harris has the ideologically committed.  In primaries, strong interest-group support is key--coalition-building can take place <i>after</i> the nomination.</span></p> <p><span>And in the background, smiling crazily, is the candidate who wouldn't die, Hubert H. Humphrey.</span></p>"}

But there is no Marquis of Queensbury in Southern politics, Brewer got a little too close for comfort, and pretty soon Alabama voters were being handed pamphlets with doctored photographs of Brewer in between Elijah Muhammad and Muhammad Ali.  Pretty soon word went around that Albert Brewer's two daughters were pregnant with black babies.  Pretty soon Albert Brewer was back practicing law in Montogomery.</span></p> <p><span>Southern politics is tough stuff.

Who understands it best?</span></p> <p><span>John L. Rawbon of Panama City, Florida, has one answer.  A longtime admirer of Governor Wallace, he wrote the governor last month:</span></p> <p><span>\"The sickness that grips the northern United States has destroyed the image and ideals of our founding fathers.  Regrettably the country is being directed by money mad introverts...</span></p> <p><span>\"The media and religious groups are controlled by a rich minority that forces their biased views on the majority who are the back bone of this country.</span></p> <p><span>\"Fortunately the real Americans still live and exist south of the Mason-Dixon line...</span></p> <p><span>\"...the Confederacy still lives.  I do not advocate Civil War but legal separatism so the South can survive the International Rot that corrupts the world and especially the Northern states.</span></p> <p><span>\"Carter has betrayed you and acts like Benedict Arnold.  With friends like Carter the South has no need of enemies.  He gives every indication of supporting the religious minority moral values that will ultimately tear this country apart similar to Lebanon.</span></p> <p><span>\"It is my honest opinion that George Wallace can and will be the Saviour of these United States.  We can, with your leadership, stem the flow of rot that is beginning to seep into the South from the North.  It has already reached Nashville and is oozing like cancer through the Southern States.</span></p> <p><span>\"I nominate George Wallace, Governor of Alabama as first President of the Southern United States</span></p> <p><span>\"Yours sincerely...\"</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>HENEVER WALLACE wants to send another Albert Brewer to the showers, he wheels himself out and goes straight to the John Rawbons, spread over the dark inner continent of Florida.  Some people who venture into that dark interior which begins at the Everglades and runs up the center of the Thumb past Tallahassee and Chatahoochee find the Rawbons.  These are the Wallace people, who would vote for Wallace even if he were dead because of what he represented to the spreading rot of the North.  Last week Wallace said that he would consider a black man for vice president:  It doesn't matter.  It is as if there has been a secret pact in the Wallace campaign between the candidate and his electorate.  No matter what he says to the national media about winning scads of black votes in Alabama or accepting the law of the land, the implied message is in Wallace's wink--there is nothing to fear from the fighting judge, the Snopesian Benito Cereno who would take over the ship by crafty obeisance.</span></p> <p><span>Benito Cereno Wallace.  The wiliest slave on the slaveship gets a letter from a fellow passenger.  It is signed:</span></p> <p><span>\"Sincerely--J.H. Bigham (A cripple like yourself)\"</span></p> <p><span>It reads:</span></p> <p><span>\"Dear Governor--I am enclosing a personal check in the amount of $10.  This is all I can afford at this time.  I am supporting you to the best of my financial ability with my sincere hopes and prayers that you win the coming nomination on any ticket that you may prefer and also that you win the election.  Should this happen I firmly believe that you will be able to get the DAM loafers, deadbeats and chilizers off our backs.  I for one am dam tired of going to the stores and supermarkets and seeing these reciependents fill their baskets with the best cuts of meats etc, load them in Cadilacs and expensive cars and I and other peninsors having to shop around for pork neck bones, chicken necks, hog maws etc while they these Government reciependents load their baskets with the best cuts of meat and the like.  CRIME--is another thing that needs immediately attention--it is absolutely unsafe to walk down some of the streets here (Gainesville, Florida) in broad Daylight.\"</span></p> <p><span>Wallace's campaign is just as Joe Azbell, his chief strategist says, \"a revolution.  We're telling people that it's a revolution.  It's a revolution to do for the whites what has already been done for the blacks.\"</span></p> <p><span>But here is Benito's problem:  There is a fellow conspirator on board the <i>San Dominick.</i>  It was all right in 1972 to lead insurgencies against Hubert, Ed, Scoop and the entire army of crooked-bicycle-parkers that campaigned in Florida.  But Jimmy Carter, the Cheshire cat media mirage says he has only been to Washington to get on the tour bus and wants to wipe out the bureaucrats as badly as Wallace.</span></p> <p><span>Wallace just can't deal with Carter the same way he bludgeoned poor Albert Brewer.  Not only does he have to speak the sanitized language of the presidential campaign, he must as well watch Carter take a tip from Max Weber and take advantage of the routinization of his charisma, the routinization of his demagoguery.</span></p> <p><span>In the South, there has never been any secret as to what Wallace does when he campaigns, channeling bitterness into votes by transforming any land he steps on into an instant Confederacy, an instant defeated territory.  He opens the wounds in all who listen to him and promises retribution for slights that are hardly imagined.  As his admirer John Rawbon wrote, where Wallace goes, \"the Confederacy still lives.\"</span></p> <p><span>But Florida, which will decide today whether or not George Wallace survives, is hardly the South at all in many places.  It is the vacuum at the end of the struggle, the Muzak and Foster Grants at the end of the assembly line.  Jimmy Carter has perfectly simulated the essence of that Florida by treaclizing Wallace's deep fury, conducting a grinning rebellion.</span></p> <p><span>In the absolute center of Florida is the Magic Kingdom of Disney World.  In this well-designed universe, built for Carter's new crusade, incongruity is eliminated.  Photographers there find it hard to catch anything off-guard, because it is so well-planned.  Even J.H. Bigham (\"a cripple like yourself\") wouldn't have any trouble getting around or getting \"the best cuts of meat, etc.\"  In the center of Mouseville is the hall of the American presidents where 38 life-sized electronic dummies nod and fold and unfold arms while the Battle Hymn of the Republic plays on the sound system.  Ike and Harding and Lincoln and Uncle Baines stand there as dream images to be lit up every hour on the hour for a group that has waited in line for two hours to be able to sit inside for an electronically induced inspiration.  Jimmy Carter belongs on that row of battery-powered presidents.  George Wallace, half steel and wires already but pumping up his human hatred and vengeance four times daily, doesn't.</span></p> <p><span>Wallace will probably put together enough of his natural core to finish first tonight, but his percentages will be considerably lower than they were in 1972.  His issues are colder and the penny ante demon is on the wane.  He's been usurped and outmoded.  It's always dangerous to write political obituaries, but if Wallace isn't through for good in July, it will only be because one way or another he's linked up with that other charming anachronism, Ronald Reagan.</span></p> <p><span>Word is in Alabama that he'll seize ancient Senator John Sparkman's seat in 1978, lacking the strength to foist his wife Cornelia on the slate the way he could Governor Lurleen.  \"He'll go to the Senate,\" said one party power recently.  \"Folks'll want to send him where he'll be happy.  What the hell else would he do?  He'll speak for us, like he always did.  That's one thing about George.  He may never get to be President.  But he can always say what's on folks' minds.  Shee-it yes.  Y'all can say all you want about him, but he sure sent our message clear.  Shee-it yes.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "Ford Tops Reagan in Florida; Carter Edges Out Wallace | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter jumped into the frontrunner's position among Democratic presidential candidates yesterday by winning the Florida primary over Alabama Gov. George Wallace.  In the Republican primary, President Ford toppled former California Gov. Ronald Reagan decisively.</span></p> <p><span>With 92 per cent of Florida's precincts reporting, Carter had 35 per cent of the Democratic vote to Wallace's 32 per cent and Sen. Henry Jackson (D-Wash.) trailed with 22 per cent.  For the Republicans, Ford was leading Reagan 53 to 47 per cent.</span></p> <p><span>Ford's triumph culminates a monthlong downhill slide in Reagan's ratings among Florida Republicans.  A month ago, Reagan's campaign manager in Florida, L.E. Thomas, predicted that the former California governor would sweep the state with over two thirds of the vote.  Two weeks ago, Thomas revised that estimate to a 55-per-cent victory; and yesterday, Ford's campaign managers forecasted a \"more than 55-per-cent majority\" for Ford.</span></p> <p><span>Reagan's long-time abeyance from attacking Ford's policies went by the boards this past week as Reagan's strategists saw their candidate's early lead slipping.  The Reagan campaign strategy of coasting on momentum gained in the early primaries has proved to be an utter failure, with Ford's narrow victory in New Hampshire and solid win in Florida.  The future of Ronald Reagan looks dim.</span></p> <p><span>There were only bright lights last night for Carter, who beat Wallace in a state where the Alabama governor had pulled 42 per cent of the Democratic vote in the 1972 primary.  Carter has always maintained that Florida would be the test of whether he could beat Wallace in the South.  Carter set up his Florida organization over a year ago and since then has made more than 30 campaign visits to the Sunshine State.</span></p> <p><span>The Florida results are a severe blow to Wallace's hopes of going to the Democratic convention with the largest bloc of delegates.  Wallace matched his 1972 margins only in the rural, sparsely populated Florida panhandle, close to the Alabama and Georgia piney woods.  Carter won his largest margins, as did Ford on the Republican side, in the populous midsection of Florida, including St. Petersburg, Tampa, and Daytona Beach.</span></p> <p><span><b>Jewish Vote</b></span></p> <p><span>Jackson appealed primarily to the heavily populated Miami-Ft. Lauderdale area, where there is a large Jewish community, and led both Carter and Wallace in that area.  Jackson's 22 per cent showing was about what his organizers had expected.</span></p> <p><span>sylvania Gov. Milton Shapp failed to beat \"No Preference\" in Florida, drawing only two per cent of the Democratic vote after campaigning actively.  Three per cent of the Democrats pulled the \"No Preference\" levers, while Rep. Morris K. Udall (D-Ariz.) received two per cent without even campaigning.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Harvard Basketball:  What Does It Take To Win? | Sports | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>When Tom Sanders replaced Bob Harrison as Harvard's roundball coach three years ago, it was like replacing night with day.  Harrison was a believer in the \"win-at-all-costs\" philosophy, one which won him too few victories for the talent with which he had to work and a resignation slip after the 1972-'73 campaign.</span></p> <p><span>Sanders' entrance produced a drastic alteration of attitudes, yet one thing remains the same.  While the constant pressure Harrison exerted on his players in hopes of creating victories no longer fills the sweaty air of the IAB, there is now no pressure whatsoever on the players.  As junior guard Jonas Honick stated, \"Sanders lets us get away with murder.  He gave, and we took.\"</span></p> <p><span>What the players didn't take, however, was the number of victories which a team of Harvard's caliber should have produced, and herein lies the cager connection, the one link between the Harrison and Sanders regimes.</span></p> <p><span>Now It would be one thing if the basketball program was indeed at a loss for talent, a popular notion which most people around here are willing to accept, but this simply isn't the case.  The Crimson may not be Top Twenty material, but it certainly isn't Ivy basement material, either, and being in the cellar of the Ivy League in basketball is one of the greater embarrassments which any team could suffer.</span></p> <p><span>The Crimson cagers are in the basement, however, and they are embarrassed.  \"It upsets me,\" said senior center Mufi Hannemann, \"that people say we're not good, because we had the talent.  There are certainly some things that we (the players) could've done, but the coaches have to take the blame as well.\"</span></p> <p><span>And what the coaches have to take the blame for is a) a glaring inability to motivate the players, b) an entire lack of communication between themselves and the team, c) a lack of leadership, and d) a failure to realize that this is collegiate, and not professional, basketball.</span></p> <p><span>Sanders simply hasn't acquired, as of yet, the mentality which is necessary to coach successfully at a collegiate level.  The players cannot simply be told what is correct, an aspect of his job at which Satch excels, but they must also be motivated to do it.</span></p> <p><span>There has to be organization, and not the type which develops when you wait until November to elect a captain, when off-season practice is a farce, when regular season practice is almost as great a farce, and when there are never five players who perform together for more than ten minutes at a time.</span></p> <p><span>\"One of the reasons that this team lacked leadership,\" Honick stated, \"is that Satch prevents leadership from emerging.  No one is secure enough of his position to tell anyone else what to do if you aren't going to play with them for another two to three weeks.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>Commiseration</b></span></p> <p><span>Unlike past years, however, at least this winter the players were unified.  \"In past years,\" according to captain Bill Carey, \"fragments of the team were unsatisfied.  This year, we had a pretty even distribution of talent, so everyone was dissatisfied with his playing time, but we weren't disunited.  We were unified in our unhappiness with the program.\"</span></p> <p><span>Sanders hardly helped to resolve this matter by making a guessing game out of who would start each game.  Carey's situation is a case in point.  After opening the season on a scoring and rebounding tear, the senior forward suddenly found himself receiving less and less playing time.  As his on-court time decreased, so, naturally, did his statistics, which in turn led to an even greater decrease in playing time.</span></p> <p><span>Now Carey was only the best player on last year's team for the second half of the season, and he was this year's captain, so why did he deserve so much bench duty?</span></p> <p><span>Or how about Hannemann, who lingered on the bench for two and two-thirds years, despite the fact that during practices he would consistently outplay many of those who started before him.  Finally, Hannemann was given a chance during the latter stages of this season, and he responded with some of the best basketball displayed by any Crimson performer during this, the longest of many long winters of discontent, on the fourth floor of the IAB.</span></p> <p><span><b>Why, Why, Why?</b></span></p> <p><span>Why, then, was Hannemann only seen during pre-game shooting drills throughout most of the early-season schedule?  It is just one question among many which could be asked in the aftermath of an aborted season, one which would have been better off left unplayed, particularly when you consider what might have been.</span></p> <p><span>For while Princeton was undoubtedly the class of the Ivies, Harvard clearly had the talent to match the other six teams.  \"There's no reason we shouldn't have competed for the Ivy title,\" was Hannemann's appraisal, while Carey added that \"we should've been above .500 this year.  After the Beanpot I thought we'd win every game.\"</span></p> <p><span>Which, of course, they should have, but then again, let's remember with whom we're dealing.  Or perhaps that is the major question.  With whom, exactly, and with what are we dealing?  The players don't seem to know for sure.</span></p> <p><span>Both Carey and Honick mentioned how they've thought about what went wrong with the team for a long while, yet can't really come up with a satisfying, concrete answer.  \"There's a certain mystique about Satch,\" Honick commented, \"which  <h>The Season <t> Clemson\u00a0\u00a064-78\u00a0\u00a0L\u00a0\u00a018-10 Syracuse\u00a0\u00a070-83\u00a0\u00a0L\u00a0\u00a020-8 U.Mass.\u00a0\u00a087-99\u00a0\u00a0L\u00a0\u00a021-4 B.C.\u00a0\u00a071-72\u00a0\u00a0L\u00a0\u00a09-17 Fordham\u00a0\u00a068-70\u00a0\u00a0L\u00a0\u00a07-19 Brandeis\u00a0\u00a087-78\u00a0\u00a0W\u00a0\u00a010-14 Dartmouth\u00a0\u00a075-86\u00a0\u00a0L\u00a0\u00a017-9 Utah\u00a0\u00a078-89\u00a0\u00a0L\u00a0\u00a017-8 Rochester\u00a0\u00a086-75\u00a0\u00a0W\u00a0\u00a08-15 Penn St.\u00a0\u00a055-63\u00a0\u00a0L\u00a0\u00a010-16 Brown\u00a0\u00a073-66\u00a0\u00a0W\u00a0\u00a07-20 Princeton\u00a0\u00a057-62\u00a0\u00a0L\u00a0\u00a022-4 Penn\u00a0\u00a053-63\u00a0\u00a0L\u00a0\u00a017-9 B.C.\u00a0\u00a079-65\u00a0\u00a0W\u00a0\u00a09-17 B.U.\u00a0\u00a086-70\u00a0\u00a0W\u00a0\u00a07-19 Brown\u00a0\u00a056-58\u00a0\u00a0L\u00a0\u00a07-20 Yale\u00a0\u00a073-63\u00a0\u00a0W\u00a0\u00a07-20 Columbia\u00a0\u00a067-75\u00a0\u00a0L\u00a0\u00a08-17 Cornell\u00a0\u00a069-85\u00a0\u00a0L\u00a0\u00a08-18 Penn\u00a0\u00a075-80\u00a0\u00a0L\u00a0\u00a017-9 Princeton\u00a0\u00a048-69\u00a0\u00a0L\u00a0\u00a022-4 Cornell\u00a0\u00a066-63\u00a0\u00a0W\u00a0\u00a08-18 Columbia\u00a0\u00a092-83\u00a0\u00a0W\u00a0\u00a08-17 Dartmouth\u00a0\u00a064-66\u00a0\u00a0L\u00a0\u00a017-9 Yale\u00a0\u00a062-63\u00a0\u00a0L\u00a0\u00a07-20 Brown\u00a0\u00a086-101\u00a0\u00a0L\u00a0\u00a07-20  <p> <jfp>6\n</jfp></p></t></h></span></p> <p> <jfp>6\n</jfp></p> <p><span><jfp>6\n</jfp></span></p>"}
{"title": "My Senior Thesis | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>It went on for months, this falling asleep at four in the morning in a fiendish cloud of cigarette smoke, a rubble of beer bottles, light glaring and an Eric Ambler paperback folded across my nose.  It wasn't until I'd finished gobbling the 11th or 12th Ambler goodie that I realized what had been going on.  Not what was going on with the books--spy novels are easy enough to figure, God knows--but what was going on with me.  I finally caught on to the twisted logic grown up between the Ambler fetish and my dropping the Big One.  The Big One is the thesis, and it was as if this series of late-night thrillers was slyly supplying the same drama, the gut-unwrenching of four years of tension, that the thesis was supposed to.  And though I thought I'd licked the mythology of senior year's great ritual dance, it emerged that my subconscious had been a sucker for it the whole time.</span></p> <p><span>The mythology is a seductive one: generations of clever Harvard seniors have spun it out to justify generations of thesis-writing that often seemed to make little sense.  The basic theme is closure--rounding off, swallowing up, drawing a circle, grabbing the pouch of one's college experience and pulling the string.  A project, a <i>trip,</i> where for once you had time to lasso a confusion of ideas, grit your teeth and set your heels, tying them up before they escape and presenting the prize in a blue binder and a parade of marching IBM Selectric lines to show you've tamed them.  Pretty stupid, thought I... and proceeded to get seized by a brutal addiction to Eric Ambler.  I read every damn thing he wrote, practically (even a thesis has its tiny leaks), and I don't even have a magna to show for it.</span></p> <p><span>Thesis anxiety or not, if Eric Ambler's fifteen or so books were not so wildly interesting I could have kicked the habit.  Agatha Christie, who has all the psychological insight of second year algebra, couldn't have maintained interest like that, and if you've ever tried Rex Stout you'd know after three of four books that Nero Wolfe is really just a fat old fart.  Almost every collection of one-author-one-genre books gets repetitive after a while: critics betray this by calling thrillers a \"craft\" or a pulp writer a \"masterful technician,\" generally revealing that the formulas don't hold up for long and that while reading them is somewhat understandable in this cruel world, the activity is about as respectable as doing crossword puzzles or eating Darvon.  Life's little sordid pleasures.</span></p> <p><span>Defensively, then, I want to make like Roger Angell, who after revealing his obvious mania for baseball, commences a long argument about how there's nothing to really <i>care</i> about in this society anymore, and at least a good World Series brings people together in sharing the rarity of a strong and healthy emotion.  With similar protesting-too-much, I want to claim that Eric Ambler is, well, almost literature.  Riddled with the truths of human and historical behavior.  Not just a decadently engrossing game.</span></p> <p><span>Ambler writes novels of, um, \"international intrigue\"--geographical thrillers, you might say.  He evades repetitiveness because his genre can be made to have limitless possibilities.  You can only murder so many duchesses in so many English manor houses, but Ambler has the whole world to spy in.  And his leftist view of society (which is not incorruptible--more of that later) spurs him to take great pains letting the social conditions and political situations of his settings inform the way the plot works itself out.</span></p> <p><span>Take <i>Dirty Story,</i> for instance, which Ambler wrote in 1967.  Two European mining consortiums have extensive interests in two African countries side by side.  A secret expeditionary force from one country discovers valuable ore just beyond its borders.  They hire mercenaries to lead African troops in an effort to rearrange the border.  A down-and-out fugitive, our hero, is waylaid in French Somaliland (he is forced to leave Greece for getting mixed up in a pornography racket) with passport problems.  He meets a \"businessman\" and when effusively drunk he brags of a non-existent background in soldiering.  Before he knows it he is recruited and clawing through the jungle with a bunch of jingoistic thugs.  When I read about the British mercenaries commissioned to battle the MPLA in Angola a few months back, I knew the whole scene.</span></p> <p><span>Ambler heroes, who tend to be British engineers or American journalists with names like Carter and Latimer, always blunder into situations beyond their control, just as the reader falls from the world of the rational browser into the depths of frenzied addition.  Alfred Hitchcock has written about one famous Ambler beginning, that of <i>Background To Danger</i> (1937).  Kenton is a British journalist in Germany who has lost all his money in a poker game.  He takes a train to Vienna to borrow some from a man he knows there.  But on the train he shares a compartment with a man who eats sausage and claims to be a Jewish metallurgist fleeing the country from the Nazis, while there's still time.  He has the correct papers, but the authorities will not let him take his money with him.  Kenton is offered three hundred marks to take the \"securities\" across the border.  He accepts, the papers turn out to be something else entirely, and Kenton is caught up in a fight over oil-drilling concessions in Romania between corporate interests and governments.</span></p> <p><span>Kenton is courted by many spies in <i>Background To Danger,</i> but the one whom he trusts is Zaleshoff, a Soviet agent.  Zaleshoff is probably the most sympathetic character in all of Ambler's work--a shrewd and courageous servant of his government in the fight against fascism.  If it were not for his sister-and-colleague (the beautiful Tamara) deflating his ego and making him look constantly ridiculous (women in Ambler are often girl Fridays who see through the melodramatic illusions of men), Zaleshoff might be a bit much.  But he is the wonderful stuff of a racidal's fantasy nonetheless.  He reappears in <i>Cause For Alarm</i> (1939).  He cons a British engineer Marlow, (our hero) in Milan to do some unwitting work for him, and soon they are fleeing Mussolini's police across the countryside of northern Italy.  While hiding is a railroad depot they are captured, and the fascist official leaves the pair in a workshed under the guard of two railroad workers while he fetches more help.  To Marlow, the workers look sullen and threatening, but Zaleshoff begins loftily addressing the older one as \"comrade\" and humming obnoxiously.  Suddenly he lashes out to knock down the younger worker, while the older guard just stands there and lets them escape.  Marlow is confused until Zaleshoff later explains that he had noticed a tiny scar on the man's arm.  Italian workers in 1923 used to tatoo a hammer and sickle on their arms in the early days of fascism to show they didn't give a damn if anybody knew they were communists.  This defiance wisely abated, but Zaleshoff had guessed about the scar and had been humming an old Italian worker's song until he could tell that it was safe to make a break for it.</span></p> <p><span>Ambler was <i>the</i> popular novelist of the left during the thirties, although two well-known movies made from this period, <i>Journey Into Fear</i> (with Joseph Cotten and Orson Welles) and <i>Mask of Dimitrios</i> (with Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet), weeded subversion out.  But then Ambler changed.  After 1940 he didn't write a book for eleven years.  He was in charge of propaganda films for the British Army until 1946, and spent a few years writing screenplays (e.g., Monsarrat's <i>The Cruel Sea</i>).  In 1951 a disillusioned Ambler, returned with <i>Judgement on Deltchev,</i> about a political trial in Eastern Europe under rather totalitarian circumstances.  Though careful not to directly criticize the Soviet Union, Ambler portrays political ideologies as a sham--deluded masses being used as a front to cloak the sinister intentions of the rich and powerful.</span></p> <p><span>Although individuals could show human values, anyone in a large group was only a pawn in the game.  Even the liberal Dubcek figure in <i>Deltchev</i> turns out to be bogus--a political opportunist.  Given the climate of the times, Ambler found himself a pawn as well:  I found an old early fifties 25-cent paperback which screams,</span></p> <p><span>Nightmare in Red!  <b>Judgment on Deltchev</b> is the story of a nightmare... of one man's terrifying passage into the mad world of Communist violence, intrigue and murder.</span></p> <p><span>Soon after Ambler wrote <i>State of Siege,</i> set in Southeast Asia, where he made it clear that he at least sympathized with indigenous leftist forces in the third world.  But before long that hope, too, was gone.  Ambler's heroes now tend to look out for number one, and more and more of them are international hybrids lost in a sea of vicious superpowers.</span></p> <p><span>Ambler's old practice of humanizing his heroes by having them blunder into dangerous situations had become a tendency to portray his protaganists as, well, creeps.  Like Arthur Abdul Simpson, the hero of <i>Dirty Story,</i> who is first introduced in <i>The Light of Day.</i>  There he is blackmailed by a jewel ring into smuggling guns, and in turn blackmailed by the Turkish police into infiltrating the mob (a decent film, <i>Topkapi,</i> was made from this; Peter Ustinov made an excellent creep).  Anyway, Simpson is the son of a British army man stationed in Cairo and an Egyptian woman.  They are long dead and Simpson, who bears some rather sick grudges from his experiences at English boarding schools, is a bitter and nationless failure.  He is married to a young dancer who sleeps around on him.  He is old, overweight, and cowardly.  He is also a petty crook, who acts as a driver for rich businessmen, meeting them at the Athens airport, showing them the sights (including a brothel with which he has connections), and eventually fleecing them of their traveller's checks while they are enjoying the fleshpots of the city.</span></p> <p><span>Simpson is weak and paranoid because he has a right to be, Ambler seems to be saying--you need animal cunning to get through these days, and this is Simpson's only virtue.  There is no need for the facile theme of having Simpson discover his \"manhood\" through his experiences--only Simpson feeling immensely pleased with himself at the end of <i>Dirty Story</i> for hitting an armed man from behind with a blunt instrument.</span></p> <p><span>In <i>The Levanter</i> (1972), the hero is Michael Howell, a businessman in Syria who has a Cypriot mother and a Lebanese-Armenian grandmother.  He calls himself a \"Levantine mongrel,\" and he spend this time working out deals with a corrupt government to make profits for his company.  All this until he falls in with a band of Palestine guerillas.  This band may have been fighting for the liberation of their people at one time, but in Ambler's world they are now no more than thugs parading under false pretences.  And the Israeli secret service is almost as bad.</span></p> <p><span>In <i>The Intercom Conspiracy</i> the hero is an editor with a drinking problem and so much alienation that he edits a right-winganti-communist newsletter run by a crazed American general:  he falls into a plot by two bored intelligence officers in western Europe to disrupt NATO.  The CIA, the KGB and other intelligence services get involved, and Ambler's knowledge of how these organizations operate--the old-boy networks; using journalists as front men--is so extensive that recent revelations about the CIA are old hat.</span></p> <p><span>Ambler shares some of his hero's flaws, and he is cynical enough to know it.  Obviously he is much <i>too</i> cynical.  There are some elements of imperial Britain in his attitude--Arabs tend to smell, for example, and Americans are vulgar and prone to cowboy delusions.  There is a mystifying section in <i>The Schirmer Inheritance</i> where a woman whose family has been killed by the Gestapo--a rabid German-hater--falls passionately in love with a dominant and brutal ex-Nazi, as though this is the other side of the coin.  But in general Ambler has a wide and realistic understanding of how the world works:  each book is rich in historical detail, psychological insight, and another added element which might be called technique--How to do things.  The \"hero\" of <i>Passage of Arms</i> is a shipment of guns originating with communist Chinese guerillas and followed through several countries en route to anti-communist terrorists in Indonesia.  You learn how to run guns.  I also learned (from <i>The Levanter</i>) how to build a bomb.</span></p> <p><span>What's more, Ambler has something that I've never encountered in a one-author marathon.  Most prolific scribes have annoying catch-phrases that they use over and over, or favorite weird words.  You get to feel you're on to them.  But Ambler has the effortless writing skill of a British education.  His style is sure and undistracting--it goes down easier than lemonade in August.  By the gallon.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Thesis Madness | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b>T IS, OF COURSE, no news to seniors that March is the month when the really heavy deals go down.  Even non-seniors seem to sense this gloom as conversation among seniors becomes more and more impoverished, turning and returning to the nominations for this and that, applications for such and such, transcripts, interviews with large corporations, whether to lithograph one's resume or simply have it xeroxed.  For once, they have to give up their celebrated \"free flow of ideas\" and knuckle down to the bare facts of who's getting what and how.</span></p> <p><span>But the question that can cause actual spasms is:  \"How is <i>it</i> going?\"  where \"it\" refers to the thesis.  History and Lit majors--myself included--are like those kids in grammar school whose names begin with \"A\"--they must go first, but their anxiety ends earliest.  Either they have already typed, bound, and submitted their masterworks or have by now been accepted somewhere--unless they decided long ago to cut a deal with the Department and give it up untried.  But, as with the rest of that grammar school class, the bell will be tolling for other seniors at intervals the rest of March and into April.  And for those souls, typewriters, legal pads, note cards, and Korrect-type now provide the texture of their days and nights.</span></p> <p><span>One may well wonder what would move otherwise deliberate, sensual, more-or-less well-adjusted people to bug out their eyes, desert their beds and friends, and throw down large doses of industrial strength instant Maxwell House.  For some, (and such matters are impossible to quantify) a senior thesis is a pleasant opportunity, to write a truly trenchant essay concerning some topic of major interest.  But for many others, those for whom the process is a pall on their lives and for whom the process is a pall on their lives and for whom the product has no meaning, the motive force lies not in any positive desire but in \"The Fear.\"</span></p> <p><span>In the old days, tutors are fond of remembering, seniors also wrote theses and in great numbers--back, that is, before the counter-culture, Kissinger and the permanent recession.  But those theses, we are told, were different they were generally thought of as broad, even speculative essays on a major problem within a field.  Students were supposed to look back on their field and direct their analytical or synthetic juggernauts at a problem of major importance.  Seniors are remembered writing on Shakespeare or Milton rather than on bad novels by obscure madmen; they reflected on the Civil War or the New Deal instead of detailing the rise and fall of this or that isolated phenomenon.</span></p> <p><span>The point is not that certain subjects were formally out of bounds for theses or that obscure materials did not sometimes contribute to understanding, but that an <i>undergraduate</i> thesis served a special function.  Seniors were not expected to write as trained academics, generating original research available to other scholars.  They were not expected to do so precisely because they were not trained academics and because their work would never reach other scholars.  Nor did they typically have the time or money for travel that good, in-depth original research requires.</span></p> <p><span>But several things have come along to smash that old conception--Kissinger for one.  When he rose to power, after he became the long-distance thesis champ at Harvard, the word went out, at least in the social sciences:  more is better.  So, as an indirect result of his compulsion, seniors now often pick a length and try to fill it rather than pick an argument and write to an appropriate length.  A trained scholar would, of course, recognize this approach as bogus for the purposes of good writing, although a goodly number of them seem intent on doing it themselves.</span></p> <p><span>So the question for seniors became how to fill a given number of pages.  Put this way, the senior thesis metamorphosed into the senior-long-research-paper and was that much less attractive.  But at this point we must digress for a moment.  Parallel to the development of the long specialist paper came two other changes that, taken together, tend to heighten seniors' ambivalence about this new monster.  One was the growth of an ideology that holds that student life must be fun every minute.  This belief has a surprisingly diverse constituency, running from jocks to aristocrats to the endangered Harvard hipsters.  For these people, the idea of so much deferred gratification seems simply unbearable:  a thesis is a drag--besides, the world might blow up before I finish.</span></p> <p><span>But on the other hand rose the specter of a permanently tight job market for liberal arts majors.  The traditional sources of jobs--the ministry, government service, or professional training--are all trouble spots these days for a lot of people.  After teaching its students rationalism and skepticism for four years.  Harvard can hardly expect its graduates to look favorably on the ministry.  For other reasons, all kinds of undergraduates look on government service as some kind of bad joke, leaving only professionalism from among the traditional callings.  Law school, to be sure, seems to be gaining ground, but graduate school isn't even holding its own.  Many students, of course, are simply not inclined.  But for those who are, there just aren't enough seats: they not only say cutback, they do it.  And even if you don't think the recession is permanent--though there is every reason to think so--there simply won't be as many students in the generation behind us who will need teachers, making the prospect of graduate study more and more remote for more and more graduating seniors.</span></p> <p><span>The result of these developments is increased anxiety among undergraduates about what the hell they can do in this society after they graduate.  Which leads us directly back to the business of senior theses.  Although their form and the context in which they are written have changed, theses still are written--more this year than last.  Seniors claim to hate doing them, and while some seem to protest too much, most say it with real conviction.  The question of why thus leads us directly back to \"The Fear.\"</span></p> <p><span>This fear is really a cluster of related fears.  The perceived suffering is particularly acute these days because seniors must confront not only the usual threats of disappointing themselves, their parents, and their advisors, but because the changes in the economy and the society leave them fewer and fewer places to go.  After all, these seniors who drop their theses immediately after admission to law school or grad school can't say with much conviction that they were in it for the love of scholarship.  And considering what a drag it in fact is to produce one of these hundreds-of-pages-detailed-research jobs, you can hardly blame them.</span></p> <p><span>So what is to be done?  One could, of course, try to change the broader context and create full employment and positions in society for liberal arts majors before this year's juniors begin their own thesis madness.  But the Carter and Ford victories in Florida do not bode well for either.  Alternately, the departments ought to start rethinking theses, and potential thesis writers ought to look before they leap at what lies at the end of that road of Korrect-type, coffee, and note cards.</span></p> <p><span>A word to both the dedicated and the neurotic: the Coop has some great, cheap covers over on the right wall near the notebooks.</span></p>"}

Sheehan, research fellow for the Center for International Affairs, obtained classified memoranda of the negotiations, and aired the issue of Kissinger's possibly self-serving pretense of investigations of a State Department leak.</span></p> <p><span>Yesterday, a spokesman for the State Department announced that Kissinger has \"severely and officially\" reprimanded Alfred Atherton, assistant secretary of State for Middle and Far Eastern Affairs, for discussion classified memoranda of conversations compiled during the Middle East talks.</span></p> <p><span>Lawrence Eagleburger, Under Secretary of State for Management, said Kissinger's letter of reprimand will be placed on Atherton's personnel file, and that a department official under Atherton, Harold Saunders, has also been reprimanded for reading classified memoranda to Sheehan at Atherton's direction.</span></p> <p><span>According to Eagleburger's statement, furthermore, Atherton made the decision on his own as to what information he disclosed to Sheehan and how he disclosed it.  Kissinger originally gave him only general approval to give Sheehan background briefings on the Middle East talks, Eagleburger said.</span></p> <p><span>However, in a New York Times oped column published Monday, William Safire wrote that Kissinger must have known exactly what information Sheehan received.

The host of \"Death Valley Days,\" a former B-movie actor named Ronald Reagan, is creeping through the desert, dazed by the blazing sun, in hot pursuit of a desperado.  Ronnie sweats under the bright lights, shivers a little, and wilts in the heat.  Reagan's trigger finger is itchy, but it's past time.  The vultures are hovering.</span></p> <p><span>The desperado Reagan was chasing in the Florida primary was only Gerry Ford, stumbling, bumbling, but still president--and staid Republicans love their incumbents.  Reagan got his voters committed early--it looked like he was off to a steaming start--but the Republicans on the patios sat back undecided and finally, safely, went to Ford.  Reagan wilted, 53-47.</span></p> <p><span>Even the Wall Street Journal, which had editorialized for months against Ford's \"misrepresentations\" of Reagan's positions, saw the light and the Reagan fade.  Two days ago, the Journal ran a full-column-plus article on the disintegration of Reagan's campaign strategy, with all sorts of desperate-sounding quotes from campaign managers.</span></p> <p><span>On the Democratic side, Jimmy Carter won the Florida primary with the same \"winner\" tactics he's been using for a year now:  don't say anything, don't take stands, don't offend anyone, smile.  The polyester business people across Florida's midsection, centered on Disneyworld in Orlando, went for Carter because they perceived him as the candidate least likely to make changes.</span></p> <p><span>Carter also took most of the liberal vote in Florida.  It was a sad-and-sick-and-sunk-amongst-the-sharks liberal vote, but the idea was to stop Wallace, and stop Wallace they did.  George Wallace drew only 31 per cent of the Democratic vote, against Carter's 34 in a state where he swamped the field with 42 per cent in 1972.</span></p> <p><span>With Wallace and Carter, the story is their personalities.  With Scoop Jackson, who has no personality, the only story is his money.  Jackson ran for president in 1972, and raked in the campaign funds from American Jews (who like his hard line on detente and Soviet emigration), such home-state companies as Boeing, and old-line Democratic givers.  Jackson kept up the fund-raising effort even after his 1972 campaign folded--so that he came into 1976 with more money than anyone else--most of it large gifts from before the Campaign Practices Act, which limited gifts to $5000, went into effect.</span></p> <p><span>But the financial crunch is hard on candidates as well as on cities.  Bayh has closed shop, Harris is suspending activity for two months to raise money, Udall is spending the next month before Wisconsin soliciting funds, Wallace owes hundreds of thousands to his direct-mail firm, Carter is out there hustling short on cash.  Jackson is no exception--he had $1.5 million cash on hand as of February 1--on February 28 he had $260,000.</span></p> <p><span>New York is the payoff--Jackson did well in Massachusetts, and about as expected in Florida--but will Moynihan's endorsement play in Rochester?  More than one liberal Democrat is worried about Jackson's foreign policy--their line is that Scoop's the one to start World War III.  Jackson still has some liabilities from his bald-eagle stance of the Vietnam years.  And yesterday three labor leaders, including Victor Gottbaum in New York, former Bayh campaigners, came out for Udall.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Cerberus of the Right | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>On the surface, George F. Will is an enigma, a man of contradictions and paradoxes who doesn't fit into any neat compartments.  He is a Washington Post columnist who praises Gerald Ford more often than he damns him; a National Review editor who frequently ridicules Ronald Reagan; a conservative who decided Richard Nixon was guilty of impeachable crimes more than a year before his resignation; and an academic who, at least until recently, called himself a Republican, and who traces the origin of his conservative outlook to his disappointments as a youthful fan of the Chicago Cubs.  If there is a key to understanding him, it seems to be his fundamental pessimism.  He intends to write a book someday called <i>The Decline and Fall of Everything</i>.</span></p> <p><span>That pessimism is abstract, based, he says, on his conceptions of the nature of man and history.  It certainly isn't derived from his personal success or prospects.  His thrice-weekly column is currently syndicated in some 140 newspapers, and he writes a biweekly column for Newsweek that began last week.  He is a regular commentator on a Washington TV station, and frequently appears on PBS's \"Agronsky and Company\".  He has already established himself as one of the most sophisticated conservative thinkers in the country--much more complex and coherent than William F. Buckley Jr., immeasurably superior to the like of Kevin Phillips and James J. Kilpatrick.  Will is, moreover, one of the most literate and elegant prose stylists in American journalism.</span></p> <p><span>The private Will has little of the charm and elegance of Will the writer.  An unimposing six-footer with reddish hair and rimless glasses, he is given to casual dress and succinct answers that often consist of a single word or a single sentence.  Self-confident to the point of arrogance, often curt, Will gives the impression of a man uninclined to suffer gools, gladly or otherwise.  He answers questions in a monotone, seldom showing even a hint of emotion, except when he emphasizes a point by tapping a pencil on the desk in front of him.</span></p> <p><span>It takes some prodding to get Will to discuss his general philosophical outlook.  Asked what his major intellectual influences have been, he says with a slight, sardonic smile, \"That's an invitation to be pompous or obscure.  If you say Irving Kristol and Aristotle, you're probably both.\"  But he admits to being a conservative, with some qualification.  \"That's a somewhat richer and more complicated tradition than some conservatives.  I'm not a Lockean.  I'm more a Burkean,\" he says, distinguishing himself from other more libertarian conservatives like Barry Goldwater and Milton Friedman.  Of the former, he observes, \"He's a philosophic radical.  He is, as Hayek is, a classic Whig or liberal.  Goldwater is the most optimistic American.  He believes that he knows how to produce a kind of frictionless, progressive society.  He's as American as Hubert Humphrey--they both are great believers that they know how to make crooked things straight.\"</span></p> <p><span>Will's outlook is, in his view, fundamentally different from that of Goldwater; he contends that \"the core of liberalism is a certain optimism, and the core of a proper conservatism is a certain Augustinian pessimism.  Nothing seems to me more demonstrably untrue--demonstrable from the received experience of the race that we call history--than the optimism that pervades such enjoyable texts as Mill's <i>On Liberty</i> and Milton's <i>Areopagitica</i>--that is, if you just let truth and falsehood fight, falsehood will be beaten.\"  He laughs, a rare indulgence.  \"That's refuted on every page.  Falsehood has lots of advantages.  There are a lot more forms of it than there are forms of truth.  An awful lot of truths are not very pleasant, and don't make people happy.  The first requirement of an idea that's going to succeed is that it make people happy, not that it be true.\"</span></p> <p><span>But Will is a political critic, not a philosopher, and his sharpest opinions conern present-day events.  He originally came to Washington as a counsel to the Republican Policy Committee of the Senate, from the University of Toronto, where he taught political philosophy.  Though he says he has never voted for a Democrat, he no longer regards himself as a Republican.  \"Watergate largely cured me\", he says.  \"I think the party disgraced itself.  The general line is that Watergate wasn't a party matter; it was a Nixon matter.  It <i>was</i> a party matter:  it was a party test, and the party failed it.  Had the shoe been on the other foot, the Democrats would have failed as miserably, but they didn't.  Life's unfair and life put the shoe on the Republicans' foot.\"  He describes Nixon as \"the worst president the country ever had,\" but doesn't hesitate to admit a general, if rather vague agreement with Nixon's policies, citing with sympathy what he calls Nixon's \"general sense of dissatisfaction about the flow of government power in the last forty years, a sense that, particularly in the sixties, it got out of hand--a sense of limits, basically.\"</span></p> <p><span>Will's evaluation of President Ford is similarly balanced.  He contends that Ford, like any politician, \"wouldn't know a principle if it were handed to him on a silver plate.  He's been in Congress for twenty years, and no one can believe <i>anything</i> after they've been in Congress for twenty years.\"  But Will argues that, from his point of view, Ford's instincts \"are basically right.\"  He ticks off a list of Ford's accomplishments:  \"He has identified the principal long-term American problem, which is living off the seed corn of the future, that is, government confiscating for political purposes more than is consistent with the continued production of wealth.  He has retained as his two closest advisers on the most important issue, which is the economy, two men of proper vision--Greenspan and Simon.  He has tried, within the limits imposed by his very limited rhetorical gifts, to dramatize the issue.  And he has proposed a program, which although faultable, is a program nonetheless--the ceiling on spending and the tax cut.\"</span></p> <p><span>Will has written a number of columns about one of his favorite subjects, New York City, calling it a \"fiscal drunk\" that \"will reform only under the lash of necessity\" and arguing that it is \"a little welfare state, and that is why it is a shambles, and a welfare case.\"  He still opposes aid to the city, and has consistently praised Ford for his position against it, at least until Ford reversed himself in November.  \"I think bankruptcy would have been better,\" he says.  \"And I own some New York bonds, so I have an interest in saving them.\"  He is highly critical of the city government.  \"What ails New York is not what they say ails New York.  It's not that they're too generous to the poor--they're too generous to the wealthy.  In the wealthy, I include a New York City garbageman, who makes a lot more than the average American makes.\"</span></p> <p><span>He says that Governor Nelson Rockefeller and Mayors John Lindsay and Abraham Beame should be indicted:  \"They've misrepresented securities they were selling, fraudulently misrepresented the economic condition of the city, they've cooked the books.  They've done all kinds of things for which people get prosecuted--for which the directors of the Franklin National Bank <i>are</i> being prosecuted.\"  In short, he says, the city government is a \"corrupt, criminal operation.\"</span></p> <p><span>Despite these harsh words, Will opposes increasing taxes in New York City, which he thinks will drive out businesses and middle-class families, further narrowing the city's tax base.  New York, he says, \"has to go through a fever.  They have to start charging tuition at the City University; they have to remove rent control; and they have to renegotiate the pensions.  And they ought to close ten or so city hospitals.  They ought to reduce the size of the police force--all kinds of things.\"  But Ford's acceptance of a $2.3 billion loan guarantee bill will make such reforms unlikely, if not impossible:  \"The federal government, by aiding them, has accepted the thesis that default is unthinkable.  That's giving New York a license to steal, because they can always say, 'Well, I'm going to default.'\"</span></p> <p><span>If Will has mixed views about Ford's handling of domestic issues, he is often scathingly critical of his foreign policy.  After Ford refused to meet with Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn last summer, Will suggested that \"perhaps Brezhnev, in the spirit of detente, would refrain from seeing people offensive to the U.S. government's moral sensibilities--if it had any.\"  He thinks Ford should fire Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger '50, calling detente \"a policy in search of a rationale.  The original policy was 'we'll have detente so we can get agreements', and it has slowly become 'we need agreements to preserve detente.'\"</span></p> <p><span>More important to Will are the moral issues raised by Kissinger's policy.  \"I think that the United States--under detente, as practiced by Dr. Kissinger--has been almost proudly indifferent to questions of human rights.  And I think that's bad for this country--I don't think you need to be sentimental or particularly idealistic.  It is in this nation's <i>interest</i> to pressure the Soviet Union and isolate it as a tyranny.\"  Will admits that he doesn't know how successful such a policy might be, but insists that the Soviet Union \"ought to be offered unpleasant choices.  We have not offered it unpleasant choices.  If they want all that grain, if they want to raise the protein consumption of their people, they're going to have to treat their people differently.  They may say, 'well, to hell with it, we don't want to raise the protein consumption of our people.'  Well, that's just fine.  We ought to make it very hard for them, in dealing with their own people, to maintain the kind of military machine they maintain.\"  As for nuclear strategy, Will argues that the SALT agreement \"was not in our national interest.  I think it was wrong to negotiate away defensive missiles.  It committed us to a general nuclear strategy that is dangerous and not moral.\"  He says the basis of any strategy that does not include defensive missiles \"is to hold civilians hostage in undefended cities.\"</span></p> <p><span>Will is similarly hostile to the Chinese government.  Asked which of its policies he objects to, he says flatly, \"All of them.  I mean that quite seriously.  It's certainly killed far more than its fair share of people in this century.  There's no freedom to speak of in China.\"  But he isn't optimistic about the prospects of forcing the Chinese government to change its policies:  \"When I say we have a moral obligation, I understand that a government, meaning ours, that can't really deliver the mail, has a very limited ability to change the world beyond our borders.  I do think that it's a negative obligation, that we shouldn't make life any easier for tyrannical governments.\"</span></p> <p><span>Like many conservatives, Will is scornful of the United Nations, and argues that it should be dissolved.  \"It's founded on a contradiction,\" he says.  \"A legislative chamber assumes a certain minimal consensus about values and aims.  There are none between members of the UN.  There is a majority of police states, and a minority of democracies.\"  He thinks the UN's days are numbered.  Asked how soon he expects it to disappear, he smiles tightly.  \"Not soon enough.  But it will.  The UN would fold tomorrow if we didn't pay almost everyone's way there.  Those preposterous, squalid little nations who make it up believe in the UN, but not to the point of actually paying for it, God knows.\"  Will has little but praise for the present American ambassador to the UN, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, professor of Government, and thinks he would be a much better Secretary of State than Kissinger.</span></p> <p><span>Anyone who is both critical of Ford and indisputably conservative might be expected to feel a great deal of sympathy with his chief Republican rival, Ronald Reagan, but that is not the case with Will.  He scoffs at the value of a Reagan challenge:  \"There's not a dime's worth of difference between them, really, in terms of what they believe.\"  Asked about his description of their differences as \"microscopic\", Will smiles sardonically again.  \"That's an assumption,\" he remarks.  \"I'm assuming there's a microscope that could show a difference.\"</span></p> <p><span>He is reluctant to predict who will win the nomination, but admits that if he had to bet, he would bet on Reagan--\"but I wouldn't bet much.\"  He gives Reagan the edge mainly because of the sort of people who vote in presidential primaries.  Reagan, Will says, \"is more fun, and basically politics at the nominating level is dominated by comfortable, middle-class, leisured people.  They do it for fun, not because they're being ground into the dust by the iron heel of tyranny.\"  Asked his own preference between Ford and Reagan, Will pauses as if he had never considered the question before.  \"I don't know,\" he finally replies.  \"I'm not that interested.  I suppose one of these days I'm going to have to get serious about this and face the fact that it's going to be one of those two.\"  He shakes his head.  \"Oh, I don't care.  I suppose Ford in a sense.  Maybe Reagan in a sense.  I don't know.\"</span></p> <p><span>In any case, Will doubts that it will make much difference who the GOP nominates, and predicts a fairly easy Democratic victory.  \"This is the ultimate challenge to the Democratic party.  If they can kick this one away, they have really raised it to an art form,\" he says, chuckling.  The depleted numbers of the Republican Party and the poor health of the economy, he thinks, will make it almost impossible for any Republican to be elected President next year.</span></p> <p><span>But Will's pessimism goes far beyond the Republican Party's prospects in the '76 elections.  He broods gloomily over the future of American society and of the world itself.  \"I think the most depressing and, in the long run, alarming, tendency in the world today is the mindless attack on what is called elitism,\" he says.  \"It's an attack on quality and excellence.  The levelling attack on excellence is the threat to what I value, which is a sort of reasonableness and quality--in everything.  There are a lot of forces loose in the world against quality, in favor of uniformity--which is always a lowering of quality.\"</span></p> <p><span>The problem, in Will's view, goes beyond even that trend.  For all his insistence on calling himself a conservative in the Burkean tradition, Will is strongly attached to the values of 18th and 19th century liberalism, with its emphasis on individual freedom, decentralized and limited government, and economic laissez-faire.  He is not preoccupied by the traditional conservative ideals, order and tradition.  He shows little concern for the decline of religion or the undermining of authority, unlike more traditional conservatives like those at National Review.</span></p> <p><span>Will is frank about the reasons for his general pessimism:  \"We've only had liberal, bourgeois civilization for about 200 years.  That's not very long--it's a mere blink.  No reason it will last forever.  If you look at the depressing sweep of human history, I see no reason to believe that free societies, which took so long to come around and are so rare today--and indeed, are fewer today than they were ten years ago--I see no reason to believe that they're the wave of the future.  They're certainly not the wave of the past.\"</span></p> <p><span>Will has not completely given up to despair but he sees little chance of reversing the decay of the liberal, bourgeois civilization he cherishes.  \"The question,\" he says, \"is how is it possible to have a quickened sense of anxiety, in the public at large, about the growing power of the state, the growing ugliness of life, and the general undisciplined nature of public and private appetites.\"  He shakes his head.  \"And I'm not very hopeful about that.\"</span></p>"}

{"title": "Carter's Trilateral Connection | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Mondale, Vance, Brzezinski, Brown, Blumenthal--these men represent the entire Cabinet-level foreign policy wing of the new Administration.  These men, along with Jimmy Carter himself and most of his old foreign policy and economic advisers, are among the 60 original American members of a private international group known as the Trilateral Commission.  Many of the policies that these commission members have formulated together over the last few years may become reality now that they have assumed power.</span></p> <p><span>The Trilateral Commission, founded in 1973 by David Rockefeller '36, seeks to encourage cooperation between three great industrial regions of the world--North America, Western Europe, and Japan.  A stated intent of the Trilateral is to mix legitimizing intellectual talent, like Columbia professors Zbigniew Brzezinski and Richard N. Gardner '48, with an array of public and private citizens influential enough to see the commission's ideas through to fruition.</span></p> <p><span>In its news bulletin, <i>Trialogue</i>, the Trilateral Commission characterizes its policies towards international relations as the \"reformist approach.\"  It believes that \"expansion of the global economic pie, rather than (its) redistribution, is the most hopeful means of improving the relative economic positions of the poorer nations.\"</span></p> <p><span>How much influence has the commission has with Carter?  Gerald Rafshoon, his media specialist, has said that Carter's selection to the commission \"was one of the most fortunate accidents of the early campaign and critical to his building support where it counted.\"</span></p> <p><span>Edwin O. Reischauer, University Professor, recalls Carter as an enthusiastic commission member who not only attended all of the regular biannual meetings, which lasted four to five days each, but also sat in at the executive committee sessions--the group that decided what policies the commission would advocate.</span></p> <p><span>\"I imagine it was Carter who pushed to join the Trilateral rather than vice-versa,\" Reischauer said recently.  \"He impressed me as someone who was intelligently trying to go about educating himself on foreign policy.  He then got to know people with common interests.\"</span></p> <p><span>Carter has publicly acknowledged that his basic foreign policy education was provided by the commission.  It is no surprise then that Gardner, Professor Richard N. Cooper of Yale (who is also director of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund), Henry D. Owens of the Brookings Institute, and commission director Brzezinski were Carter's top foreign policy and economic advisers over the last three years.</span></p> <p><span>Carter's first appointment to the new administration was fellow member Cyrus R. Vance to succeed Henry A. Kissinger '50 as Secretary of State.  Vance was Deputy Secretary of Defense under Robert S. McNamara and defended the escalation of bombing in Vietnam.  Vance, in turn, has appointed three other commission member as his chief deputies--Cooper, corporate lawyer Warren Christopher, and Lucy Wilson Benson, former president of the League of Women Voters and a director of the military-research-oriented Mitre Corporation, which does military research and development.</span></p> <p><span>Carter has nominated Harold Brown, president of the California Institute of Technology, to be his Secretary of Defense.  At a recent press conference, Brown denied his advocacy of increased bombing over Hanoi and Haiphong while Secretary of the Air Force in 1968, and stated that it was only one of several alternative proposals he had put forward.  He failed to mention that his other two proposals also called for increased bombing of Indochina.  The Pentagon Papers also reveal Brown did in fact advocate the first plan and that a year before this he had played the major role in dissuading McNamara from limiting the bombing of North Vietnam.</span></p> <p><span>Brown was also the main proponent of the jinxed F-111 bomber, a plane that even the Republican National Committee labelled as \"unacceptable.\"  He testified that it was \"proving to be an outstanding aircraft,\" while failing to mention that three of the six original prototypes had recently crashed.  Brown also pushed immediate deployment of the ABM and MIRV defense systems while others called for arms control.  Thus, Brown's expected support of the B-1 should be viewed with some skepticism.</span></p> <p><span>As his National Security Adviser, Carter chose Brzezinski, a former State Department member who is vociferous in his defense of \"limited wars\" like the Vietnam War.</span></p> <p><span>In the National Security Council, Brzezinski will work closely with Trilateral members W. Michael Blumenthal, nominated as the new Secretary of the Treasury, and Vice President-elect Walter F. Mondale.</span></p> <p><span>The Trilateral Commission itself is composed mainly of the heads of multinational corporations, corporate lawyers, politicians and academics, and is quite concerned with threats to the continued stability of the international economic system.  In fact, commission co-founder and director Brezinski sees this as the major problem facing contemporary American foreign policy.  In an article in Foreign Affairs coincident with the creation of the commission, he explains the foundations of his analysis:</span></p> <p><span>\"The U.S. is now the leading international investor with returns on these investments representing for some major U.S. enterprises the critical source of their margins of profits ... overtone of old fashioned isolationism, nonetheless, do make themselves heard, most notably within American labor concerned with the export of American jobs abroad.\"</span></p> <p><span>Thus labor may form a major source of opposition to Trilateral policies.  But Brzezinski maintains that the American economy has become so dependent on foreign resources that \"the concept of isolationism is at worst a suicidal policy and at best an irrelevance.\"</span></p> <p><span>Another important member of the commission is J. Paul Austin, chairman of the Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Company and of the Rand Corporation, and director of the Adela Investment Company of South Africa.  Austin originally sponsored Carter in the Trilateral and later served as his campaign finance chairman.  Still another Carter campaign confidante was Richard Holbrooke, managing editor of Foreign Policy and the president-elect's choice as the new ambassador to Italy.</span></p> <p><span>It is expected that Carter's administration will give serious consideration to the proposals published in the Trilateral Commission's \"Triangle Papers.\"  These papers are a series of policy statements aimed at critical issues facing the world economy.  The subject of each is decided by the executive committee of the Trilateral Commission and then actually researched and written by various American, European and Japanese academics, some of whom have served as Carter advisers.</span></p> <p><span>In a paper published last summer, the commission called for the reform of international economic institutions, saying it was time to \"think in terms of managing a single world economy.\"  But it is unlikely that the heavily business-oriented commission would actually advocate policies beneficial to the developing nations.</span></p> <p><span>New institutions need to be created, the report states, to prevent countries from nationalizing foreign investments (as many Third World states did unto American multinationals) and to govern other multinational corporations.  They cite as a growing problem the \"global scope of operations of multinational firms, exceeding the jurisdictions of any individual government.\"</span></p> <p><span>The Trilateral proposes rules to allocate the taxable income of multinational corporations among the nations they operate in, define antitrust policy and deal with improper corporate payments.  But these proposed restraints on multinationals are not for purely idealistic reasons nor just to make sure Third World nations are dealt with fairly.  The paper notes that \"one set of countries\" is losing jobs, exports, capital and technology to other nations which offer a particularly favorable climate for investment--such as Egypt, with its cheap labor and tax breaks.  \"Thus an increasing share of world production is being negotiated between the government of host countries and the management of multinational enterprises, who properly represent their own interests rather than the interests of their home countries,\" the commission position says.</span></p> <p><span>Under Trilateral guidelines, Third World countries would not be allowed to lure big Western firms away from their home base, thus avoiding what the commission vaguely terms as \"retaliatory actions.\"  Some members have suggested that these international rules might also help repair the damaged reputation of the multinationals.</span></p> <p><span>The Triangle Paper on the problem of international consultations argues for improved consultative procedures through which governments would face difficult issues early, informally and without drama.  This would \"lessen the shock of sudden action and minimize embarrassment to a friendly state.\"</span></p> <p><span>The eighth Trilateral position paper appeared as a book titled \"The Crisis of Democracy.\"  According to Brzezinski, it rethinks the \"central purposes\" of democratic government since \"the vitality of our political systems is a central precondition for the shaping of a stable international order.\"  Samuel P. Huntington, Thompson Professor of Government, who served as a Carter adviser and is playing a key role in the transition to power, wrote the section on the United States.  During the Vietnam War, Huntington wrote a Foreign Policy article explaining that forced urbanization of that country by U.S. bombing would gradually bring the hostilities to an end, a policy subsequently adopted by the Defense Department.</span></p> <p><span>As a policy-maker for the Trilateral Commission, Huntington warns, that democracy \"may only work when there is a relatively constant increase in the economic well-being of society.\"  He warns that \"there are potentially desirable limits to the indefinite expansion of political democracy.  Finally,\" he continues, \"a government which lacks authority and which is committed to substantial domestic programs will have little ability to impose on its people the sacrifices which may be necessary to deal with foreign policy problems and defense.\"</span></p> <p><span>Huntington attributes this decline in the \"governability of democracy\" to a \"stratum of value-oriented intellectuals who often devote themselves to the derogation of leadership, the challenging of authority, and the delegitimation of established institutions.\"  Huntington concludes that in an age of widespread education and pervasive mass media, this \"challenge to democratic government is, potentially at least, as serious as those posed in the past by aristocratic cliques, fascist movements, and Communist parties.\"</span></p> <p><span>To prevent an impotent government incapable of following \"internationalist economic policies,\" Huntington's paper suggests that the government \"assure its ability to withhold information at the source.\"  He predicts that the U.S. government may find it necessary to \"regulate\" the national news media with laws similar to the Sherman Antitrust Act.</span></p> <p><span>Huntington's opinions drew heavy criticism from some members of the commission, Reischauer said recently, but it was still published as a Triangle Paper.</span></p> <p><span>Soon after the global financial havoc wrought by soaring oil, food and fertilizer prices, the Trilateral issued a paper calling for a turning point in world economic relations to prevent the financial collapse of the Third World.  The Trilateral advocated that Oil Producing and Exporting Countries (OPEC) double its current foreign aid contribution of $3 billion and channel it through the World Bank.  Trilateral nations would then supply a 3 per cent interest subsidy and guarantee loans made to developing countries.  The advantage of this plan for the Trilateral nations is that the World Bank, which they control, would not be eclipsed by OPEC institutions which could represent an independent source of financing for countries which were hostile to the Trilateral bloc.</span></p> <p><span>In his Triangle Paper, Huntington outlined how a contemporary presidential candidate must put together a winning electoral coalition.  But \"once he is in power,\" Huntington writes, the electoral coalition has served its purpose.  What counts then is his ability to mobilize support from the key leaders of society and government.  \"The governing coalition need have little relation to the electoral coalition.\"</span></p> <p><span>Although he won the election as an outsider to the Amtrak corridor that runs from Falls Church to Cambridge, when it came time for Carter to replace the electoral coalition with the governing coalition he brought into his Cabinet representatives of the established institutions of American society and government.  Let us hope that he is not so over-whelmed by his own governing coalition that he forgets about the common people who elected him.</span></p> <p><span><i>This article was prepared with the valuable assistance of Jake Herms, a graduate student in Chemistry at M.I.T.</i></span></p>"}
{"title": "WOODWARD AVENUE | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>Between Pontiac and Detroit runs Michigan Highway No.1, Woodward Avenue, four lanes in each direction, a fitting testament to these cities and the industry that built and sustains them.  Until the late 1960s Woodward acted not only as the principal thoroughfare between the nation's fifth largest city and Pontiac, but also as one last cement haven for the amateur drag racers who did at times barrel down the wide park way at speeds exceeding one hundred miles an hour.  Today, staggered traffic lights and radar-equipped patrol cars have quashed what was once a standard form of recreation for many Michigan youths.  At the tame speed limit of 50, the expanse of Woodward is now a half-hour drive, past Kentucky Fried Chicken and bullet proof liquor stores, closed automobile factories, the now-deserted Motown records building, Cass Corridor--one of the nation's most crime-infested districts--several middle-class neighborhoods, and Bloomfield Hills, the nation's wealthiest per capita suburb.  On a typical ride down Woodward the motorist is not likely to see buses; public transportation has never been a popular cause in the Motor City.</b></span></p> <p><span>To the west from the head of Woodward Avenue the recently completed Pontiac Stadium, which can seat Pontiac's entire population, looms on the horizon.  Built by William Ford, brother of Henry Ford II, the stadium holds the 95,000 Lions fans who come each fall weekend to watch the Ford-owned team play.  Twenty-five miles to the south, at the foot of Woodward in downtown Detroit, is the partially completed Detroit Renaissance Center, a 70-story hotel surrounded by four 40-story office buildings, undertaken by Henry Ford II himself in the hopes of bringing commerce and the upper classes back into the declining city.</span></p> <p><span>Near the intersection of Woodward and Six Mile Road, a barbed wire fence protects one of the city's closed automobile plants.  Sex shops, pornographic movie theaters and topless bars flourish throughout the surrounding area.  During the day many of the workers who have lost their jobs since the industry reached its peak three years ago visit these places.  Industry-wide auto sales rose 48 per cent last year, but unemployment in Detroit and Pontiac remains at over 20 per cent.  Average unemployment in the two cities throughout 1974 hovered at around 30 percent.  The percentage of unemployment for those under age 22 is considerably higher; half, perhaps more than half of them are out of school or out on the streets.</span></p> <p><span>The only statistic which has risen consistently through boom and bust in the Detroit area is crime.  Over 113,000 felonies were reported in Detroit city last year, a solid 12 per cent increase over the 1974 figures.  The murder rate decreased, but remained the second highest per capita of all large U.S. cities.  Estimated trade in heroin, the nation's highest per capita, has leveled off at about $300,000,000 for approximately 30,000 addicts.</span></p> <p><span>During an economic slump crime is one of the few means of maintaining a decent standard of living--whether that crime is petty theft or the more glamorous domains of the pimp and the dealer.  Dealing starts in high school or earlier.  Some students can afford cars before they are old enough to obtain driver's licenses.  The game has its risks, but excitement adds to the glamour.  Some win; 17 and 18 years olds can be seen confidently wheeling Fleetwood Cadillacs and Lincoln Continentals through the city streets.  Some lose; an acquaintance of one of the authors was murdered in a \"drug-related crime\" within half a year of graduation from high school.</span></p> <p><span>While the speeds on Woodward have decreased, the number of teenagers who parade their cars up and down the road has not.  Supersized mag wheels on the back axle make the cars look as if they are always pointed downhill, and garter belts hang from rear-view mirrors as a sign of sexual conquest.  Owning and maintaining a car at an early age is a special status symbol around Detroit.  It provides exitement and an identity for students whose careers are already a thing of the past when they enter high school.</span></p> <p><span>Educators have tried to explain why in Detroit even students in the elementary schools seem unwilling to learn.  Perhaps both students and teachers know that in most cases education is not a path leading to the executive suite, but a way of biding one's time before going to work on the assembly line.  The number of fourth grade students who score significantly below the national average on standardized tests is almost ten times the number of students whose scores exceed the national average.  Educators complain about a lack of money for proper facilties.  Under the current system of property tax finance for public schools, it is especially difficult to obtain decent funds for education in a city where extensive citizen and industry migration to the suburbs has left many buildings only partially occupied or entirely deserted.  Furthermore, public schools in the last decade have lost $2 million in property tax revenues because of the conversion of $150 million worth or private property to make room for 23 miles of freeway from Detroit to its suburbs.  (Not a single highway entering Detroit has a toll-both on it.)</span></p> <p><span>Half-way between Detroit and Pontiac it is a different story.  Just off Woodward at Fifteen Mile Road in Bloomfield Hills--the home of those who have made it in the automobile and related industries--is the Cranbrook School.  At Cranbrook a classroom may have no more than ten students in it.  Most of the teachers could hold university positions.  Cranbrook is the midwest's answer to Andover and Exeter.  Here a platoon of gardeners work on the acres of forest and expenses of green lawn.  Most of the entrances are patrolled by security guards.  Dotting the landscape are small ponds and lakes, athletic facilities which include a domed tennis building with more than 25 courts, a hockey rink, polo field and colliseum-like football field.  One of the small groves hides a Greek amphitheater.  Beautiful pieces of sculpture rest undisturbed on the lawns.  The buildings are low and beautiful, with copper roofs and leaded windows.</span></p> <p><span>The grounds are surrounded by a meandering stream and the homes of the affluent and there is nothing in the area that can be compared with it.  And each year a few promising students from poor neighborhoods in Detroit are given scholarships to attend, so that perhaps some day they can live in the homes that one sees from the ampitheater.</span></p> <p><span>A peaceful and prosperous Detroit has long been the dream of those business titans who built the city and the surrounding area.  Henry Ford II's Renaissance Center, the most recent attempt to rebuild Detroit, is not the first optimistic gesture of its kind.  In 1941 Henry Ford II's father offered an unprecendented five dollar a day wage to his workers and vowed he would make Detroit the great American city.  Within two years, the worst race riot in America's history up to that time had destroyed Ford's hopes of industrial serenity.  Ten years ago, at the start of the mid-1960s business boom, a feature in Fortune magazine on \"The New Detroit\" proclaimed, \"A new consensus is abroad in the city.  All the diverse elements that make up Detroit's power structure, once divided and pitted against itself, are being welded together in a remarkable synthesis...most significant is the progress Detroit has made in race relations.\"  Less than two years later, in the summer of 1967, America's most violent race riot racked the city, leaving 43 dead and destroying almost $50 million worth of property.</span></p> <p><span>After the riot the Detroit Police Department formed STRESS, a corps of specially-trained undercover units, to control crime in the city.  The program was discontinued after undercover action resulted in the deaths of at least two minors and a police officer who was playing cards at the time.  In Detroit the name policeman is rarely used for law enforcement officials.  They are usually called \"pigs\" or \"fucks.\"</span></p> <p><span>Nowhere do the vicissitudes of the nation's business cycle show more starkly than in the Motor City and its environs.  In times of economic hardship, unemployment and crime skyrocket; in times of prosperity, workers of different races and backgrounds, thrown together on assembly lines in a one-industry region, vent their frustrations in racial hatred and violence.</span></p> <p><span>Across the Detroit River from the foot of Woodward Avenue you can see Windsor, Ontario, a city with close to 250,000 people.  Windsor, a medium-sized processing and industrial center, is the quiet gateway to Ontario's southern farmlands.  Windsor is hardly a hub cap's throw away from the soon to be completed Detroit Renaissance Center.  From the top of the Center's 70-story tower the men who built Detroit and their successors will have a bird's eye view of their city and the city across the river, and then maybe will be able to see why in 1974 there were only 25 murders in Windsor, and 801 in the Motor City.</span></p>"}
{"title": "End U.S. Interference in Angola | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>HE FORD administration's insistence on continuing military and diplomatic intervention in Angola despite Senate opposition represents a deplorable refusal to submit foreign policy to properly informed public opinion.  The covert character of early U.S. aid in Angola was a deliberate effort to present the American public with a <i>fait accompli.</i>  Although American intervention has now been made public, Ford and Kissinger continue to repudiate any notion of democratic participation in foreign policy decision making by their use of discretionary funds to aid anti-MPLA factions.  The House should reaffirm the Senate's opposition to such aid in its upcoming session, and Congress should take severe measures to prevent American interference in Angola.  Such steps would be a key move toward recapturing control over foreign policy from administrators not responsible to the American public.</span></p> <p><span>Kissinger's justification for intervention in Angola rests on a series of lies.  He claims the United States is not opposed to an MPLA regime in Angola, but only to a Soviet satellite which he says would endanger American strategic interests and prevent the Angolan people from determining their own government.  In fact, escalated aid to MPLA from the Soviet Union came as a response to massive American and NATO military aid to FNLA/UNITA, filtered since last spring through Zaire.  The result of American aid has been only to increase MPLA's dependence on the Soviet Union.  But the MPLA is by no means a Soviet puppet, and its leader, Agostinho Neto, has explicitly declared his opposition to a Soviet base in Angola.</span></p> <p><span>American calls for a withdrawal of all Soviet aid to MPLA are thus hypocritical, since it was American aid that originally precipitated major foreign intervention.  Furthermore, American intervention legitimates the South African invasion of Angola, which poses a still more serious threat to Angolan self-determination.  Calls for non-intervention ignore the reality of the situation--which has already been modified by foreign aid to Angolan factions--and the impact of Western financial aid which is not likely to cease with a non-intervention pact.  South Africa--the major threat to Angolan sovereignty--has already shown a flagrant disregard for international agreements in its refusal to relinquish its U.N. trusteeship of Namibia.  U.S. aid to Angolan factions has been CIA-controlled, and thus is no more likely than South African interference to cease as a result of an international agreement.</span></p> <p><span>Ford and Kissinger's attempts to force African nations to vote against recognition of the MPLA at this week's meeting of the Organization for African Unity exposes the self-serving nature of American aid to Third World countries.  African resistance to the U.S. administration's threats to withdraw humanitarian and financial aid from MPLA supporters shows the isolation resulting from high-handed American diplomatic coercion.  American foreign policy in the Third World must be reoriented toward a recognition of these countries' sovereignty and from attempts at domination.  The United States can no longer play the role of a global policeman to protect its strategic and economic interests.  Accordingly, the U.S. must renounce its offensive against the MPLA, whose support among the Angolan people would bring it victory in the real absence of foreign intervention.</span></p>"}
{"title": "The Old Negotiator Comes Home | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The last time William H. Lazonick, assistant professor of Economics, ran into John T. Dunlop, Lamonst University Professor, was four uears ago this spring at an evening seminar on the structure of American society.</span></p> <p><span>Dunlop was then dean of the Faculty, and that night he gave a seminar whose subject Lazonick recalls as the greatness of the labor movement and the importance of collective bargaining.</span></p> <p><span>Lazonick was then a graduate student in Economics involved in the effort by nearly half of the 2800 grad students to form a union, and the irony of Dunlop's message that night was that the dean was at the same time firmly resisting the demand by students for a collective bargaining agent.</span></p> <p><span>\"I remember I listened with enjoyment while there was a great deal of baiting of John by students--but that's always the case when it's a colleague and not myself,\" says professor emeritus John Kenneth Galbraith, who sponsored the series of seminars.</span></p> <p><span>Dunlop did not think his position on collective bargaining contradicted itself, John B. Fox Jr. '59, assistant dean of the Faculty for academic administration, recalls.  \"He had a clear order in his own mind on that subject.\"</span></p> <p><span>The students wanted a union to press their demands on financial issues, but Dunlop argued that student scholarships could not be regarded as a form of compensation, and that, as he said in an April 1972 Faculty meeting, \"resort to a strike and picket line rather than reasoned discussion were not congenial to the academic community.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"The idea of exclusive representation, which was central to collective bargaining by blue collar workers and which would preclude any individual from reaching a particular settlement of his own problems except through an exclusive bargaining representative, did not seem to the Dean to be appropriate in an academic setting,\" the minutes of that meeting report.</span></p> <p><span>Edward T. Wilcox, now director of General Education and a former dean of the grad school, says, \"My interpretation of his feelings then were that he felt that there was a lot of amateurism in what they were doing.  He was quick to speak and spoke at the beginning.\"</span></p> <p><span>For all of Dunlop's bluntness and the leading position he took in making sure the union never got off the ground, his line was a conciliatory one.</span></p> <p><span>Dunlop is a very \"pragmatic\" man, Richard B. Freeman, professor of Economics, says:  \"He's like a marriage counselor--well, is a marriage counselor liberal, conservative or what?\"</span></p> <p><span>In the spring of 1972, the marriage counselor proposed to the graduate students that they form a joint committee with administrators--a joint committee that, in the words of the Faculty's secretary, would \"address itself to the multiple interests within a varied and large academic community.\"</span></p> <p><span>The proposal never actually <i>happened,</i> but the story is indicative of the way Dunlop works.  Verna Johnson, the durable administrative assitant to the dean of the Faculty, calls him a \"mediator\":  \"He would seek ways of getting at a solution by talking at great length, endlessly.  I think he worked best sitting down and talking with people.  And I'm sure he could outlast most people.\"</span></p> <p><span>The venerable Galbraith says he gained respect for Dunlop by opposing him consistently in departmental matters within the Economics Department.  \"My experience has almost universally been losing,\" Galbraith says.  \"I've been impressed because he's such an artistic operator.\"  Dunlop, he adds, always worked with the interests of the department in mind.</span></p> <p><span>Wilcox compares Dunlop with an \"old-school labor negotiator, a rough-necked shop foreman.\"  He says of Dunlop's three-year deanship, \"He was carrying all the balls--and I guess I mean that two ways--in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and still going down to Washington each week.\"</span></p> <p><span>Dunlop's latest flirtation with the more important world in Washington ended this week, when he decided that the old standby, recourse to discussion, was no longer available to mend the gaping hole that President Ford had left in the web of labor-management cooperation that Dunlop labored to create.</span></p> <p><span>Ford had vetoed a bill to extend the rights of strikers that he had earlier promised Dunlop he would pass.  Dunlop's head was on the line:  he had worked hard to get Ford's acceptance of the legislation, then had conveyed the president's assurance back to labor leaders.</span></p> <p><span>So Dunlop resigned Tuesday, saying that the possibility for progress in the construction industry with him as secretary of Labor no longer existed.</span></p> <p><span>The statement he released was long and overly-worded.  There was one gentle stab in Ford's direction, but for the most part it was just a mealy-mouthed and conciliatory swan-song from a man who will undoubtedly return to Washington after he comes back to Harvard to perform some work, perhaps as a labor arbitrator.</span></p> <p><span>As Lazonick says, \"Dunlop's sort of one of the people who provides the link, one of the conciliators, between labor and management.  Labor is kind of conservative, and the capitalists want to keep it that way.  He's sort of the go-between, and he wants to keep that position.\"</span></p> <p><span>Under Ford's veto, Dunlop lost that position, and he will come back, to work mainly at the Business School, in early February.</span></p> <p><span>\"He's pragmatic--that's what you call a man like him\" Stephen Marglin '59, professor of Economics, said yesterday.  \"He's opportunistic, if you want to make it a pejorative characterization.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "Spring Training for Presidents | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>R</b>ECENT PRESIDENTS have talked as if governing the country were a sport.  Maybe it is.  But how do the candidates rate on the field?</span></p> <p><span>With major league spring training and the opening of the Presidential circuit soon to be upon us, here's my 'book' on the season's most promising teams and players.</span></p> <p><span><i>THE DEMOCRATS</i></span></p> <p><span>This year playing out of New York City.  Season begins February 24 in New Hampshire.  In alphabetical order:</span></p> <p><span>JIMMY (\"Nuts\") CARTER, 1st b. rookie:  Earned his nickname from habit of chewing peanuts instead of tobacco; smiles a lot; last year MVP in the Georgia circuit as well as the league's only player.</span></p> <p><span>BIRCH (\"Tree\") BAYH, c.f. rookie:  Good fielder, covers a lot of ground, in fact seems to prefer everyone else's position to his own; has tried to organize a player's union which critics insist will be part of the AFL/CIO.</span></p> <p><span>FRED (\"Everyman\") HARRIS, l.f. rookie:  Just up from the triple-A Grass Roots League; fellow players joke that even away from the ball park, he's \"out in left field;\" has gotten into numerous disputes this spring over desire to throw fly balls into the stands; claims he does it to help \"the little man.\"</span></p> <p><span>HENRY (\"Scoop\") JACKSON, r.f. rookie:  Eoisterous singles hitter; major fielding weakness is his fondness for right field line--he doesn't like to leave it except between innings.</span></p> <p><span>HUBERT (\"Horatio\") HUMPHREY a.k.a. HHH, pinch-hitting veteran:  The 'old man' of the club; in his fourth major league season; long ball threat although has never come through in the clutch; once on bases loves to run, although his legs went three seasons ago; once described as \"deceptively slow;\" could appear in the line-up at any time.</span></p> <p><span>MILTON (\"Gov.\") SHAPP, 3rd b. rookie:  Unknown quantity; some say his promotion from the minors was a clerical error, others claim he wandered onto the field one day and no one has had the heart to tell him the Little League game was cancelled.</span></p> <p><span>SARGENT (\"Kennedy\") SHRIVER, 2nd b. rookie:  Given position by wife's family after she complained he was hanging around the house; has stirred up antagonisms by encouraging his teammates to join the Peace Corps.</span></p> <p><span>MORRIS (\"Mo\") UDALL, ss. rookie:  So far no hit, no field; you have to wonder how he made it to the big time; travels to away games by horse-drawn carriage.</span></p> <p><span>GEORGE (\"Pointy Head\") WALLACE p. veteran:  Possessor of a fine hard one but would rather throw it at batters' heads than over the plate; has a reputation for great springs but loses form in the move up north--still, this could always be the year.</span></p> <p><span><i>SIDELINED</i></span></p> <p><span>EDWARD (\"Teddy\") KENNEDY, veteran:  Plagued by his Chappaquidick knee, is said to be undergoing corrective operations on his conscience.</span></p> <p><span>GEORGE (\"End the War\") McGOVERN, veteran:  Has never recovered from the backlash of his $1000 a day salary demand of last season.</span></p> <p><span><i>TEAM STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES</i></span></p> <p><span>A young team, perhaps too young.  Desperately needs a strong leader or manager.  The club's inexperience has shown in some glaring ways this spring.  Bayh and Harris have knocked each other out chasing the same fly ball while Bayh and Jackson seem to think balls hit in between them possess cooties.  On potential double play balls in the infield, Udall often throws to third and the one time he did get it to second, Shriver, in a fit of pique, threw it back.  Finally, pitcher Wallace's predilection for putting members of the opposite team on base could hurt in post-season play.</span></p> <p><span><i>THE REPUBLICANS</i></span></p> <p><span>This year playing out of Washington--and California and Kansas City.  Season begins almost any day.</span></p> <p><span>GERALD (\"Gerry\") FORD, center rookie:  Only MVP never to have played in majors; when first broke in, had to be cured of habit of stopping line drives with his head; has just recently come to grips with other ways of using it.</span></p> <p><span>HENRY (\"Bismarck\") KISSINGER, p. veteran:  Claims to stand above league affiliations; even refuses to wear a uniform--but they couldn't win without him; out of the Harvard minor league system; confesses to being a loner, \"I just don't like people.\"</span></p> <p><span>RONALD (\"The Gipper\") REAGAN, r.f. rookie:  Turned heads at spring camp when suggested that violators of game's rules should be \"taken out and shot\"; also recommends drastically raising ticket prices to get rid of bleacher \"freeloaders\"; won't listen to advice on how to play hitters claiming that such would be an encroachment upon local rights.</span></p> <p><span><i>SIDELINED</i></span></p> <p><span>RICHARD (\"Tricky\") NIXON, veteran:  Banned from season play as a result of his placing bugs and other objects in Democrat's playing equipment; was found out when he taped himself to improve his fielding average; explained away unpopularity by citing the support of a 'silent majority', presumably TV fans.</span></p> <p><span>NELSON (\"Rocky Baby\") ROCKEFELLER, veteran.  Stated when promoted to club, \"I'm all for the team,\" only to discover team wasn't for him; was told five times to go play with somebody else; still technically on team but only calls the ball names, won't touch it with bat or glove; teammates call him their pet rock.</span></p> <p><span><i>TEAM STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES</i></span></p> <p><span>The numerical disadvantage may be deceiving; the club emulates softball showmen The King and his Court, with the important difference that no one knows who's king.  Like the Dems, this team needs a manager.  Player-manager Ford has been totally ignored by fans and players alike.  Scribes say he may soon be out of a job.  Maybe he could go back to football.  Reagan plays too far to the right for even a right fielder and Ford copies him, thus the famous Republican Shift.  Kissinger's hummer is no longer what it once was, and his refusal to let anyone else play the infield positions has hurt in the past.</span></p> <p><span>Overall, two weak teams; exactly what we say every spring of the Presidential season.  But maybe we've got it all wrong.  How does 'Fred Lynn for President' sound?</span></p>"}

{"title": "Plotting Your Horoscope | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Hanging over one of the higher window panes in Frank Fisher's office in the back of 54 Dunster Street is a small lead frame with the stained glass image of a carrot and stick superimposed upon a square Crimson H.  The office itself is a brown study of spartan furnshings and dusky bookishness.  The start Harvard armchairs, the large and brooding rug, the huge oak-slab desk spattered with papers, the shelves of volumes bound in lusterless red--all bear the bloodless mark of a collection that has had to depend for its light on a tiny ration of western sun that filters past the Institute of Politics and through the great window.  Finally, there is the long and severe form of Mr. Fisher himself, the broker of futures, who is much more the stick than the carrot.  For the ambitious student who happens to wander this way, the whole scene suggests, with a Protestant New England reserve, that, No, there is no earthly reward, or at least, To get a good job, you must work hard while you are here.</span></p> <p><span>Actually, Fisher's back room is far off the main stream of grade-grubbing and competition, and Fisher himself does not thrash any students on to professional reward back here.  Amid what David Riesman '31, Ford Professor of Social Science, calls the disturbing consequences the preprofessional scramble is having on Harvard College, back here in the very boiler room of student aspiration--the office of career services--Fisher excuses himself from the turnmoil.  He has not witnessed \"avarice,\" he says, and the term \"preprofessional scramble\" is just too imprecise.  Even the carrot and the stick, he says, are a gift of a friend to commemorate an article--on public policy.  Fisher's is the attitude that has prompted one House tutor to comment of the office of career service, \"What used to be a ruthless preprofessional machine is now the last haven of middle-aged hippiedom.\"</span></p> <p><span>If Frank Fisher's head is in the clouds, it is because he seems much less interested in the preprofessional student and his parcel of concerns than in the angst of the student who doesn't know what he is going to do.  The psychology of the mixed-up student's dilemma fascinates Fisher, who himself has flitted from one high-ranking administrative job to another in the white-collar constellation.  On the eve of limited adulthood, Fisher says, these perturbed children suffer because they must narrow down their fantasies about future occupation to concrete possibility.</span></p> <p><span>And when Fisher talks of the health of the College, his concern is not how effectively the school is getting students into professional schools.  He deals in much more lofty terms--how much conformity the place inflicts.  While others may be sweating or swearing about how Harvard is now a trade school, Fisher seems pleased about how the College has changed in the 30 years since he went here.</span></p> <p><span>Now, says Fisher, there is a wider divergence of backgrounds, hometowns, and parental incomes and as one consequence, there is a greater \"tolerance of differences,\" which is what seems to matter the most.  It is in such an atmosphere, Fisher says, that a student can build up the \"guts\" to do something independent or risky.</span></p> <p><span>I found someone with guts--I'll call him George McAlister '70--in an apartment house in Boston that looks like the flatiron building.  He did not want to talk over the telephone, and he did not want me to copy down his real name or the subject of the novel he is writing.  He is on unemployment, but admits that he is \"bourgeois\" or at least \"materialistic\":  the stereo was playing a Brandenburg concerto when I walked in, there was at least one plant hanging off the ceiling, and he began to talk--in the middle of a spotless and sunlit kitchen--after he had begun to drink the first of two glasses of hot cider.</span></p> <p><span>\"I could have been a very unhappy lawyer,\" he says.  As it is, he left college to work for a year behind a postage meter in the bottom of an office building, then for another year at a professional service aimed to help the underprivileged in Boston.  One of the reasons he enjoyed the first job so much is because it posed no threat to his future; it was only when he began the later, administrative employment, that it became \"a fair contest between that and my writing.\"</span></p> <p><span>He started writing last May.  Once before, he began a book, a children's book, but it went nowhere (\"Why didn't I finish it?  I know why--I'll give you a good Harvard Philosophy Department phenomenological answer--because I stopped writing.\"), and now, a person who at Harvard always wanted \"something to care about,\" he finds himself \"less desperate than I have been in a long time, finally able to do something I haven't been able to sit down and do before.\"</span></p> <p><span>He agrees with Fisher that it is easier to be different now.  There is a \"whole expectation\" that some will want to be artists, so it is \"easier now to decide to write.\"  He adds, \"I would have stood out more 40 years ago.\"  But the glib way Fisher describes the senior's dilemma hardly approaches the nightmarish depth of the experience for George McAlister.</span></p> <p><span>\"Harvard prepared me for the outside in my case by not shielding me from the terror that I would feel.  But Harvard itself didn't prepare me,\" he says.  \"If Harvard did anything for me it was to provide an atmosphere that was so uncomfortable that I had to face myself right at the beginning rather than postpone it.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"I know I'm still a Harvard man,\" he reassured me.  \"I always will be--it's stamped me.\"  And before he let me leave, he wanted to hear about me and my Harvard experience.</span></p> <p><span>Richard B. Freeman, professor of Economics, found five minutes and a seat for me in between phone calls in a large closet of an office cluttered with computer print-outs and color travel posters.  Freeman is much less orthodox-looking than either Fisher or George McAlister, in leather jacket, boots and jeans.  But hetalks much faster than either of them, does not look at you or pause to reflect, and does not shed any tears over the angst of senior year at Harvard College.  His pessimism is much more detached.  Americans are overeducated, he says, and although Harvard students always have been and will always be above the mean, they are not immune to the gnashings of a choked market.</span></p> <p><span>Freeman's economic analysis is more sophisticated than that of Fisher, who has great faith that students can read the market.  Freeman says the point law school became popular was a day in the late 60's when a top Wall Street firm raised its salaries $5000 across the board.  What is next in sudden popularity?  Here, he answers, grabbing across his desk at the loose 300 pages of manuscript of his book on the overeducated, look at this beautiful graph.  The graph shows two roughly bell-shaped curves going up and down in parallel paths.  This, Freeman explains, is the employment prediction he made for the engineering field a few years ago, matched neatly by the actual trend in hiring.  He is proud of the correlation.  Business school is becoming the newest popular field, he says, with especially women viewing their prospects as favorable in what will, inevitably, provide yet another glut in this scarcity-ridden model.</span></p> <p><span>The bottom of the heap is the Howard Johnson floor.  Over and over in the harshly meritocratic scheme of David Riesman '31, the student who does not deserve to make it ends up on what Riesman figuratively labels \"the Howard Johnson floor.\"</span></p> <p><span>The students who might end up there are the 20 per cent of the Harvard class Riesman lumps together when he breaks the class down into three broad parts.  In group number three are the utterly mixed-up graduates, \"the people who fall into the abyss when they graduate.\"  Some of them, in grasping at straws, opt for the \"post-baccalaureate baccalaureate,\" a law degree, while others heedlessly try to make it in the demanding fields of scholarship or the creative arts.  \"This group does take off,\" he says, \"and often they have insufficient skills to stay off the Howard Johnson floor.  They're the ones who are driving cabs or working at check-out counters.\"</span></p> <p><span>Riesman has much more sympathy for the \"dazzlingly brilliant\" members of group number one who have opted for law or medical school instead of trying to make it in scholarship or art.  It's what he calls the \"who little me?  syndrome,\" where students think that by taking their aspirations down a peg, they are not being \"arrogant or hubristic.\"  He blames the trend in part on the \"anti-elitist, egalitarian wave of the 60's as it survives into the 70's.\"  Such students elect these careers, Riesman says, \"as if to say, \"I can't salve myself that I have an independent contribution to make to make to the world, as a scholar or an artist.'\"</span></p> <p><span>Other members of the group number one, he says, are going to law or medical school because they ought to go there, but for the rest it is a \"brain drain.\"</span></p> <p><span>The last group--number two, actually--is the smallest.  This is the charmed group that has the talent, intelligence and security to keep out of professional schools and off the Howard Johnson floor and make it in the sacred fields of art or academics.</span></p> <p><span>The important factor for these students is a certain security, he says, which is less economic than psychological.  \"Their curiosity and interest are stronger than the need for economic security, and, seemingly and often actually, [the need for] the answer to the question, 'What are you going to do?'\"  Riesman says.</span></p> <p><span>\"Much that I know has come from Frank Fisher,\" he adds.  Both agree that students should learn a skill--like international finance or pianotuning--to sustain their confidence and keep them solvent while they wait for their occupational ships to come in.</span></p> <p><span>Still, Riesman is not very happy with the state of Harvard College now, 50 years after he came here.  Some students should be going to professional schools, he says, but on the other end of the phone, I am sure, his head is shaking:  \"The world that you and your generation faces is a frightening one, and students behave anxiously.  They sometimes in that anxiety behave in a too lemming-like way.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "Jean Mayer:  You Are What You Eat | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Jean Mayer was standing in the Dudley House lunch line waiting for a grilled tuna fish and cheese sandwich.</span></p> <p><span>\"Are you really eating here?\"  a student asked him.  \"I thought you, at least, would have enough sense to stay away.\"</span></p> <p><span>Mayer laughed and moved down the line to carefully consider the choice of salads.  He picked up a plastic wrapped three-bean salad and then paused before the fruit.  \"Are you sure you won't have some fruit?\"  he asked his luncheon guest.  She shook her head.  \"Not even an apple?\"  he persisted.  He filled a glass with lemonade.</span></p> <p><span>A compactly built man with a French accent, Mayer radiates his special brand of charm even when he's ordering lunch.  While passing through the line he has managed to say something to all the food service employees, the cashier, and several students.  But he is not, by any means, an overbearing chatterbox.  A man of outstanding accomplishments.  Mayer is also exceptionally modest.  He would rather talk about his work as master of Dudley House than about his many achievements in the field of nutrition.</span></p> <p><span>Born in Paris in 1920, Mayer is the son of the famous French physiologist, Andre Mayer.  Father and son have had remarkably similar careers.  As students, both excelled in the humanities as well as the sciences.  Both were decorated during world wars.  Andre taught in a French medical school; Jean is a professor of nutrition, affiliated with the Harvard School of Public Health for 25 years.  While Andre was instrumental in forming and leading the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, Jean served on many U.N. nutrition committees and has advised Presidents Nixon and Ford on U.S. food policy.</span></p> <p><span>Mayer is uncertain how much his father influenced his career choice.  \"I was always very interested in physiology,\" said Mayer, who earned a Ph.D. in physiological chemistry from Yale and a doctor of science from the University of Paris.  \"I don't think I had that many conversations with my father about my future or science until I embarked on that career.\"</span></p> <p><span>Mayer could have easily followed his father and had a successful career in France, but he decided, after visiting the United States in 1939, that he would eventually make his home here.  This decision often put him in an awkard position when serving on General de Gaulle's private staff during the war.  Mayer says now that de Gaulle fed him \"a lot of nasty and often very justified comments on the way the United States treated France.\"</span></p> <p><span>In spite of these comments, Mayer liked working with the general.  \"I've had fairly close contact with several chiefs of state, and there's no doubt that de Gaulle was the star of the outfit,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>Mayer came to national attention in 1969 when he organized and chaired Nixon's First White House Conference on Food, Nutrition, and Health.  As a result of that conference, the number of food stamp and free school lunch recipients increased dramatically.</span></p> <p><span>Nixon was interested in the conference, Mayer said, because hunger was the only social problem that he believed he could solve in one term.  \"It is a paradox of history that while Nixon was not elected to feed the poor, he did more in that area than Kennedy or Johnson,\" Mayer observed.</span></p> <p><span>Mayer said he had good relations with Nixon, but he sometimes had problems with Haldeman and Erlichman, who feared the cost of new food programs.  Anytime they bothered him, however, Mayer went over their heads to the president. \"When the president would make brave speeches, Haldeman and Erlichman always saw them as rhetorical ploys--Nixon said it, but he didn't mean it,\" said Mayer.  \"Whether Nixon meant what he said or not, he got stuck with me and I was determined to take some action.\"</span></p> <p><span>As a member of the President's Consumer Advisory Council, Mayer thinks President Ford is \"much nicer in some ways than Mr. Nixon, but I find him far less supportive.\"</span></p> <p><span>Whether dealing with federal or Harvard bureaucrats, Mayer seems to have a flair for getting what he wants done.  \"He's very forceful and gets other people to do their best for him,\" said John R. Marquand, rotund and affable senior tutor at Dudley House.  \"He's not inclined to give in to bureaucratic opposition.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"When he believes in something, said Mayer's wife Betty, a petite, soft-spoken woman, \"he's so convincing that he carries other people along with him.\"</span></p> <p><span>If there is one group that Mayer has carried along with him, it is the members of Dudley House.  Many say they are convinced that no other House has a master who is as helpful and friendly as he is.</span></p> <p><span>\"The striking feature about Mayer is that he always makes an effort to stop students and initiate a conversation,\" sophomore Tom DiGiovanni said.  \"I haven't seen this in any other master.\"</span></p> <p><span>Esmeralda Santiago, a senior in Dudley, said, \"If you ever need a favor, he will do it for you.  He makes himself more available than any other master.\"</span></p> <p><span>With a little hesitation, Nicholas Koch '77 admitted, \"He's sort of like a father.\"</span></p> <p><span>Mayer agreed that he does like Dudley House.  \"I can spend an almost unlimited amount of time on this place.  That part of the job which involves listening and talking to people can take 24 hours a day,\" he explained.</span></p> <p><span>\"I think he really enjoys being master,\" said Marquand, who has worked with him for six years.  \"Unlike some people who are reluctant to be master, he wanted the job.  One of the reasons for this was that his son, Andre, had been chairman of the House committee.\"</span></p> <p><span>Betty Mayer said that her husband finds Dudley \"invigorating\" because he is not often with people the age of undergraduates.  Four of Mayer's own children are in their twenties and his youngest son is 15.</span></p> <p><span>Dudley House members including their master, annually scale Mount Monadnock in New Hampshire.  According to house legend, Mayer challenges the students to reach the peak before he does and every year he's the first one to the top.  Mayer laughed when asked about this story.  \"I'd despair about the general health of the population if out of all those students, there wasn't somebody who could get there before I do.  But,\" he quickly added, \"I did finish well before a number of students.\"</span></p> <p><span>Although Dudley is the largest Harvard House with all its members non-residents Mayer feels it is very cohesive because of the large number of activities it offers.  According to Marquand, Mayer is responsible for many of these activities.  In addition to a weekly open house at his master's lodging on 53 Dunster St., Mayer gives many parties at his house for student groups.  He has also developed an extensive House course program.</span></p> <p><span>A small House course that Mayer started several years ago has since grown to include 300 students and is now offered as Nat Sci 128, \"Nutrition.\"  Until Mayer introduced this course, there were no basic nutrition courses for undergraduates.</span></p> <p><span>\"Jean is a really solid bridge between the School of Public Health and the college.  A number of us here have seized upon the wedge he made into the Faculty of Arts and Sciences to try to introduce courses there,\" Public Health School's Gershoff said.  \"It's given me an opportunity to deal with undergraduates for the first time.\"</span></p> <p><span>Mayer's style of teaching is appreciated on both sides of the river.  Gershoff said, \"Jean is a good teacher in everything that the word implies.  He knows what he's talking about, has a feel for student needs, and gives interesting lectures.\"</span></p> <p><span>Sophmore Joanne Saia described his lecture style:  \"He keeps my interest very well which not too many people do.  Maybe it's because I like his accent.  He tells a few jokes, but he keeps his lectures sane.\"</span></p> <p><span>Mayer maintains a lab at the School of Pablic Health.  His research has centered on obesity and the regulation of food intake.  He is his discovery of how the amount of glucose in the blood affects hunger.  But his scientific work has not confined him to his laboratory.  Like his father, Mayer believes that scientific research should be transformed into action.  \"Jean has been particularly good at combining his scientific knowledge and the results of his research with program needs both in this county and abroad,\" Gershoff said.</span></p> <p><span>Mayer is a prolific writer.  In addition to about 650 articles in scientific journals, he has written several books.  His latest book, \"A Diet For Living\" was published last month.  \"It's the first completely non-technical book I've written and I have no idea whether I've succeeded,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>Approximately 30 million people read his nationally syndicated newspaper column.  He began the articles four years ago when he realized that he could reach people more easily by writing an educational column than by sittng on endless committees discussing how to educate the public about nutrition.</span></p> <p><span>In the Mayer household, it is Jean who does the family grocery shopping.  \"It's an essential part of writing my column,\" he said, adding that he spends a lot of time reading product labels.  \"One look at a label is enough to convince me that I want no part of some goods,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>Does Mayer follow the advice he gives to the public in his newspaper column?  According to his wife, he does.  \"Jean eats a lot of salad and fruit and he loves fish.  At home he doesn't have meat at all.\"  When she married Mayer in 1942, Betty didn't have to change her eating or cooking habits.  \"He wasn't a nutritionist yet,\" she explained.  \"But he had fairly simple eating habits even then.\"</span></p> <p><span>Mayer claims he's \"not at all a cook\" although he's interested in recipes from a nutritional standpoint.  When her husband does step into the kitchen, Betty said, it's ssually to make \"a marvelous salad.\"  And two or three times a year he stirs up \"something French.\"  His secret ambition, Betty revealed, is to learn to bake bread.  \"He's tried, but it hasn't been a success,\" she said.</span></p> <p><span>Mayer doesn't always practice what he preaches.  Throughout his career has emphasized the importance of exercise in weight control.  Betty claims, however, that he doesn't get enough exercise and, as a result, he puts on weight.  \"He says that travel and lack of time keep him from exercising,\" she explained.</span></p> <p><span>Lectures and conferences keep Mayer traveling around the world.  \"There are some weeks,\" explained Marquand, \"when I'll see him on Monday and Wednesday and won't even know that he was in Rome in the interim.\"</span></p> <p><span>No matter where he's traveled during the week, however, Mayer is always at home for open house on Friday afternoon.  \"I never miss those open houses,\" Mayer said.  \"It's important for the students to know that they can always find me there.\"</span></p> <p><span>Everyone seems to have his own theory on how Mayer manages to accomplish so much in a day.</span></p> <p><span>The John Marquand theory:  \"He's very energetic and he makes decisions quickly.  He's very good at supervising work and delegating authority.\"</span></p> <p><span>The Betty Mayer theory:  \"He doesn't live by a strict schedule, although he'd probably be better off is he did.  Whenever I travel with him I think, 'Now we'll have a chance to talk,' but he immediately settles himself down and goes to sleep.\"</span></p> <p><span>The Stanley Gershoff theory:  \"If there's one problem that Jean has it's that he's spread too thin.  It's only in the last two years that I've heard him talk of being tired.\"</span></p> <p><span>The Jean Mayer theory:  \"I think that the way most people conduct their lives, there are periods when they're involved in a variety of things.  For a number of years I just did research and whatever teaching went with it.\"</span></p> <p><span>As nutritionist, author, and government consultant, Mayer is a world-wide figure.  But fame brings its share of problems too.</span></p> <p><span>\"Jean's a star,\" said Gershoff.  \"And as soon as you become a star, people go for your throat.  If you do anything wrong, it gets magnified.  To be fair to people like Jean, you have to recognize that he has faults and then ask if his accomplishments are worthwhile.  When you look at Jean as a whole person, you come out with a big fat plus.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "1975 | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>T WAS NOT the best of times, it was not the worst of times.  It was, as Moynihan told us after Indira Gandhi had proved that a Watergate was impossible in India, the year that the United States became the world's largest democracy.  It was the year Kuwait surpassed the United States in per capita income and Italy beat France in per capita wine consumption.  The year Exxon became the world's largest corporation and the Comoro Islands the smallest member of the U.N.  It was the year everyone heard of South Molucca.</span></p> <p><span>But some of the things that <i>didn't</i> happen in 1975 were as important--and sometimes more important--than those that did.  There was no bloodbath in Vietnam after the fall of Saigon.  The world's economy did not collapse.  The Arabs didn't buy Disneyland.  New York City did not default--although no one is sure.  Neither Kissinger nor Moynihan returned to Harvard and we didn't get the Kennedy Library.</span></p> <p><span>Most things, of course, remained the same, as they always do.  Pope Paul called for peace on earth.  The New York Times noted that April, with its whippoorwills, arrived on schedule soon after the departure of March and its curlews and gusty winds.  On some fronts, though, we were losing fast.  The ozone layer was dissolving and the polar ice caps melting.  On the other hand, Venice stopped sinking.</span></p> <p><span>Nineteen seventy-five was a year that left few heroes intact or untarnished.  Many of the most interesting figures--Patty Hearst, Jimmy Hoffa, and Howard Hughes--remained largely out of view.  It was a catastrophic year for the best and the brightest, as JFK and Doris Kearns emerged with blotted copybooks, though for different reasons.  Attempts to create new heroes failed miserably, despite heroic efforts in the cases of Ruben \"Hurricane\" Carter and Joey \"Kid Blast\" Gallo.  And some shady characters weathered the year better than might be expected.  Idi Amin, Isabel Peron, Indira Gandhi, and Stephen S.J. Hall all cling tenaciously to office.</span></p> <p><span>But the verdict on 1975, like the verdict on its Bordeaux, will have to wait a few years.  Was it the year that saw Portugal firmly placed on the road to socialist democracy or simply a prelude to dictatorship by the extreme right or left?  Was it the start of a new era of independence for Angola or the start of a long, destructive civil war?  A watershed in Spain, the Mid-East, South Boston and Northern Ireland--or just the beginning of more of the same?</span></p> <p><span>Talleyrand said that no one who had not lived before 1789 knew how good life could really be.  1975 will probably never be thought of by anyone as such a critical dividing point in history.  1976 has a better chance.  It is, after all, the two hundredth anniversary of the end of the Roman Empire in the west.  Sobering thoughts--for Harvard and the world.</span></p>"}

{"title": "To the Valley Below | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>P</b>ART OF THE Dylan legend is the promise that one day we will finally know the \"real\" Dylan.  The promotion department at Columbia Records plays on this promise with the release of every new record--the hype for <i>Blood on the Tracks</i> went something like this:  \"You've heard the folk Dylan; you've heard the rock 'n' roll Dylan; you've heard the country Dylan; here, at last, is the <i>real</i> Dylan.\"</span></p> <p><span>Dylan himself doesn't seem to mind playing the game.  As his songs become less an expression of personal bitterness, a la <i>Positively 4th Street,</i> he appears to become more and more conscious of the distinction between himself and his persona--like Proust who, when he saw his readers approaching the early volumes of <i>A la Recherche du Temps Perdu</i> as a roman a clef, had his narrator relate an internal monologue in which he addresses himself as Marcel, then hastens to add, in parentheses, \"if indeed the narrator of this novel can be called Marcel.\"</span></p> <p><span>This self-consciousness is reflected in Dylan's later protest songs.  In <i>Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll</i> and <i>Only a Pawn in Their Game,</i> the word \"I\" never appeared.  He assumed his audience's sensibilities to be the same as his own--he could lay out his story and leaves it at that.  When he returned to protest, with <i>The Ballad of George Jackson,</i> he could no longer be so sure, and the song emphasized that these were his personal reactions to Jackson's murder:</span></p> <p><span>Sometimes I think this whole world</span></p> <p><span>Is one big prison yard,</span></p> <p><span>Some of us are jailers</span></p> <p><span>The rest of us are guards...</span></p> <p><span>Rubin Carter explains on the first page of his autobiography, <i>The Sixteenth Round,</i> that his name, Hurricane, \"provides an accurate description of the destructive forces that rage within my soul.\"  The book as a whole reveals a man with a frightening potential for violence and vengeance--Judge Larner and the all-white jury that convicted him must hope in the interest of their own physical safety that Hurricane be kept behind bars.  No mediating agent stands between Hurricane's sense of injustice and the outside world.  When as a boy a white drunk tried to rape a member of his gang, Rubin responded by slashing the man's head open.  When Hurricane was in custody and a cop called him \"nigger,\" it was a reflex to smash the man's face in.</span></p> <p><span>It's not surprising that Dylan should feel a certain kinship with Rubin.  His own sense of justice is removed from the world of judges and legislation--Dylan bringing his fury to bear on a victim as in <i>Like a Rolling Stone,</i> must feel a bit like a flurry of Rubin's punches.  When Dylan sings in the chorus \"One time he could've been/The Champion of the World,\" he's talking about more than a boxing title; he's suggesting a state in which relationships between people are informed by an intuitive sense of justice, rather than by a systematic but easily perverted legal code.  That Rubin's case means more to Dylan than a simple entanglement of a boxer with the law is emphasized by the way in which he is named:  in narrative verses he is identified as \"Rubin,\" or \"Rubin Carter,\" while in the choruses he is \"The Hurricane...,\"  \"This is the story of The Hurricane,\" and \"That's the story of The Hurricane,\" and \"That's the story of The Hurricane,\"--Dylan has raised Rubin to mythical status.</span></p> <p><span>The melodic structure of Hurricane is not very original; Dylan himself used this threatening pattern before, in <i>All Along the Watchtower.</i>  But it's effective.  Luther's congas charge through the chorus with the pace of horses' hoofbeats--the uninhibited power of Hurricane's vengeance.  The verses are short, clipped--the insistent bullying of a Patterson cop extracting the cooperation of Arthur Dexter Bradley:</span></p> <p><span>Remember that murder that happened in a bar?</span></p> <p><span>Remember you said you saw the getaway car?</span></p> <p><span>Think you'd like to play ball with the law?</span></p> <p><span>Think it might've been that fighter that you saw,</span></p> <p><span>Running, that night?  Don't forget that you are white!</span></p> <p><span>As has has ever since <i>The Ballad of George Jackson,</i> Dylan makes it clear that it is his own sense of justice that has been offended--the sense of justice of the, if you will, \"real\" Dylan.</span></p> <p><span>How can the life of such a man</span></p> <p><span>Be in the palm of some fool's hand?</span></p> <p><span>To see him obviously framed</span></p> <p><span>Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed</span></p> <p><span>To live in a land where justice is a game.</span></p> <p><span><i>Joey</i> follows directly from the tradition of Dylan songs epitomized by <i>John Wesley Harding:</i>  the title song, on first appearance, seems to be simply another tribute to the myth of the \"outlaw-hero\".  A closer listening, though, reveals that all of the traditionally apothesized qualities of the outlaw have been either turned on their head--\"he travelled with a gun in every hand\", \"with his lady by his side he took a stand\" (what self-respecting outlaw would make his stand with his lady by his side?); or else cloaked in puzzling ambiguity--\"he was never <i>known</i> to make a foolish move,\" \"the situation there was <i>all</i> but straightened out.\"</span></p> <p><span>The narrator of <i>Joey</i> is someone on the fringes of Gallo's circle, possibly a member of the New York theater crowd that turned him into a cultural hero even before he died.  The narrator identifies himself twice, once recalling the one time he saw Joey, after his release from prison in '71.</span></p> <p><span>He lost a little weight</span></p> <p><span>But he looked like Jimmy Cagney</span></p> <p><span>And I swear he did look great!</span></p> <p><span>Appropriately enough, Gallo is identified in the narrator's mind with a movie idol, with the cinematic image of a mobster.  The narrator appears next at Joey's funeral and declares piously</span></p> <p><span>Someday if God's in heaven</span></p> <p><span>Overlooking his preserve</span></p> <p><span>I know the men who shot him down</span></p> <p><span>Will get what they deserve</span></p> <p><span>No personal \"shame\" here, as there was for Dylan himself in <i>Hurricane,</i> but only an abstract, movie-like notion of a heavenly father handing out just rewards and punishments.</span></p> <p><span>The same inversions which dominated <i>John Wesley Harding</i> prevail in <i>Joey.</i>  He goes out to seek revenge for an attempt on his brother's life, but when the opportunity actually arises, Joey says, \"We're not those kind of men/It's peace and quiet that we need/To go back to work again.\"  Which sounds quite romantic and pacifist, but in context is saying simply that mob warfare is a poor atmosphere in which to conduct the business of gambing and numbers-running.  Upon his release from prison, \"He tried to find a way back in/To the life he'd left behind,\" but this is not Frank Sinatra coming back to Brooklyn after the service, looking for his finance and his old crowd:  Joey, Joey, what made them want to come and blow you away?\"  moan Dylan and Emmylou Harris in the chorus.  Safe to assume it had something to do with the fact that he arranged for the assassination attempt on Joseph Columbo.  Safe to assume too that Dylan knows that, in which case the chorus takes on a satirical quality.</span></p> <p><span><i>Isis</i> is reminiscent of Dylan's work on the <i>John Wesley Harding</i> album, particularly <i>As I Went Out One Morning</i> and <i>The Ballad of Frankie Lee</i> and <i>Judas Priest,</i> songs about false searches.  <i>Isis</i> begins with the narrator leaving Isis, the Egyptian goddess of perfect wife and motherhood for reasons left obscure.  He goes through a ritual of cutting off his hair and washing his clothes and meets a man who promises him easy wealth.  They travel to a country of \"pyramids embedded in ice\" and the narrator discovers that his companion is a grave-robber.  His imagination is inflamed--he has visions of turquoise, gold, and diamonds.  But the companion dies and instead of taking a body out of the pyramid, the narrator winds up throwing a body into it.  There are no riches inside, and the only thing left for him to do is return to Isis--\"just to tell her I love her.\"</span></p> <p><span>But because of his false search, he finds himself strangely isolated from her.  He finds her in a verse with echoes of Rimbaud's <i>Season in Hell</i> (\"One evening I pulled Beauty down on my knees.  I found her embittered and I cursed her.\")</span></p> <p><span>She was there, in the meadow, where the creek used to rise.</span></p> <p><span>Blinded by sleet, and in need of a bed</span></p> <p><span>I came in from the east, with the sun in my eyes</span></p> <p><span>I cursed her one time, then I rode on ahead.</span></p> <p><span>Their distance is accented in the next verse through the repeated use of the word <i>said</i>--in Dylan's songs, when anyone <i>says</i> anything, they tend to be concealing their true feelings.  This is the dominant motif of <i>Positively 4th Street</i> (You <i>say</i> I let you down/You know it's not like that...You say you lost your faith/But that's not where it's at); <i>Most Likely You Go Your Way, And I'll Go Mine</i> (You say you love me and you're thinking of me/But you know you could be wrong...); and <i>4th Time Around.</i>  It recurs here in <i>Isis,</i> and, given the narrator's account of his adventures the result is an astonishingly banal conversation.</span></p> <p><span>She said, \"Where ya been?\"</span></p> <p><span>I said, \"No place special.\"</span></p> <p><span>She said, \"You look different.\"</span></p> <p><span>I said, \"Well, I guess.\"</span></p> <p><span>She said, \"You been gone.\"</span></p> <p><span>I said, \"It's only natural.\"</span></p> <p><span>She said, \"You gonna stay?\"</span></p> <p><span>I said, \"If you want me to, yes.\"</span></p> <p><span>In the liner notes to the album, Allen Ginsberg describes Dylan's singing in <i>One More Cup of Coffee</i> as \"Hebraic cantillation,\" and indeed as Dylan chants the first verse of the song, you can imagine him as a cantor in a local synagogue chanting the Song of Songs:</span></p> <p><span>Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like</span></p> <p><span>Two jewels in the sky</span></p> <p><span>Your back is straight, your hair is smooth</span></p> <p><span>On the pillow where you lie</span></p> <p><span>But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love</span></p> <p><span>Your loyalty is not to me but to the stars above.</span></p> <p><span>Here Dylan introduces the theme of the alienated lover in its most extreme form.  Sensing that his lover is not on a plane where he can communicate directly to her, he can only describe her attributes.  In the next two verses he elaborates a male and a female principle; he characterizes her father as overseeing \"his kingdom, so no stranger does intrude,\" and one is reminded of one of the few pictures that exist of Sara Dylan, being sheparded through a crowd of photographers and reporters by her husband at the Isle of Wight.</span></p> <p><span>You sister sees the future</span></p> <p><span>Like your mama and yourself</span></p> <p><span>You've never learned to read or write</span></p> <p><span>There's no books upon your shelf And your pleasure knows no limits</span></p> <p><span>Your voice is like a meadowlark</span></p> <p><span>But your heart is like an ocean</span></p> <p><span>Mysterious and dark...</span></p> <p><span>Dylan continues to place women on pedestals, attributing to them a greater intimation of the mysteries of life and the future.  His attitude has, however, undergone a subtle change.  In the past he would write \"She's got everything she needs/She's an artist/She don't look back,\" and then go on to title the song <i>She Belongs to Me--</i>an arrogance there, a confidence that despite all of woman's potential for communion with nature, in the final analysis she was his to possess.  Things don't seem so certain anymore; womanhood appears to be too mysterious, too grand a thing for him to have or comprehend, and he can only ask for one more cup of coffee before he retreats \"to the valley below.\"</span></p> <p><span><i>Desire</i> begins with a brief glimpse of the \"real\" Dylan, and so it ends, with <i>Sara</i> and the revelation that he wrote <i>Sad-eyed Lady of the Lowlands</i> for her.  (Dylan will still play the game, though; Nat Hentoff reports that when Ginsberg asked Dylan for confirmation that the song was written for his wife, Dylan solemnly reminded him that Sara is the name of one of the Old Testament judges.)  In the earlier song, as in <i>One More Cup of Coffee,</i> he could only approach her through her attributes--thus, the proliferation of possessives (your mercury mouth...your eyes like smoke...your voice like chimes, etc.).  In addition, he ridiculed her other suitors as unworthy of her, and offered himself in their stead.</span></p> <p><span>My warehouse eyes, my arabian drums</span></p> <p><span>Should I leave them by your gate?</span></p> <p><span>Or sad-eyed lady, should I wait?</span></p> <p><span>Here, he said, are my visions, here are my songs--should I just leave them here for you, or will you take me, too?  The assumption was, of course that she would.</span></p> <p><span>After eleven years of marriage, he still senses distance between them, and <i>Sara</i> is an achingly desperate attempt to connect back up with her as a woman.  He summons up memories of their children playing on the beach as babies, for it's through them that he feels closest to her, then memories of her, which remain only apparitions, with no history:</span></p> <p><span>How did I meet you?  I don't know</span></p> <p><span>A messenger sent me in a tropical storm</span></p> <p><span>You were there in the winter,</span></p> <p><span>Moonlight on the snow,</span></p> <p><span>And on Lily Pond Lane,</span></p> <p><span>When the weather was warm.</span></p> <p><span>Unable to penetrate her mystery, (So easy to look at/So hard to define) he can only, in true poet's fashion, give her names--\"sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life...scorpio sphinx in a calico dress...glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow\"--and finally, simply, ask of her, \"Don't ever leave me/Don't ever go.\"</span></p> <p><span>With <i>Desire,</i> Dylan seems to be reaching out for a new audience; of his last three albums, it is easily the most listenable.  Robbie Robertson's eerie guitar riffs on <i>Planet Waves</i> have been replaced by Scarlet Rivera's soothing, melodic violin line.  <i>Planet Waves</i> was a depressing album--even <i>Wedding Song</i> which was cited by Newsweek as evidence of Dylan's new \"mellowness\" contained disturbing lines about love which \"cut like a knife,\" about loving someone \"more than madness.\"  <i>Blood on the Tracks</i> was a transition, containing some of the bitterness of <i>Planet Waves,</i> but, particularly with <i>Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts,</i> it pointed towards <i>Desire.</i>  Now, no longer \"preoccupied with his vengeance,\" he can concentrate on experimenting with a variety of song-forms--ballads like <i>Black Diamond Bay,</i> protest songs <i>(Hurricane),</i> satire <i>(Joey),</i> and Chants <i>(One More Cup of Coffee).</i>  He even appears to be enough at peace with himself to, as in <i>Sara,</i> reveal the \"real\" Dylan.</span></p>"}
