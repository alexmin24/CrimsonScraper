{"title": "Constitutional Discrimination | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>President Bush\u2019s official announcement late last month to support the Federal Marriage Amendment, which would rewrite the Constitution to prevent same-sex marriage, came as no surprise. In fact, it is almost humorous that CNN would send out a breaking news update to alert its subscribers of this fact. Bush has danced around the issue of same-sex marriage for months, attempting to allow conservative analysts the time to calculate his political strategy. His State of the Union address this year offered a hint at what was to come, but shied away from any explicit statements.</span></p> <p><span>In the end, it took Karl Rove a little less than a month to prepare his puppet for an announcement that affirmed support for one of the most egregious acts of proposed legislation of this new century.</span></p> <p><span>As usual, Bush\u2019s rhetoric in the Feb. 24 speech did not go far beyond reiterating empty allusions to his narrow perception of the United States\u2019 \u201ccultural, religious and natural roots.\u201d By this he refers to the cultural hegemony of an Anglo-Saxon, Protestant conservatism. Allowing same-sex couples the right to enter into civil marriage in the United States does not, however, impinge in any way on the cultural or religious freedoms that Bush claims to protect. Instead, it affords bisexual, gay, lesbian and transgender (BGLT) people a legal status that is granted unconditionally to heterosexual couples upon request.</span></p> <p><span>In many ways, the Federal Marriage Amendment launches us back to 1912, when Rep. Seaborn Roddenberry, D-Ga., introduced an amendment to ban interracial marriage. In his speech before Congress, Roddenberry said, \u201cIntermarriage between whites and blacks is repulsive and averse to every sentiment of pure American spirit...It is destructive of moral supremacy, and ultimately this slavery to black beasts will bring this nation to a fatal conflict.\u201d The same hateful rhetoric that Roddenberry espoused more than 90 years ago can now be seen flowing from the mouths of the religious right about same-sex marriage. But attitudes are changing, and it will not be long before Bush\u2019s comments are seen by the general populace to be as despicable as Roddenberry\u2019s.</span></p> <p><span>Bush asks his fellow Americans to \u201cconduct this difficult debate in a manner worthy of our country, without bitterness or anger.\u201d President Bush, the Bisexual, Gay, Lesbian, Transgender and Supporters Alliance (BGLTSA) is angry, and we have every right to be bitter. Bush has trampled on the rights of BGLT people for far too long, and this time he has gone too far. He may be able to silence  Mary Cheney, but he certainly cannot quiet queer America.</span></p> <p><span>Rallies around the country, from Boston to San Francisco, are raising the consciousness of a nation. We are not willing to accept the illogical and inane arguments of the religious right. The website of the Alliance for Marriage, a coalition formed to encourage \u201cmore children raised in a home with a mother and a father,\u201d cites an article asserting that \u201c\u2018gay marriage\u2019 devalues women.\u201d The article states emphatically that women (or men) would be rendered superfluous in a world of same-sex marriages\u2014but it refuses to show how two men or women choosing to enter the institution of marriage will degrade the institution of marriage for heterosexuals. Matt Daniels, president of the Alliance for Marriage, asserts that \u201cmarriage is the key to reducing the high levels of youth crime and child poverty.\u201d Even if we believe this claim, though, it\u2019s still hard to see how Daniels can get away with scapegoating the BGLT population instead of addressing the divorce and broken homes that are the endpoint for so many heterosexual marriages. Illogical arguments like this only serve to incite hatred and violence against BGLT people.</span></p> <p><span>The United States Constitution is not a place for zealots and bigots to enshrine discrimination, especially when an ABC News/Washington Post poll reported that 48 percent of respondents said that the states should decide on the issue of same-sex marriage, whereas only 43 percent actually supported the proposed amendment. With or without widespread support, though, this amendment is a miscarriage of justice that would create a constitutionally-delineated second-class status for the BGLT population.</span></p> <p><span>The text of the proposed Federal Marriage Amendment does not stop at defining marriage as a \u201cunion of a man and a woman\u201d\u2014it goes on to strip some BGLT people of the domestic partnership benefits that they have fought valiantly to gain over the past decades. Supporters of the amendment have claimed that it would continue to allow non-marriage civil unions, but the proposed amendment unambiguously states, \u201cNeither this Constitution or the constitution of any State, nor state or federal law, shall be construed to require that marital status or the legal incidents thereof be conferred upon unmarried couples or groups.\u201d The \u201clegal incidents\u201d of marriage that are offered by many states, counties, cities and employers are vital to the livelihoods of BGLT people. Retracting these rights would not only disallow the ability of BGLT people to take advantage of tax benefits and access to estates, but it would prohibit them as well from visiting their loved ones in hospitals as anything more than a friend.</span></p> <p><span>As the debate about the Federal Marriage Amendment grows near, there is an increased need for activism. Living in Cambridge, Harvard students have the incredible opportunity to be at the forefront of this battle for equality. Despite the unlikelihood of the amendment gaining the two-thirds support in both houses of Congress and the support of constitutional conventions in 38 states that it needs to become law, it is imperative that we support efforts to end discrimination against the BGLT population. Write letters to your state senators encouraging them to join the fight or thanking them for their support. And join the BGLTSA on March 11 at noon at the Massachusetts State House to oppose parallel efforts to write in discrimination to the Massachusetts state constitution. Let us hope the next time there is a CNN breaking news update, it reads, \u201cFederal Marriage Amendment Fails in Congress.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><i>Adam P.

{"title": "A Cracked Shield | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>President Bush\u2019s national missile defense plan may take a decade to fully implement, but it took Russia less than one presidential term to undermine it. The Russian military announced last week that it successfully tested a hypersonic missile capable of actively evading present\u2014and future\u2014missile defense systems. And, although the network of radar stations and interceptor missiles Bush envisions was never supposed to defend against a Russian attack, this development nonetheless underscores how wasteful and counterproductive America\u2019s nascent missile defense system is.</span></p> <p><span>Establishing a national ballistic missile shield has always been a case study in futility. The technology required to fire decoys\u2014multiple warheads on one rocket that can hopelessly confuse interceptor missiles\u2014is all too easy for a rogue state or terrorist group to employ but difficult for the United States to defend against, even after spending the $100 billion that the Congressional Budget Office predicts the shield will cost. (Of course, estimates such as these also usually fall woefully short of the final cost.) And now, with Russia\u2019s new missile technology\u2014which a rogue state could acquire through theft or bribery from Russia\u2019s decrepit military infrastructure\u2014hitting the right missile will get even harder because incoming missiles will be able to change direction mid-flight to avoid a U.S. interceptor.</span></p> <p><span>As distressing as Russia\u2019s new hypersonic missile may be, its development was rather predictable. Bush\u2019s unilateral decision in December 2001 to withdraw from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty with Russia set the stage for a miniature arms race. The ABM treaty existed to maintain the long-standing, effective principle of mutually assured destruction (MAD). MAD, however, requires that the each country accept some level of vulnerability\u2014and with Bush refusing to do so, Russia felt compelled to develop systems capable of penetrating present and future U.S. defenses.</span></p> <p><span>But national missile defense doesn\u2019t just miss the mark when it comes to relatively sophisticated attacks from other countries. It also does nothing to combat America\u2019s twenty-first-century threats. We have argued\u2014since long before September 2001\u2014that the billions of dollars squandered on a second Star Wars plan could be better spent shoring up defenses from actual terrorist threats than from intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). Sept. 11, 2001 showed that even a well-funded terrorist organization such as al Qaeda found it much more practical to attack the U.S. cheaply than with expensive ICBMs. With the U.S. military undersupplied in Iraq, the Department of Homeland Security not fully funded and this year\u2019s federal budget likely to be almost half a trillion dollars in the red, the $9 billion Bush wants to spend on missile defense next year should go to real anti-terrorism efforts.</span></p> <p><span>As President Bush prepared to invade Iraq and depose Saddam Hussein last year, he encountered an international community that did not trust him or his intentions. The trouble he had persuading the United Nations to endorse an attack was caused, in part, by his repeated attacks on essential international agreements, from opposing the International Criminal Court and the Kyoto protocol to imposing illegal steel tariffs. The irresponsible decision to withdraw from the ABM treaty and pursue missile defense two years ago was but one stitch in Bush\u2019s pattern of offending the rest of the world in pursuit of some dubious objective. And now that the U.S. is out of the ABM treaty and Russia has responded, the only thing America has gained from missile defense is a deeper deficit. Bush should abandon missile defense now and focus on worthy priorities.</span></p>"}

What puzzles me, however, is that the coal-burning power industry seems to disagree.</span></p> <p><span>Evidence shows that contamination from mercury is extremely dangerous. Mercury poisoning can cause severe neurological and developmental damage as it affects the way information is processed by the brain\u2014sensory perception in particular. Moreover, this type of poisoning is especially harmful to children and pregnant women yet, sadly, such a danger is not far removed.</span></p> <p><span>Mercury pollution can easily enter the food web and infect what we eat. By tainting our rivers and marine life, the bio-accumulative substance directly threatens public health. In fact, 41 states currently have fish-consumption advisories due to mercury poisoning. And, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 8 percent of women of childbearing age have mercury in their blood exceeding levels deemed safe by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\u2014clearly some unsettling statistics.</span></p> <p><span>Yet, it seems that the EPA is willing to do some backpedaling. Recently, the agency caved into industry lobbies and weakened previously-set regulatory policies. In a document released by the government late last year, the EPA decided to revise its December 2000 findings (in which it placed mercury under the most stringent regulations of the Clean Air Act alongside other neurotoxins such as asbestos, chromium and lead) to place mercury under a significantly less stringent provision of the Act which deals with pollutants less toxic to humans, such as smog.</span></p> <p><span>The revision came about as a result of intense pressure from the coal-burning power industry, whose concern for cost and profit has led to fierce resistance to the regulations. But, it\u2019s none other than coal-burning power plants that serve as the largest providers of unregulated airborne mercury pollution. Pumping out about 48 tons per year, these plants obviously pose a huge hazard to our health yet are receiving unduly lenient treatment.</span></p> <p><span>The thing is, this is not even about environmental health. This is about human health. Yet it appears that those who stand to benefit from the new lenience see public health worth trading for profits.</span></p> <p><span>Mercury cannot be treated as benign as smog. It is a very dangerous pollutant and, as research has shown, belongs in the category of neurotoxins. The Bush administration\u2019s weakened regulations may save the power industry hundreds of millions of dollars\u2014yet another instance of its characteristically lax laws with regard to big industry\u2014but they won\u2019t be able to address the real harm quickly enough. Without requiring across-the-board regulation, there will still be mercury build-up and concentrated areas of pollution; the substance will continue to taint our waters and affect our population.</span></p> <p><span>Pharmaceutical companies have stopped using mercury-based preservative for vaccines. Hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices are replacing mercury-based blood pressure gauges with alternative instruments. And one state, Connecticut, is taking the lead in initiating a ban on mercury-based thermometers. At a time when mercury is being phased out from its other uses, we cannot allow the 1,100 coal- and oil- fired power plants\u2014the largest source of mercury pollution\u2014to simply slide by.</span></p> <p><span><i>Saritha Komatireddy '05, a Crimson editorial editor, is a government concentrator in Winthrop House.</i></span></p>"}
{"title": "Drug Bust | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Should pharmaceutical companies be allowed to overcharge Americans for drugs developed with taxpayer dollars? That\u2019s the question recently put to the Bush Administration by Essential Medicines, a Washington watchdog organization.</span></p> <p><span>In 1980, Congress passed the Bayh-Dole Act, allowing inventors to retain ownership of drugs developed with the help of federal grants. The promise of profits, it was hoped, would spur companies and universities to bring these inventions to market; economic incentives would be harnessed in the service of the public welfare.</span></p> <p><span>But Bayh-Dole also granted the government so-called \u201cmarch-in rights,\u201d empowering it to circumvent privately held patents if a drug were not made \u201cavailable to the public on reasonable terms\u201d or if \u201cnecessary to alleviate health or safety needs.\u201d On Jan. 29, Essential Medicines petitioned Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson to exercise these rights for the first time and allow for competitive production of Xalatan and Norvir\u2013two blockbuster drugs that are scandalously overpriced.</span></p> <p><span>With worldwide sales now exceeding a billion dollars annually, Xalatan, a glaucoma drug, has proven to be one of Pfizer\u2019s biggest moneymakers. Yet although the drug\u2019s initial research was funded by a $4 million federal grant, American consumers today pay two to five times more for Xalatan than their Europe counterparts. Norvir, a critical AIDS medication, was also developed with the help of taxpayer dollars. It too has earned millions for its manufacturer, Abbott Laboratories. But seeking bigger profits, Abbott raised the price of Norvir by an unprecedented 400 percent last December.</span></p> <p><span>The Norvir case is particularly troubling. Used as a boosting agent to increase the potency of other AIDS drugs, Norvir is an essential component of many treatment regimes. Although costs will vary between treatment plans, Abbott\u2019s price hike will set many AIDS patients back anywhere from an extra $6000 to $12,000 per year.</span></p> <p><span>Abbott\u2019s actions have angered not just AIDS activists; other big name pharmaceutical companies\u2013like Bristol-Myers Squibb and GlaxoSmithKline\u2013are also livid. These companies produce AIDS drugs that must be combined with Norvir for optimal efficacy, so the Norvir price increase effectively raises the cost of their drugs as well. But Abbott has declined to pass along the Norvir price hike to its own combination drug, Kaletra (which is pre-boosted with Norvir), thereby undercutting its competitors. A savvy business move? Certainly. Kaletra will doubtless gain increased market share as higher Norvir prices force AIDS patients to switch off of their old treatment regimes. But this market manipulation will likely have serious medical consequences. AIDS patients often respond better to certain drugs than to others, and changes in treatment increase the risk of developing drug resistance. Treatment choices should be driven by medical expertise, not by cynical price fixing.</span></p> <p><span>Pharmaceutical companies have always had a ready defense for high prices: given the hefty costs of drug development and the high chances of failure, they argue, big profits are necessary in order to fund continued R&amp;D. Defending Xalatan\u2019s price tag, a Pharmacia exec (that company has since been bought out by Pfizer) told the New York Times, \u201cWe are bringing forth innovation . . . and innovation always brings a premium.\u201d True, but how much incentive do these companies really need? After all, taxpayer dollars paid for 85 percent of the basic and clinical research for drugs currently on the market. And a closer look at company balance sheets reveals that the pharmaceutical industry spends 27 percent of its revenues on marketing, compared to a paltry 11 percent on R&amp;D (Pfizer spends 35 percent on marketing and only 15 percent on R&amp;D; Abbott is no better, spending 23 percent on marketing and 10 percent on R&amp;D). To top it off, the pharmaceutical industry is also the world\u2019s most profitable, raking in three times the Fortune 500 average.</span></p> <p><span>Indeed, despite all the worries about endangering innovation, R&amp;D expenditures will likely increase if the Bush Administration chooses to exercise its march-in rights in the Norvir and Xalatan cases. That\u2019s because the Essential Inventions petitions include a clever stipulation that would require generic producers to contribute a small sum to an R&amp;D fund for every pill they sell. Generic manufacturers could easily afford to make these contributions while offering cheaper prices and earning healthy profits to boot.</span></p> <p><span>Xalatan and Norvir are as cut-and-dry a pair of march-in cases as the government is likely ever to face. If Secretary Thompson fails to act, he will not only ensure that Norvir and Xalatan remain inaccessible for many American consumers; he will set a damning precedent for years to come. The Bayh-Dole Act established private ownership of federally supported inventions as a means to better serve the public welfare. But government inaction would turn that calculus on its head, instantiating corporate profits as ends in themselves.</span></p> <p><span><i>Sasha Post \u201905 is a social studies concentrator in Adams House.

{"title": "The Future of Black Studies | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Last semester, Professor Manning Marable of Columbia University delivered a lecture entitled \u201cThe Future of Black Studies\u201d for the Dubois Institute at Harvard University. He raised a number of critiques of the academic discipline at this moment in time and offered a glimpse of what he believes is the solution to the \u201ccrisis\u201d in African and African-American studies. With the impending, acrimonious departures of Tishman and Diker Professor of Sociology and of African and African-American Studies Lawrence D. Bobo and Associate Professor of African and African-American Studies Marcyliena Morgan, it is time to talk frankly about the state of the field at a higher level. Taking Marable\u2019s critiques and ideas into account, a number of challenges need to be put forth to the intellectuals in the discipline. Harvard\u2019s Dubois Institute, by virtue of the overwhelming talent and prestige of the department, as well as the media coverage garnered every time there is any tension between the department and the larger university, is in a particularly powerful position to answer these challenges and defend the discipline against renewed criticisms of its legitimacy as an academic discipline and its relevance in the larger world.</span></p> <p><span>Marable\u2019s first demand was that the black studies community redefine the history of black political thought and activism to situate it within the era of globalization\u2014an extremely valid criticism that reflects a division in the discipline. Many black academics are caught within a paleo-liberal ideological framework, which does not reflect the rising tide of immigration or an understanding of contemporary global political economy. Much of the teaching of black political history is still couched in the binary conflict of integrationist versus separatist, which may be useful for middle school, but which is not particularly helpful in determining which ideological tools from past black intellectuals should be restructured to organize blacks in the present day. Pure separatism is now unfeasible, while full integration has largely failed, with the majority of black people in the U.S. living and learning in de facto segregation 50 years after Brown v. Board.</span></p> <p><span>Moreover, with blacks in the third world occupying the lowest rungs in the global economy, we need to explore Marable\u2019s idea of a \u201cnew racial domain\u201d and see how structural racism, mass unemployment and incarceration, disease and disenfranchisement lower the life chances of blacks <i>globally</i>. Instead of disregarding the political thought of Marcus Garvey or Malcolm X as anachronistic or misguided, it might be time to resurrect the Pan-African focus in order to combat the most severe crisis in the African Diaspora since colonialism. We live in a world where those with power and resources are either flagrantly inattentive or maliciously disengaged from this plight because there is no joint intellectual and grassroots pressure. For example, we praise President Bush\u2019s $15 billion AIDS initiative, but Europeans spend $11 billion a year on ice cream alone. For those not yet convinced, I offer the lack of sufficient response to the rampant genocide of black Africans in Sudan. Maybe we should tell the president that the Sudanese aren\u2019t black, they\u2019re just covered in oil.</span></p> <p><span>Marable\u2019s second demand was that black studies combine with a new model of civic engagement in order to enact change. To that end, I offer that faculty can impact the grassroots by organizing\u2014drumroll please\u2014students! The apathy with which many intellectuals credit our generation is a result of being bombarded with statistics about poverty and hopelessness without being offered mentorship as we seek to solve these dilemmas. With no meaningful guidance, many black students decide to major in law, business, or medicine with a minor in black magic\u2014the study of how to be invisible to poor black people.</span></p> <p><span>Many black academics are proficient at delivering depressing statistics, but they have not quite mastered the art of helping students organize solutions to such problems. Therefore, politically engaged black students are often at the mercy of left-wing activists who grapple with their own racial insecurities, washed-up black politicians and broad yet tenuous interethnic coalitions that disintegrate over cleavage issues. Few black intellectuals willingly offer themselves as mentors to existing student groups who are attempting to do exciting organizing around hip-hop politics or AIDS. As a result, black intellectuals appear aloof and students are more interested in Halo 2 than social justice.</span></p> <p><span>Finally, Marable challenged the black studies community to create professional structures that facilitate better scholarship and respond to outside attempts to redefine its academic scope. This is key to the survival of black studies as an important and legitimate discipline. Over fifty years ago, Gunnar Myrdal scolded Americans for demanding objectivity in \u201clegitimate\u201d scholarship. Scholarship is legitimized when it identifies a problem or question and seeks to solve it. Black studies\u2014an attempt to solve the problem of racism and racial inequality worldwide\u2014has in many ways been moved away from the goal that defines it. While black intellectuals have attempted to remain ivory-tower-objective, the right wing has launched a multi-layered attack on the credibility of the whole field of ethnic studies, and the liberal establishment has attempted to recast the field as a producer of \u201cdiversity\u201d and a facility for cultural tourism.</span></p> <p><span>Without a strong, centralized defense by its leading scholars, the field is in danger of becoming irrelevant\u2014both academically and politically\u2014substantially undermining the intellectual foundation necessary for black progress. This is by no means an all-out assault on black academics, especially those here at Harvard who do brilliant and meaningful work that can benefit us all. But we can do better, if only because we have to.</span></p> <p><span><i>Brandon M. Terry \u201905 is a government and African and African American studies concentrator in Lowell House.

I would like to share with your readers the perspective of an American living overseas.</span></p> <p><span>George W. Bush, in my view, is a radical, not a conservative.</span></p> <p><span>Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld have cast aside the prudent, bi-partisan American foreign policy developed since World War II. American Presidents consistently have decided that pre-emptive attacks are called for only in the most narrow and well-justified circumstances. It was clear in 2003, and is even more clear today, that Iraq posed no clear and present danger to America and that the circumstances did not meet the hurdle required for a pre-emptive invasion.</span></p> <p><span>Kerry correctly explained during the debate the high standard that American foreign policy must meet. Especially when we launch a pre-emptive invasion of another country, an American president must be able to explain to our citizens why that invasion was essential and unavoidable. He or she also should be in a position to persuade our friends around the world that this is the case.</span></p> <p><span>I have spoken with many people here in London who are very friendly towards America, but believe as I do that the current Bush Administration has failed to uphold the finest American traditions.</span></p> <p><span><b></b></span></p> <p><span>JOHN P.

{"title": "Pity the Kurds | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Largely ignored in the current coverage of the crisis in Iraq is the continuing plight of the Kurdish people. The slaughter of Saddam\u2019s gas attacks in the late 1980\u2019s stands out in the public consciousness, yet few have a historical perspective broad enough to truly understand the duration and severity of the oppression that has been foisted upon the Kurds.</span></p> <p><span>It\u2019s no exaggeration to say that the Kurds are victims of one of history\u2019s greatest ongoing tragedies; they\u2019ve been consistently tortured, killed, oppressed and forcibly unsettled for well over a century. And while there are certain similarities between the mistreatments of the Kurds and the repression of other minorities\u2014the Armenians and the Jews come immediately to mind\u2014the Kurds are unique in that they have no state of their own. They were promised a state in the Treaty of Sevres in the aftermath of the First World War, but Kemal Ataturk\u2019s ascension to power in Turkey prevented this from happening.</span></p> <p><span>A sizeable presence in the Middle East, the Kurds number roughly 20 million and reside in a broad swathe from Southeastern Turkey, to Northern Iraq and Western Iran. The largest concentration of Kurds in the region\u2014around 10 million\u2014resides in Turkey and comprises upwards of 20 percent of the country\u2019s population.</span></p> <p><span>For being such a substantial minority in Turkey, the Kurds enjoy little in the way of representation or freedom. The Turkish government severely repressed Kurdish culture to such an extent that children couldn\u2019t even be given Kurdish names until as little as a decade ago. But because of its desire to join the European Union, the Turkish government has begun publicly imploring the acceptance of the Kurds residing within its borders. These efforts though, for the most part, disguise the ongoing draconian regulation of the Kurds. Just this past July, several Kurdish activists were charged by Turkish police for speaking in their native tongue at a political rally. While the trumped-up charges were later dropped because of massive international outcry, the fact that they were levied at all demonstrates clearly that Kurds still have a long road to full equality.</span></p> <p><span>The terrible suffering of the Kurds continues apace in the cauldron of postwar Iraq, as the recent massive car bombing in the unofficial Kurdish capital of Kirkuk and the beheading of three Kurds by insurgents have gruesomely illustrated. These two vile acts are merely small additions to the long list of outrages suffered since the removal of Saddam Hussein. Kurds stand out as targets not only because of their ethnicity and language, but also because of their staunchly pro-American actions. The Kurds are deeply grateful for America\u2019s creation of the \u201cno fly zone,\u201d which enabled them to enjoy at least some sense of autonomy after the First Gulf War ended. The Kurd\u2019s famed peshmerga militias played a significant part in Operation Iraqi Freedom and continue to battle against the terrorists waging a guerilla campaign.</span></p> <p><span>While our policing of the no-fly zone allowed the creation of a nominally independent Kurdish nation, we owe the Kurds a far greater historical debt. This is primarily because they are one of the few reliable allies we have in the region; the proto self-government centered on Kirkuk has been resolutely and nearly unflinchingly pro-American over the past decade. However, our reasons for further helping the Kurds are not limited to their current assistance to our cause. Twice in the past century the Kurdish people have responded to the calls of American presidents to overthrow their oppressors, only to rise up and be slaughtered by the thousands. While the Kurds heeded Woodrow Wilson and George H.W. Bush, if the only outcome of following American desires is mass slaughter they would be wary of aiding us in the future; and the Kurds occupy too strategically important an area to risk loosing as allies.</span></p> <p><span>Virtually every other people that have suffered as greatly as the Kurds have come out of the experience possessing a nation of their own, but the Kurds remain stateless. No country that lies within the traditional Kurdish homeland grants full freedom or protection\u2014as of today there is still no nation where the Kurds can truly be Kurdish. If we can salvage little from our invasion of Iraq, a true Kurdish homeland where the Kurds can live in peace and with dignity should be at the top of the list.</span></p> <p><span><i>Mark A.

{"title": "Debate, Don't Advertise | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>This past Thursday, thousands of students across the nation played drinking games to the first presidential debate. For those who took a shot whenever one of the candidates mentioned words such as \u201cinconsistent,\u201d \u201csummit\u201d or \u201cweapons of mass destruction,\u201d it must have been quite a night\u2014last week\u2019s debate was largely repetitive, superficial and content-free.</span></p> <p><span>The absurdly specific guidelines the parties hashed out before the event have already been widely reported\u2014and ridiculed\u2014even in the generally pliant mainstream American media. Instead of a meaningful discourse, Americans heard prepared answers to questions on pre-approved issues in a pre-negotiated format. Friday\u2019s program was not a debate by traditional standards: It resembled a contest to see who could go ninety minutes without slipping-up more than it did an effort to delve into the complicated substance of pressing issues like the bubbling quagmire of Iraq, nuclear proliferation and the crumbling of democracy in Russia.</span></p> <p><span>Indeed, those voters that could keep their eyes open for the full 90 minutes learned remarkably little about either candidate\u2019s policies. Why is President George Bush so convinced that China would leave the bargaining table and pout if the United States facilitated bilateral talks between the Koreas? Does John Kerry have a real exit strategy for Iraq, or is he just relying on the questionable notion that the rest of the world will swoop in from the wings to aid a Kerry administration stuck with President Bush\u2019s mess? The American people missed out on a vital layer of complexity Thursday night. And the sad part is that the debate went the way it was supposed to go.</span></p> <p><span>The root of the problem lies in the way the debates are organized. After the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD)\u2014an \u201cindependent\u201d group in fact controlled by the two major parties\u2014took control of administering televised presidential debates from the League of Women Voters in 1988, the Democrats and the Republicans have been able to jointly dictate the terms on which their candidates will appear. The results have been all-too obvious\u2014candidates avoid dangerous issues and spontaneous or interactive formats.</span></p> <p><span>We do not expect control of presidential debates to be wrested from the parties any time soon. But we whole heartedly endorse groups such as Citizens\u2019 Debate Commission and Open Debate, which are trying to put a truly independent and non-partisan body back in charge\u2014to make presidential debates less like extended political advertisements and more like Lincoln-Douglass. For the sake of meaningful democracy, we hope they succeed in removing the CPD as sponsor of the presidential debates.</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps the most disappointing and dangerous aspect of the status quo is that voters might actually form their opinions about the candidates from the substance-less drivel Americans got a taste of Thursday. Until the presidential debates improve significantly, all we can hope is that voters manage to inform themselves despite a dearth of valuable political discourse.</span></p>"}

{"title": "1968 Revisited | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>\u201cThe past is never dead,\u201d Faulkner famously said.  \u201cIt isn\u2019t even past.\u201d  As if to prove him right, the press stayed busy last week exploring the dubious narrative of how President Bush got into, and out of, service in the National Guard during the Vietnam War, eyeing its implications for the coming election. Not to be outdone, Republicans seized on a recently unearthed Crimson interview of John Kerry from his youthful war-protesting days, as well as two photos (one real, one forged) of him appearing within sight of Jane Fonda, hated to this day by many veterans for her anti-war views.  It was another sign that the ghosts of Vietnam are alive and howling this political cycle. \u00a0From the strained Vietnam-Iraq analogy to the Kerry-Clark competition over who was more of a war hero, much of this election is happening in terms of that painful experience.  Yet pundits and politicians this year have mostly ignored one of the most important episodes of the Vietnam era: the violence surrounding the 1968 Democratic Convention.</span></p> <p><span>When Democrats convened in 1968 to nominate Hubert Humphrey in Chicago, violence erupted in the surrounding streets as law enforcement clashed with students gathered to protest Lyndon Johnson\u2019s war.  Inside the hall, one Senator denounced the \u201cGestapo tactics\u201d of Mayor Daley\u2019s police, while the nation watched aghast as their televisions carried images of students being beaten outside.  Incredibly, no one was killed, but the violence became one of many bitter moments etched in the nation\u2019s memory of the turbulent \u201960s.</span></p> <p><span>The world is very different now.  Conventions have devolved from intense and unpredictable political events to vacuous and scripted shows, and George W. Bush is about as different from LBJ as a Texan president could be.  But the way things are shaping up, America will have to take care to avoid an ugly and familiar scene at the 2004 Republican convention in New York City.</span></p> <p><span>It was about a year ago that the RNC announced that the Republicans would convene in New York, even though they had avoided that city as a convention site for 150 years, and that they would hold the convention in September, even though these things are usually done in July.  Of course, the GOP scoffed at allegations that the location and scheduling had anything to do with a desire to use 9/11 for political gain.  At the time, it seemed like a clever (if sinister) move; but now, some think it will backfire.</span></p> <p><span>Politically speaking, the tragedy of 9/11 just isn\u2019t what it used to be for Bush.  Once an automatic applause line for the president, it is showing signs of turning into a vulnerability.  Bush is taking increasing heat for his reluctance to cooperate with the federal commission investigating the attacks, most recently in the form of an outraged demand from the Family Steering Committee that he testify in public to the commission, providing a series of embarrassing questions for him to answer.  It\u2019s another sign that the attacks are no longer a bulletproof vest for the president\u2014and if his political force-field fizzles, New York may be about the last place he\u2019ll want to visit.</span></p> <p><span>The City is a liberal stronghold, and one of the hottest spots for the massive anti-war protests that began one year ago last week.  Among the millions who demonstrated worldwide, at least a hundred thousand were on the streets of New York, in a throng that stretched  20 blocks long and three wide.  So it\u2019s hard to imagine a sedate response when the entire Republican power structure descends on New York to re-affirm their commitment to four more years of this presidency.</span></p> <p><span>In a tiny hint of what lies ahead, the New York Times reported last week on an episode of street theater by a group called \u201cBillionaires for Bush,\u201d which gathered outside a posh Republican fundraiser in the City, chanting mock slogans like \u201cFour More Wars\u201d and \u201cRe-Elect Rove.\u201d A group advocating for the poor has already vowed to erect \u201cBushville\u201d tent cities around the convention site, and websites like rncnotwelcome.org offer resources to New Yorkers and travelers who seek to \u201csubvert this carefully staged affair.\u201d (The GOP seems to be taking this seriously, having quickly bought up the similar-sounding rncnotwelcome.com address and linking it to their own party website.)  In a city where 81 percent of the residents voted for Al Gore, the capital of the blue states, it\u2019s hard to imagine that organizers will have a hard time generating a massive demonstration.</span></p> <p><span>I asked Tom Hayden, who earned worldwide fame as one of the \u201cChicago Seven\u201d put on trial for organizing the 1968 demonstrations, whether he thought the violence of conventions past might rear its ugly head in 2004.  Hayden, whose notoriety was rekindled on this campus when Harvard\u2019s own Miami Four were arrested after traveling with him to observe globalization protests in December, says that while it\u2019s a different time, he\u2019s worried about a parallel emerging.  If authorities look at quelling protest as a question of homeland security, he says, then they will retrace the outlines of a \u201crepressive political script.\u201d  He said his experience in Miami was not a good sign.  There, when protestors demonstrated against the Free Trade Area of the Americas, they were met with a strategy of overwhelming force which Miami\u2019s mayor later described as a \u201cmodel for homeland security.\u201d  Using federal officers and money from the $87 billion appropriated to fight terrorism in Iraq, the security in Miami was clearly based on a philosophy of regarding demonstrators as the enemy.  The incident was surprisingly underreported, but the strategy seems to be favored by the administration\u2014recently the New York Times reported that the FBI is collecting data on American protestors as if they were terrorists.  But unlike Miami, New York can generate hundreds of thousands of protestors, and with those kinds of numbers comes a far greater risk of disaster.  It\u2019s up to \u201cconcerned elected officials,\u201d says Hayden, to \u201cdecide who is in charge of defining the first amendment, the police and FBI or civilian authority.\u201d  For their part, protestors must recognize the politically self-defeating consequences of appearing militant\u2014to oppose, in Hayden\u2019s words, \u201cnot the police but the partisan use of the police\u201d which may emerge. Demonstrators and authorities alike had better recall the refrain of the students chanting in 1968, under the clubs of the Chicago police: \u201cThe whole world is watching.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><i>Peter P.M.

{"title": "The Misunderstanding of the Christ | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Erol N. Gulay", "body": "<p><span>It\u2019s no secret that religions have deep-seated issues with sex and violence. Al-Qaeda extremists killed 3,000 people on Sept. 11 but likely never touched a woman\u2014all, supposedly, in the name of God. Fundamentalist Christians continue to support Bush after he lied to America so he could bomb Iraq; yet, they called for Clinton\u2019s head when he lied about having sex. Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell denounce Islam as a \u201cviolent religion\u201d but then use Old Testament texts to prove that Christianity isn\u2019t necessarily a peaceful one either.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cJust as there are numerous references to peace in the Bible, there are frequent references to God-ordained war\u2026We continue to live in violent times. The Bible tells us war will be a reality until Christ returns,\u201d explains Falwell in a Jan. 30 editorial. Judging by his logic, perhaps the God of the Bible and Allah really are the same thing. At the very least, they are both \u201cpro-war.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Of course, Falwell fails to mention what Jesus might say about war; but, it\u2019s pretty clear he\u2019d be against it\u2014which doesn\u2019t make that bit particularly supportive of his cause. Falwell no doubt liked God better when he was laying down plagues and wiping out whole peoples from the earth. The God that he supposedly follows\u2014the God of love, human fellowship, forgiveness and, to repeat lest we forget again, love\u2014doesn\u2019t fit in well with the Christian Right agenda. Reflexively pro-war and pro-business, the Christians under Falwell, Robertson and, now, Mel Gibson, probably can\u2019t bear to read the New Testament with its constant denunciations of hatred, intolerance and violence. They might as well attend an anti-war rally.</span></p> <p><span>Speaking of Jesus and Gibson, the movie that\u2019s supposed to be about his last hours The Passion of the Christ, has attracted a lot of controversy; but it\u2019s been hailed as if it were the Second Coming by the Christian Right. The movie focuses on the brutality and bloodshed visited upon Jesus, cleverly usurping the message of love and brotherhood, only to replace it with the message of intolerance, sin and violence. Gibson never wants people to forget that we are ultimately responsible for his Lord crucifixion. \u00a0And by \u201cpeople\u201d I mean \u201cthe Jews.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI urge you all to go see it. Sure it\u2019s rated R, but that\u2019s only for the violence. There is no sex in this movie,\u201d televangelist Marcus Lamb assures his Christian audience. Jesus is tortured, flagellated, crucified and killed, but luckily doesn\u2019t try to hook up with Mary Magdalene.</span></p> <p><span>The film, according to Gibson, is painstakingly accurate. Jesus is played by a dark-haired, dark-eyed actor, and the only languages spoken are Aramaic and Latin. However, the film was shot in Italy rather than Israel\u2014a modern-day Jesus riding atop a donkey trying to enter Jerusalem would be held up at a checkpoint and asked for his identity card. And that\u2019s if he could climb over the wall surrounding the city first.</span></p> <p><span>Jesus is shaking his head at all of us. His birthplace is beset with violence, while his so-called followers have the gall to justify war and condemn peace in his name. Meanwhile, an Aussie with an outsized ego and a martyrdom complex hijacks his life story to guilt-trip all of humanity for his death.</span></p> <p><span>Gibson, Falwell and Robertson should be wary of what they wish for. If Jesus does come back, he will likely be wearing a tie-dyed shirt, smoking a joint, flashing the peace sign and rocking rose-tinted glasses. And he would not want to hang out with the prudes of the Christian Coalition.</span></p> <p><span><i>Erol N.

{"title": "Howard Dean, Meet Yellow Journalism | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "J. hale Russell", "body": "<p><span>Members of the mainstream press covering former Vermont Gov. Howard B. Dean\u2019s presidential run apparently didn\u2019t sleep through their high school English classes, where they learned that compelling stories always follow arcs from beginning to climax to denouement. Being good pupils, they constructed a now-familiar narrative around the candidate, first building him into an outsider-turned-frontrunner and then relentlessly tearing him down. The storyline bore little relationship to the facts of the campaign, but after reporters and editors decided that the peak had been reached\u2014roughly ten months before the general election, and before a single vote had been cast in a primary or caucus\u2014they imposed on their audience a diet of character defamation coupled with early pronouncements of death, making Dean into an increasingly difficult choice for voters. More than any other candidate, Dean was made\u2014and unmade\u2014with the pages and cameras of major news outlets. The media did not play fair, and with Dean\u2019s withdrawal last week they finally accomplished their goal.</span></p> <p><span>The concocted narrative could be seen unfolding on the covers of publications like Time and Newsweek, each of which put Dean on the cover twice (by an odd \u201ccoincidence,\u201d on the same week each time). In August, they hailed the coming of an antiwar underdog, and Newsweek set up the central conflict that would dominate mainstream campaign coverage until mid-February with their cover title: \u201cHoward Dean: Destiny or Disaster?\u201d In December, the author of that August story, Jonathan H. Alter \u201979, who is also a Crimson editor, published a remarkably prescient column. Though Dean was on the upswing following an endorsement from Al Gore \u201969, Alter said it was still too early to call him a \u201cshoo-in,\u201d positing two laws: the \u201cLaw of Premature Predictions\u201d and the \u201cLaw of Media Oscillation.\u201d Of the second, he wrote, \u201cThe process invites\u2014no, demands\u2014a series of sine curves to keep everyone interested\u2026The media will half-consciously rearrange all the atoms of emphasis and particles of story choice to make it seem so.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>It should come as no surprise that Alter\u2014a member of the profession that charges itself with implementing this \u201claw of media oscillation\u201d\u2014proved entirely right. Just two issues later, on January 12, Newsweek\u2019s cover showed a glaring Dean with a scare headline: \u201cDoubts About Dean: Behind the Democrats\u2019 Battle to Stop Him.\u201d The story\u2019s opening showed little promise to deliver much substance on that theme\u2014but it revealed plenty about the media\u2019s desire to bring down the outsider from Vermont who had dared breach the establishment\u2019s walls. \u201cThe murmurs of doubt are faint, barely audible above the background hum of the Internet cosmos, but they are worth listening to,\u201d the article began, proceeding to quote a few Dean-doubters posting comments of dubious newsworthiness on the former governor\u2019s public, uncensored weblog. A month later, Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., was fresh off the Iowa victory the media had handed him, and he appeared on Time\u2019s cover with an uncharacteristically flattering photograph that could only be called  \u201cpresidential.\u201d Below it ran a caption that, at least on a grammatical level, asked a question: \u201cWhat Kind of President Would John Kerry Be?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>They never liked Dean, it was clear. Time magazine selected Dean in its final issue of the year for a photoessay of the \u201cPeople Who Mattered 2003\u201d\u2014at first seeming a positive choice, until one noticed that, alone among the dozen or so other entries, Dean\u2019s photo was a blurry gray shot of his back talking to four or five equally blurry members of the press at a blurry location. All the other photos were well-lit images including their subject\u2019s faces\u2014not a bad objective for responsible photojournalism. Two weeks later\u2014the same week as Newsweek\u2019s \u201cDoubts\u201d story\u2014Time ran a blotchy color-by-numbers-style illustration of Dean. Their analysis, as it turned out, was about as rigorous and useful as color by numbers; it was even accompanied by two photos, one glaring, one smiling, with the incisive captions, \u201cAngry Prophet\u201d and \u201cHappy Warrior.\u201d \u201cIt is more complicated at the top of the heap,\u201d they insightfully noted of Dean, who they said was \u201cbeing pummeled from every angle, and his every assertion\u2026examined under a microscope.\u201d But rather than showing how that process was working, their next sentence went ahead and pummeled Dean, repeating as fact a series of stale, illogical campaign-trail critiques.</span></p> <p><span>The media handled those who questioned the balance of their coverage with a pat analysis: Dean brought it all on himself with a single character flaw, his \u201canger.\u201d Never mind that they found exactly zero meaningful examples of Dean\u2019s supposed short fuse\u2014no instances of the doctor having blown up at family or employees in Vermont\u2019s government. Still, the media\u2019s team of pop psychologists had already certified him incurably \u201cangry.\u201d Their distorted case against Dean seemed closed when they seized upon his post-Iowa \u201cscream,\u201d playing it again and again (633 times on broadcast and cable media in a few days, according to the Associated Press, and relentlessly in Diane Sawyer\u2019s half-hour ABC interview of Dean and his wife). But, it turned out, the so-called shout itself wasn\u2019t actually the manic, out-of-the-blue cry of an angry madman\u2014closer inspection revealed the clip to be the product of a bad, misleading recording from a unidirectional microphone.  Moreover, it was obvious in context that Dean\u2019s litany of states was by no standard angry and was hardly out of place in front of a crowd of exhausted, disappointed\u2014but still enthusiastic\u2014volunteers. A few days later, Sawyer quietly admitted that she had by then heard a second recording of the rally at which, she said, \u201cthe so-called scream couldn\u2019t really be heard at all.\u201d CBS, ABC, CNN and even Fox News all admitted to varying degrees that they\u2019d overplayed the clip. But their sheepish statements of regret didn\u2019t approach anywhere near 633 airings. And in the weeks that followed, it was that scream\u2014at last, incontrovertible \u201cevidence\u201d of his \u201canger\u201d\u2014to which pundits pointed in describing his downfall.</span></p> <p><span>Within weeks, reports of Dean\u2019s demise were being greatly exaggerated, or at least greatly rushed. On Feb. 2, right after Iowa, Time wrote, \u201cHoward Dean found himself clawing his way back from his near-death experience\u201d\u2014despite the fact that his brush with \u201cdeath\u201d had consisted of picking up a respectable number of delegates before the polls opened in 49 out of 50 states. Once set in motion, nothing could derail the media\u2019s plotline, which left the doctor no room for resuscitation.</span></p> <p><span>They stamped him \u201cunelectable\u201d\u2014an essentially meaningless adjective in the earliest months of an election year, but a self-fulfilling prophecy when many people believe whatever their TV anchor tells them. In one glaring example of an obituary published before death, the CBS affiliate in Jacksonville, Fla. posted on its website a Knight-Ridder wire story announcing Dean\u2019s Wisconsin loss, comparing his campaign to a \u201cplummeting comet,\u201d at 8:42 in the morning on Feb. 17, just hours after the Wisconsin polls had opened and long before even preliminary results were available. Knight-Ridder is widely regarded as a high-level, professional news organization\u2014the kind where publishing news stories before they happen is generally frowned upon. But its editors evidently didn\u2019t need any precincts to report results in order to know them. The Columbia Journalism Review has documented other glaring errors: on Feb. 17, The New York Times referred to Dean campaign chairman Steven Grossman as having joined Kerry\u2019s campaign\u2014before he had. Moreover, by any count Dean was\u2014and even is today\u2014ahead of Sen. John R. Edwards, D-N.C., in terms of number of convention delegates secured. Edwards, though, an anointed favorite of pundits, was never declared unelectable; by contrast, Dean, whose \u201closs after loss\u201d generally consisted of respectable second- and third-place finishes where he picked up a healthy collection of delegates, was.</span></p> <p><span>Numerous studies by non-partisan media research groups have demonstrated that Dean received a disproportionate share of negative campaign coverage. According to the Center for Media and Public Affairs, he received twice as much coverage as Kerry in 2003. Forty-nine percent of Dean\u2019s mentions were deemed positive, compared to a whopping 78 percent for the other Dems combined. It became even worse on the day of Iowa: before the caucuses, the Center reports that 98 percent of the network evening news coverage of Kerry and Edwards was positive, compared to 58 for Dean. Even more remarkable than the numbers themselves is the rabid ferocity with which the media buried Dean. Sawyer even went after Dean\u2019s wife, repeatedly saying that she could just \u201chear some people out there\u2026saying\u201d (her earpiece must contain a direct feed of the voice of Americans everywhere) that a career woman like Judith Steinberg Dean could not be first lady, and interrogating the couple on how a truly romantic husband could buy his wife rhododendrons for a birthday present. The Deans comported themselves with notable dignity under Sawyer\u2019s vicious, distasteful interrogation. Her vitriol was hardly unique. Even The Weekly Standard\u2019s William Kristol\u2014not known for his liberalism, to say the least\u2014said that \u201cthe media really turned on Dean.\u201d Just last week, longtime political journalist William Greider wrote in The Nation that he had talked to a handful of top campaign reporters who were \u201cchortl[ing] over their accomplishment\u201d in toppling Dean.</span></p> <p><span>Former New York Times reporter Jayson Blair\u2019s fabricated coverage inspired widespread outcry from the public and major restructuring within many newspapers last year. Stephen Glass, whose fabulously creative\u2014albeit false\u2014inventions in The New Republic hardly changed the results of an election, created a frenzy within magazine journalism and had his story turned into a cautionary motion picture this year. Where is the rage at the media players who bypassed the democratic process to willfully eliminate a candidate and manipulate an election with coverage that was often misleading and sometimes downright inaccurate? Many of the nation\u2019s top reporters, editors and publishers are doubtless proud of their remarkable demonstration of the uses and abuses of the fourth estate\u2019s power, but they should be ashamed of themselves. The commercial media\u2019s coverage of Dean was often no more than an irresponsible, unfair, unprofessional sham. Newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst notoriously followed through on a promise to supply the Spanish-American War so his photographers could have a juicy assignment. More than a century later, the media took down Howard Dean. Then they wrote about it.</span></p> <p><span><i>J. Hale Russell \u201905 is an English concentrator in Adams House.

{"title": "The Art of Howard Dean's Fall | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>His story is almost unbelievable, his fall as rapid and unexpected as the meteoric rise that took him from a New England state government to the front pages of magazines and newspapers across the nation. And though former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean dropped out of the race for the White House this week, he differs from many past failed presidential candidates in that his legend will likely live on in American political lore for generations. I, however, will remember Dean for something other than his brief tenure as the frontrunner for the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination. For in one of those delightfully sublime moments in history when life imitates art, Dean has provided us with one of the most picturesque and artistic exits from the American stage in recent memory\u2014with a little help from the Bible, of all places.</span></p> <p><span>It all started when Dean remarked to reporters in early January that Job was his favorite book from the New Testament. Job is a part of the Old Testament, of course; and as if this was not enough, Dean forged on with his obtuse biblical meditations. \u201cI don\u2019t like the way it ends,\u201d he appended, flubbing a few sentences on the authenticity of Job\u2019s ultimate restoration, \u201cwhich we believe was tacked on later.\u201d Dean then left the room but returned about an hour later to admit his mistake while reasserting shrewdly that \u201cit\u2019s such an allegory\u2026It sort of explains that bad things could happen to very good people for no good reason.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>And with these words, as if he had aroused the wrath of God with his inanity, the walls came tumbling down on Dean. He came in third in the Iowa caucus, second in New Hampshire\u2019s primary, and then failed to take first place in any subsequent primary. According to CNN/USA Today/Gallup polls of registered Democrats nationwide, in mid-December he had been leading the nearest Democratic contender by 18 percentage points; by the beginning of February, he was losing to Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., by 38 percentage points. In less than a month, everything that Dean had worked for and accomplished in almost two years on the campaign trail was taken away. Somehow, fantastically, poetically, Dean became the very character he had so fatefully alluded to the month before.</span></p> <p><span>Was Dean guilty of some horrible sin, or was he merely done in by the whims of society? Pundits and pollsters have offered a variety of answers to this question. Some point to the pugnacity of the media or the other Democratic contenders, some fault Dean\u2019s lack of a military background, some excoriate former campaign manager Joe Trippi or endorser Al Gore \u201969, some simply sigh and say \u201cit was never meant to be.\u201d We will never, perhaps, isolate the cause of Dean\u2019s rapid downfall. I submit, however, that we should not keep our minds closed to the possibility of divine intervention.</span></p> <p><span>Was it Job or Dean who howled famously in apparent agony and disbelief at the misfortune that had befallen him? Both men went through shock, anguish and fist-raising before coming to the overwhelming but reluctant conclusion that \u201cthe Lord gave and the Lord has taken away\u201d (Job 1:21)\u2014or, as Dean half-heartedly put it on Wednesday, \u201cWe are leaving one track, but we are going on another track that will take back America...\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Job, like Dean, was a successful, righteous man caught up in a divine joke. In Job\u2019s case, God had abruptly taken his fortune, his family and his health. While Job\u2019s friends insisted that he must have done something to anger the deity, the truth is that there was nothing. God was acting arbitrarily, for a few celestial pennies in a trivial bet with Satan.</span></p> <p><span>Dean\u2019s fate was similarly meaningless. There are no principles of politics to be deduced from his experience except that nothing is sure. Of course, political analysts and consultants will forever try to draw lessons from Dean\u2019s campaign, warning future candidates not to be too angry, not to put all their eggs in the anti-war basket, not to be endorsed by the establishment too early, not to squander funds. But we should remember that these are the same analysts who just a few months ago anointed Dean the Democratic nominee, lauding his fiery rhetoric, his outsider status and his groundbreaking efforts at high-tech political mobilization. In the end, Dean\u2019s flaws were as ineffable and varied as his virtues.  Dean, like all good art, may ultimately have danced on the American stage for no real practical purpose at all.</span></p> <p><span>As Dean suggested, there was a happy ending to the story of Job: His fortune and family was returned to him and he lived to the ripe old age of 140. But for Dean, who appropriately noticed that the resolution of Job\u2019s story was inconsistent with reality, there will likely be no happy ending inserted. Rather, he will live out the version of the story that he claimed to prefer: Dean, like the old soldier that he is not, will simply fade away. Just as Job had expected to, Dean will march off \u201cto the land of deepest night, of deep shadow and disorder, where even the light is like darkness\u201d (Job 10: 21-22). In other words, he will return to Vermont and resume the mundane existence that had been so suddenly and deliberately interrupted by this mean cosmic joke.</span></p> <p><span><i>Jorian P.

Kucinich, D-Ohio, discussed the need for global cooperation and answered wide-ranging questions from hundreds of mostly elderly supporters at Harvard Law School (HLS) yesterday.</span></p> <p><span>The talk, sponsored by the HLS Democrats, was entitled \u201cThe Truth about Iraq.\u201d Kucinich said that the concept of preemptive war was illegitimate and would actually result in increased danger to U.S. citizens.</span></p> <p><span>Despite the speech being advertised as talk about Iraq, Kucinich opted to use the majority of his prepared time to extol upon the unified, peaceful world toward which he would strive if elected president.</span></p> <p><span>Event organizer and HLS Democrats Vice President Ariel A. Neuman said that the topics covered by Kucinich were appropriate.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe congressman had some issues he thought were important to the campaign, and those were the issues he chose to talk about,\u201d said Neuman, a second-year law student.</span></p> <p><span>Kucinich said that the United States is presently attempting to place itself above the global community, but that we should instead be equal partners in the world. To achieve that goal, he said, the United States needs to work with others to protect the environment and reduce nuclear proliferation. He called for the reinstatement of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, the halt of funding for nuclear weapons and the end of the U.S. space weapons development program.</span></p> <p><span>Kucinich also criticized what he said was a culture of war in America.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWar has infected our words, our thoughts, our deeds and our domestic and international actions,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>To help change this tone, Kucinich said he would create a Department of Peace that would reach out to other nations to achieve worldwide goodwill\u2014a proposal he sponsored in the House of Representatives in the summer of 2001.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe can expand the power of the human heart far beyond where anyone ever thought it could go. That\u2019s where I want to lead,\u201d he said, after which the audience responded with a standing ovation.</span></p> <p><span>Kucinich also said Americans should aim for peace at home by cutting down on crime and inequality before engaging in conflicts abroad.</span></p> <p><span>After his initial remarks, Kucinich took questions from the audience about his presidential run and both foreign and domestic policies.</span></p> <p><span>When asked about joining Ralph Nader on a presidential ticket, Kucinich responded that he did not foresee such a union.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cLet me make something absolutely clear,\u201d Kucinich said. \u201cMy nomination will make Ralph Nader\u2019s candidacy much less necessary.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Kucinich spoke about Iraq when asked about his ideas by audience members. He said that the United States should turn over control of the rebuilding process to the United Nations.</span></p> <p><span>He added that the nation needs to fund the U.N. peacekeeping effort and completely pay for the reconstruction of Iraq\u2019s infrastructure and for reparations to those Iraqis that lost family members in the war.</span></p> <p><span>He did, however, criticize the United Nations\u2014and the Bush administration\u2014for not taking a more active stance on the current crisis in Haiti.</span></p> <p><span>Domestically, Kucinich said that Republicans could be inflating the national deficit so that they have an excuse to cut social programs.</span></p> <p><span>Kucinich, who called for the resignation of Fed Chair Alan Greenspan earlier yesterday, emphasized the importance of social programs in the United States. Kucinich took issue with Greenspan\u2019s  recommendation to cut Social Security benefits, made at a hearing before the House Budget Committee yesterday, and blamed the Fed chair for not opposing White House fiscal policy.</span></p> <p><span>In his speech, Kucinich said the United States needed more social services, not fewer.</span></p> <p><span>He advocated for universal health and child care, tuition-free college education and the creation of a government job programs similar to those created during the Great Depression.</span></p> <p><span>Kucinich said he would fund these programs by eliminating tax cuts for the wealthy.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Alan J.

{"title": "Mastering the Split Screen | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>In October 2003, The New York Times website added a section to its op-ed page featuring editorials from foreign newspapers, particularly those that that deal with American foreign policy.  CNN now regularly runs translated clips from the Arab satellite channel al Jazeera. These quiet additions are, in fact, part of a fundamental shift in the way we get information. Thanks to the internet and satellite TV, mass media are no longer geographically limited.  Propaganda is propagated beyond national borders on signals that don\u2019t fade as the metropole fades into the distance.  We\u2019re all watching each other\u2014and watching the others watch us\u2014in a way that simply would not have been possible only a few years ago.</span></p> <p><span>Still, the last decades\u2019 technological shifts haven\u2019t quite produced a harmonious global village. The ancient Greeks branded as \u201cbarbarians\u201d those whose languages sounded to them like \u201cbar bar bar\u201d gibberish, and to many Westerners, foreign scripts still seem to conceal nasty secrets, and spoken gutturals and trills provoke suspicion. In this environment of information whose instant availability is not matched by intelligibility, translators have become some of the most powerful people in our societies, seeming to carry news of secrets being told behind our backs. The more individual streams of information one can understand, the better: The privileged one is not the broadcaster who beams one image outwards to the world, but the all-knowing guard, sitting in front of a closed-circuit TV whose screen flashes 10 images at once.</span></p> <p><span>Al Jazeera has been the master of this split-screen approach for years, but the United States is just now catching up to the rest of the world. Thanks to aggressive British colonialism during the past two centuries, much of the post-colonial world is multilingual\u2014following U.S. news, watching President Bush\u2019s speeches and developing first-hand opinions about America.  Much of America, however, remains proudly English-only, especially proud of exporting its media along with its Coca-Cola.  We often forget that the world is getting our message all too well\u2014and analyzing it while we sit mesmerized by flashy graphics on Fox News, oblivious to what they have to say. As we begin the twenty-first century we are leaving the era of military omnipotence and entering into the age of journalistic omniscience.</span></p> <p><span>This is not to say that no one in America is aware of the importance of keeping an eye on the rest of the world\u2019s thoughts. In liberal circles, \u201cmultinarrativism\u201d is as hip as multiculturalism\u2014but with it comes the same danger that individual identity will be subsumed by generalized, catch-all groupings. Multinarrativism can mean that we listen to stories from Mexico and Jordan and India only to interpret them as national opinions, ignoring the unique voice of the writer.  Those who watch al Jazeera know all too well that an isolated clip from CNN can represent\u2014or misrepresent\u2014\u201cAmerica.\u201d And just the same, when an op-ed from Beijing comes to represent China or the Lebanon-based Daily Star equals that entire country, we run the risk of ignoring individual voices and dissenting opinions.  When we identify opinions by country alone, we raise up the nation-state above all else and ignore the fact that the writer\u2019s most salient attribute might not be \u201cMalaysian\u201d or \u201cCanadian\u201d but rather \u201cwoman\u201d or \u201cworker\u201d or \u201cFrench-speaking\u201d or \u201cconservative.\u201d  In a world reassessing the role and significance of the modern nation-state, we need to be more careful about our categories.  Quick glances across oceans might give us a sense of worldliness, but our newspapers and television stations run the risk of obscuring the very thing they seek to understand.</span></p> <p><span>It\u2019s time for us to embrace the split screen and open our eyes to the stories that aren\u2019t our own.   This is the only way to compete in the world of cable and cable modems.  But if we flip channels too fast, we\u2019ll forget that each picture is in fact a moving image, internally dynamic and colorful. Each of us should take a trip to Out of Town News, one of the oldest and dearest institutions in the Square, look at the pictures in a variety of papers, dredge up the languages we took in high school and then forgot, and\u2014with more than just a superficial glance\u2014begin to make sense of the multivocal multitude of information flowing around our globe.</span></p> <p><span><i>Liora R.

{"title": "Brian Palmer's Academy | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>I must confess that I was originally going to fashion this column rather polemically. Someone like Lecturer on the Study of Religion Brian C.W. Palmer \u201986, I had envisioned writing, deserves fame like the Chicago Seven do. Not in the way of a celebrated academic, but in the style of a disenchanted voice shouting against the powers that be\u2014which, from the ivory tower, Palmer has done frequently in any case.</span></p> <p><span>His class, Religion 1529, \u201cPersonal Choice and Global Transformation,\u201d Harvard\u2019s second largest this semester after Ec 10, is taught almost entirely by Palmer-selected guest lecturers, who are questioned by the audience (that is, the students) on any number of different issues du jour that concern the overly-broad course topic.</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps Palmer has managed to attract so many students with his siren\u2019s song because he is constantly so elated to see his students\u2014all 584 of them. He can be spotted in Harvard dining halls more often than any other faculty member (probably including House Masters), includes his home phone number in his frequent class-wide e-mails and is a genial guy to even his critics. After all, it\u2019s hard not to be inspired by Palmer\u2014not after you hear his wavering voice, with its tinges of legitimate conviction not found in so many Harvard faculty members.</span></p> <p><span>More than even his celebrity, though, it\u2019s extremely hard to author a critical column because everything that one could accuse Brian Palmer of with a sense of outrage has been appropriated by Palmerites in their defense.</span></p> <p><span>I might say, for instance, that Brian Palmer plays fast and loose with academics, that his class is bent more around liberal ideology than scholarly pursuits. To which, he and his supporters chime in, \u201cyou bet.\u201d At every Palmer event I\u2019ve attended (about five), he references a New York Times article which labels his class, appropriately, \u201cIdealism 101\u201d and distributes a Christian Science Monitor expose that depicts him as a liberal ideologue in and outside the classroom. He was a featured speaker at Harvard\u2019s large anti-war walkout last year, and at every opportunity he gets (from serving as the emcee of an a cappella concert to chatting with students he meets in the Yard), he lets loose his wry sense of humor against the usual targets: George Bush, John Ashcroft, Don Rumsfeld and the boys.</span></p> <p><span>Or I might accuse his class of being an opportunity for an \u201ceasy A\u201d\u2014indeed, it\u2019s probably the easiest in the college. Weekly reading averages a couple dozen pages. Students are required to write a 150-word paragraph about what they thought (and, potently, felt) of each celebrity lecturer that comes to speak to Religion 1529. It doesn\u2019t have a midterm; its final is take-home. Indeed, Palmer himself admitted of his offering last spring, \u201csome students take the class because it\u2019s easy.\u201d Against this <i>j\u2019accuse</i> of academic ease, what one would think would be a grave charge at Harvard, I have not a few times been stopped mid-way through my litany by friends thanking me for a \u201cgut\u201d course recommendation.</span></p> <p><span>Or, I could point to the astounding similarities between Religion 1528, \u201cGlobalization and Human Values,\u201d which Palmer taught last year, and Religion 1529, \u201cPersonal Choice and Global Transformation,\u201d this year\u2019s version, and furrow my brow. If the titles don\u2019t have enough pangs of similarity, then the content certainly does: Many of the same lecturers are on both syllabi, and if compared to one another without reference to the course title, the course descriptions\u2014 an informal poll of my friends revealed\u2014are virtually interchangeable.</span></p> <p><span>It\u2019s also easy to criticize his guest lecturers, homogeneously left-wing types who have become the hallmark of Palmer\u2019s classes. In 1529, he labels them \u201crelevant practitioners\u201d of personal choice. One is Noam Chomsky, on both the Religion 1528 and 1529 syllabi, who will (shockingly) not be speaking about linguistics, in which he holds his PhD. Palmer also selected Howard D. Zinn as a lecturer, whose <i>People\u2019s History of the United States</i> takes great care to omit any modicum of praise for Western civilization, when one might choose from the wealth of legit Harvard historians. The list really goes on and on: Robert Reich, Swanee Hunt, Peter Singer and many other more marginal leftists find their way onto the syllabus. Last year, even Adam Yauch of the Beastie Boys spoke in Palmer\u2019s class\u2014a \u201crelevant practitioner\u201d of human values, perchance?</span></p> <p><span>So, where\u2019s the outrage? Am I really the only one perturbed that Palmer is allowed to teach a class like this? The Undergraduate Council clearly doesn\u2019t agree with me \u2014 that body awarded the lecturer the Levenson Memorial Teaching Prize in 2002. Even expected outlets of discontent don\u2019t pipe up. The Harvard Republican Club? Not a word. The ever-standoffish University President Lawrence H. Summers? Nothing\u2014in fact, he\u2019s a guest lecturer, probably the most conservative on the docket.</span></p> <p><span>I can only hope this kind of critical dialogue is going on behind closed doors. Until then, solace can be had by realizing that Palmer\u2019s departure from Harvard is nigh, and there\u2019s little use raving against a person who\u2019s on his way out thanks to a short-term lecturership contract. But students should nonetheless realize that despite the allure of idealism in measured tones, there should be no mistaking the syndrome which has made Palmer\u2019s classes so acclaimed: Liberal students rush to Palmer\u2019s class for an eloquent affirmation of an already-established world-view, plus an easy A.</span></p> <p><span><i>Travis R.

{"title": "Beware Shrum Populism | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>In 1988, former Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis asked voters whether they wanted \u201ca president who fights for the privileged few, or a president who fights for you.\u201d In 2000, Al Gore \u201969 argued that while Republicans fought for \u201cbig HMOs, big oil [and] the big insurance companies,\u201d he was \u201cfighting for the people.\u201d And this year, Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., very originally declared that his \u201ccampaign is about fighting big oil, fighting big HMOs and insurance companies and special interests.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The pattern has not been missed: labeling the liberals\u2019 case against President Bush, editorial writers and commentators from across the punditocracy have stamped the epithet \u201cpopulist\u201d across the forehead of nearly every Democratic candidate. In the Washington Post last month, David S. Broder called former Vermont Governor Howard Dean\u2019s fundraising appeals \u201cinternet-based populism.\u201d In The New York Times the same day, Robin Toner mused about whether Americans can accept a \u201cpopulist uprising\u201d at a time of economic recovery. On CNN, Robert Novak questioned what he called the \u201cus-versus-them, populist rhetoric\u201d of Sen. John R. Edwards, D-N.C. But since Che Guevara isn\u2019t on the ballot and the most radical redistribution proposed is a return to Bill Clinton\u2019s tax code, incisive readers might wonder: Where is the populism?</span></p> <p><span>At least as the commentators define it, it is in the tone, in the constantly repeated conviction that to give to us (the aggrieved voters), one must take from them (the faceless, selfish plutocrats). To varying degrees, Kerry, Edwards, Rep. Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo., and nearly every other significant Democrat have condemned Bush around that theme: that he is captive to \u201cbig\u201d corporate interests in Washington, stacking the decks against ordinary Americans, who need a \u201cfighter\u201d to beat up the bad guys.</span></p> <p><span>Coincidentally, they who share a message also share a political consultant, and his name is Robert M. Shrum. He is the most powerful, most influential voice inside Democratic politics\u2014and with the (big) exception of Clinton\u2019s presidential campaigns, has almost exclusively written the national Democratic script for two decades.</span></p> <p><span>Shrum carries a colorful political history: A Harvard Law School graduate, he was principal speechwriter to former South Dakota Sen. George S. McGovern in his 1972 presidential run. Fired after 10 days on the only successful presidential campaign for which he has ever worked (Jimmy Carter\u2019s in 1976), Shrum trashed the candidate on his way out. After finding a permanent home as the top wordsmith for Sen. Edward M. Kennedy \u201954-\u201956, D-Mass., Shrum opened a wildly lucrative political consulting shop noted more for its consistency than its batting average.</span></p> <p><span>A Shrum campaign occasionally offers Kennedy-esque imagery (Kerry\u2019s \u201cwe need to go to the moon here on Earth\u201d), often involves unsubtle negativity (Gore\u2019s 2000 ads featuring pollution almost emanating from Bush\u2019s head), but always\u2014always\u2014delivers some variant of the \u201cfighter\u201d message. Call it repetitive, brilliant, leftist or anything else\u2014but realize that Shrum\u2019s narrative has never won a presidential election. This is not to say that populism is a mistake; <i>Shrum</i> populism is a mistake.</span></p> <p><span>Shrum Populism is dramatically different from the populism that wins. Yes, Jimmy Carter ran against \u201centrenched Washington insiders,\u201d Ronald Reagan used non-existent \u201cwelfare queens\u201d to symbolize government excess and Bill Clinton attacked \u201cbrain-dead politicians.\u201d But that wasn\u2019t who they were. They were Common-Man Populists\u2014Carter on his peanut farm, Reagan at his Santa Barbara ranch, Clinton from small-town Arkansas. They were guys you would enjoy inviting over for a beer, and who seemed to respect middle class, middle-American moms and dads, working hard and wanting the best for their country.</span></p> <p><span>Chris Matthews, the MSNBC commentator, likes to say that the Americans vote for the presidential candidate with \u201cthe sun on his face.\u201d The Common-Man Populists are optimists. Carter, Reagan, Clinton\u2014they understood something that Shrum never will: Americans are aspirational, not punitive. To defeat the last Republican president running for re-election, Bill Clinton said, \u201cAll of us\u2014we need each other. When George Bush fails to invest in our people, what he doesn\u2019t understand is that, in America, we don\u2019t have a person to waste.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>When Shrum advises his candidates to attack the top 1 percent, he neglects that (according to USA Today\u2019s polls) 20 percent of Americans believe that they\u2019re already among the wealthiest 1 percent, and 50 percent believe they will reach the highest 1 percent in their lifetimes. When Shrum advises his candidates to condemn corporations, he ignores that (according to the Survey of Consumer Finances) nearly half of all Americans own some form of stock\u2014and want American companies to succeed. And when Shrum advises his candidates to call President Bush a tool of selfish special interests, he lets the president too far off the hook. Bush is responsible for foreign policy lies, for the biggest deficits ever, for millions of jobs lost\u2014his special interest supporters aren\u2019t.</span></p> <p><span>Americans are inclusive and interdependent, positive and optimistic. John F. Kennedy \u201940 (a Crimson editor) beats Richard M. Nixon. Equal opportunity beats targeted resentment. And the candidate with the sun on his face will beat the candidate with Bob Shrum in his ear.</span></p> <p><span><i>Brian M. Goldsmith \u201905 is a government concentrator in Lowell House.

Adam P.

Truesdell \u201906, who cited a conflict between states\u2019 rights on the one hand, and conservative social values, on the other.</span></p> <p><span>She said the issue would not affect HRC\u2019s support for the president.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIn the campaign, we\u2019re going to focus on issues that unite us, not those that divide us,\u201d she said.</span></p> <p><span>Mansfield said that this issue would be overshadowed by Iraq in the upcoming election, but speculated that it might have some marginal benefit for the Republican party.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt seems to show that the Democrats or liberals are unwilling to seek their goals through elections and legislatures, and try to do so either by wrenching the law or violating it,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>For their part, the College Dems and the BGLTSA said they would be carefully watching how the issue develops.

{"title": "The Regressive Progressive | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>After accomplishing the Herculean task of losing a single presidential election twice\u2014obtaining a distant third for himself while stealing enough Democratic votes to let a victory slip through that party\u2019s fingers\u2014where did Ralph Nader go? You probably remember how he rebounded and became a national progressive icon, giving rousing speeches on changing our country. Or in Nov. 2000, you might remember Nader coming to Gore\u2019s support in an election that was visibly unfair and deserved a recount to prevent disenfranchisement. And after Bush\u2019s inauguration, remember how Nader used the web and alternative media to publish scathing criticisms of Washington politicians?</span></p> <p><span>If you, like me, don\u2019t remember Nader doing any of this, it\u2019s because he didn\u2019t. Even if mainstream media resisted giving Nader airtime, in the age of weblogs and interactive online media there\u2019s no excuse for silence. But since Nov. 2000, Nader\u2019s website has only added a handful of items on a very limited set of issues. Now that Nader has suddenly reappeared, however, it\u2019s evident that he wasn\u2019t being held captive somewhere\u2014he was choosing to be useless.</span></p> <p><span>There are plenty of popular, legitimate criticisms of Nader: he handed the White House to Bush; he might do that again this year; he\u2019s beginning a campaign of and for the people while the people clearly don\u2019t want him to run; and his website is outdated, lacking the blog or discussion area that has become a staple of modern-day candidates (even of Bush-Cheney). If there\u2019s still a progressive spark lurking within Nader, it\u2019s become increasingly difficult to locate.</span></p> <p><span>But the real lie behind Nader is evidenced by, of all people, Gore and former Vermont Gov. Howard B. Dean. Both are ostensibly far less progressive than Nader\u2014yet recently both have shown a more sincere, more engaged commitment to the left than the Nader of today. After 2000, Gore re-energized and affiliated with the highly progressive MoveOn.org, giving laudable, widely-reported speeches against Bush and the Iraq war. He also threw his support behind Dean when the rest of the Democrats were afraid that endorsing such an outsider would ruin their political careers.</span></p> <p><span>In the 2000 election, Nader undeniably moved Gore\u2019s rhetoric to the left (remember Gore\u2019s excited, populist-sounding convention speech?), something Nader told us was a unique advantage of running as a third-party challenger. But this year Dean\u2014running as a Democrat\u2014moved an entire field of candidates to the left, as Kerry and others struggled to bring their rhetoric in line to compete. Nader, evidently, was wrong: real change can come from within.</span></p> <p><span>Moreover, Dean\u2019s behavior after ending his run for office exhibits the opposite of Nader\u2019s shameful post-2000 disappearance. Dean continues to push his causes, from a weblog updated regularly even post-campaign, to a massive effort to encourage progressives to run in local elections, to a promise to attend the convention and influence the Democratic platform. There\u2019s even talk of Dean starting a Political Action Committee to use his formidable fundraising skills to push Democrats back left.</span></p> <p><span>If Nader were the progressive he claims to be, he\u2019d lose the self-righteousness and take a lesson from Dean and Gore: Instead of glorifying yourself, start blogging and agitate for real, pragmatic progressive change.</span></p> <p><span><i>J.

{"title": "Haiti Betrayed | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>History has a way of repeating itself. On Sunday, Jean Bertrand Aristide, the democratically elected president of Haiti, was deposed in the second coup of his political career. The future appears bleak. Despite Colin Powell\u2019s assurance that they \u201cwant to put down their arms,\u201d the rebels\u2014led by death-squad veterans and former members of the brutal military government that ruled Haiti from 1991 to 1994\u2014have yet to disarm. What brought Haiti to this tragic pass? Rep. Charlie Rangel (D-NY) put the matter bluntly, asserting the Bush Administration was \u201cjust as much a part of this coup d\u2019etat as the rebels, as the looters, or anyone else.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>After fighting a massive war to topple a dictator half way around the world, the Administration proved unwilling to defend a fragile democracy in its own backyard. It would hardly have required a massive military undertaking\u2014as Rangel explained, \u201cAll we had to do was to send 200, 300 troops over there and tell those people to put down the arms.\u201d The Administration\u2019s inaction is already breeding considerable cynicism. \u201cThe problem for Haiti is that it\u2019s not oil-rich,\u201d said Rep. Kendrick Meek (D-FL).</span></p> <p><span>But this is more than just a case of inaction. Rather, the United States\u2019 refusal to provide a security force reflected a calculated ploy to remove Aristide from office. Indeed, over the course of last week the Administration adopted an overtly antagonistic stance toward Aristide, even going so far as to issue a statement blaming him for the turmoil. There is also clear evidence that the many of the rebel leaders have in the past received CIA assistance and U.S. military training.</span></p> <p><span>The most sensational-\u2014if as yet unconfirmed\u2014accusation have come from Aristide himself, who claims that he did not leave Haiti voluntarily but was abducted by armed U.S. forces. This charge has been categorically denied by the Administration.</span></p> <p><span>But the troubled relationship between the U.S. and Aristide goes back to well before the most recent spate of political violence. Aristide\u2014a former priest who preaches a brand leftist populism\u2014has long been a whipping boy for conservatives both here, and in his own country.  He was deposed by a military coup in 1991, only months after his first election. The brutal regime that followed was characterized by egregious human rights violations. In 1994, Aristide was reinstated with the backing of the Clinton Administration.</span></p> <p><span>But leading a nation like Haiti is no easy matter. The small Caribbean nation ranks first in the western hemisphere in measures of poverty, HIV/AIDS prevalence, and malnourishment. Tragically, the Bush Administration\u2019s policies toward Haiti have only  exacerbated these problems.  In 2001, in a thinly veiled attempt to undermine the Aristide government, Bush cut off all U.S. foreign aid to Haiti and prevailed upon the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Bank and the IMF to freeze loans to the Aristide government.</span></p> <p><span>If a growing number of ordinary Haitians had become disenchanted with Aristide in recent months, it was largely because Aristide\u2019s hadn\u2019t delivered on his promises of poverty alleviation\u2014promises he couldn\u2019t keep thanks to the Bush Administration\u2019s shameful foreign aid embargo.</span></p> <p><span>The administration has justified this policy by citing a controversial 2000 election (don\u2019t you think they\u2019d be sympathetic?). In May of 2000, eight Senate candidates-\u2014seven of whom were members of Aristide\u2019s Lavalas party\u2014were seated after having only won pluralities, rather than the required majorities. Objective observers still called the elections a success, but the anti-Aristide opposition declared that they would boycott the presidential election that November. After winning by a landslide, and eager to remove any hint of impropriety, Aristide unseated the seven Lavalas senators who had assumed power in the contentious May elections. But the U.S. continued to side with the opposition, who unconditionally demanded that Aristide leave office before he completed his term in 2005. Aristide offered to hold an early round of presidential elections, but the U.S. refused to monitor them, citing security concerns. Aristide was caught in a catch-22: he couldn\u2019t rebuild the police force without first receiving the foreign aid that would be disbursed only after he had improved security.</span></p> <p><span>Aristide is certainly no saint. Unable to afford a real security force, he gave too long a leash to the armed \u2018thugs\u2019 who acted in his name. And there is reason to suspect that his government has violated civil liberties and perhaps engaged in some minor corruption. But these oft-voiced criticisms miss the point. Aristide was Haiti\u2019s first democratically elected president, and the U.S. is now complicit in his overthrow by a motley rebel force led by documented human rights abusers.</span></p> <p><span>The U.S. should unfreeze $500 million in stalled foreign aid.  But not before it does the right thing by democracy, and acts to restore President Aristide to power.</span></p> <p><span><i>Sasha Post \u201805 is a social studies concentrator in Adams House.

Like so many history Ph.D.s, Erdmann failed in his search for an academic job. Not one to dwell in the past, Erdmann decided to experience first-hand the sorts of transitions he had studied. He made plans to fly to Kosovo.</span></p> <p><span>The decision to move from Cambridge to a recent war zone wasn\u2019t without foundation.

I try. It\u2019s like a test for myself. Can I remember what I did the day before? I eventually can, but it takes effort.\u00a0That\u2019s not a good situation.

B4B chapters are springing up all around the country, the newest one dropping anchor here at Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>B4B is a growing, nonprofit, \u201cnonpartisan\u201d network of activists and artists whose goal is to challenge President Bush\u2019s administration and expose its failed policies through witty and strategic media and theater campaigns. Launched during the 2000 presidential campaign as \u201cBillionaires for Bush or Gore,\u201d it uses a wily combination of satire and facts to communicate through grass-roots organizations and the Internet. The campaign aims to alert the public to the fact that Bush is, in fact, not the ordinary, down-to-earth guy he purports to be. Instead, they claim, he is a power-hungry, lobbyist-pleasing politician. Their intriguing tactics are reminiscent of Jonathan Swift. By pushing for the deregulation of elections, defending big business and encouraging wealthy individuals to manipulate government policy through generous campaign contributions, Billionaires for Bush makes a strong, potently ironic case against Bush as he attempts reelection.</span></p> <p><span>\u201c[B4B] is a grassroots political action committee advocating for the rights and interests of people of phenomenal wealth.

Skomarovsky or \u201cSeymour Benjamins,\u201d as he is known to his brethren, is the co-chair of the national organization. He continues, \u201cWe go to town hall events with Republican officials and make sure our interests are given priority over the unwashed masses that also voted for Bush.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>B4B, despite its exclusivity, only requires a few things from its members. First, it requires that they choose names for themselves that reflect the true spirit of the club (e.g. Dee Regulation, Ivana Censorhugh, Lou Pole), dress the part (cummerbunds for gentlemen, tiaras for women) and, of course, adopt a \u201cbillionaire persona.\u201d Entourages are encouraged. Finally, perhaps the most important caveat of B4B is that its members be nonpartisan\u2014they are not allowed to support a candidate or advocate or dissuade a voter from voting for a candidate. Ingrid Schorr (a.k.a. \u201cMaura B. Formi,\u201d the \u2018B\u2019 standing for \u2018Bucks\u2019), a non-resident tutor in Adams House, joined because \u201cit combines dress-up and political theatre.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Dressed up and in character, B4Bs attend Republican fundraisers and applaud Bush\u2019s wealthy donors. At town hall events, they stand beside Republican officials to make sure their interests are given priority over other Republicans. At leftist protests they can be heard loudly advocating, \u201cFour more wars! Tax work, not wealth!\u201d Harvard\u2019s own chapter, which currently enjoys a membership of 40 and continues to grow, has plans for elaborate dinners in campus dining halls and lavish downtown soirees. Regardless of the pursuit, Billionaires for Bush relishes making a scene.</span></p> <p><span>When B4Bs traveled to New York two weeks ago to \u201cwelcome\u201d Karl Rove to a high-priced, $2000-per-plate Bush fundraiser, they came face-to-face with the people who raised $100,000 or more for the president\u2019s reelection campaign, known as \u201cmavericks.\u201d \u201cMost [mavericks] were visibly uncomfortable having their heavy financing of the Bush campaign draw so much attention,\u201d Skomarovsky says. However, he adds that a few \u201cordinary\u201d Bush supporters smiled, amused, as B4B members chanted \u201cWrite big checks!\u201d from across the street.</span></p> <p><span>Such reactions are fairly commonplace. \u201cYou dumb block of unworthy chimp vomit,\u201d Skomarovsky reads from a letter received by B4B. \u201cI haven\u2019t a clue how one human nor a collective group of humans could be so outlandishly fucking filthy.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Ultimately, Skomarovsky says that he joined because \u201cfour more years of Bush is damn good for [his] bottom line.\u201d On a more serious note, though, he views the organization as a stern critique of American democracy in its current form. \u201cOur brand of democracy serves primarily the wealth and corporate interests that wield outrageous influence through campaign contributions and lobbying,\u201d Skomarovsky says. \u201c[B4B is] a creative and immensely fun way to challenge the Bush administration without having to knock on doors pretending the prevailing democrat is the best thing since sliced bread.\u201d</span></p>"}

Watkins says the quality of education at HBS is on the decline due in part to University President Lawrence H. Summers\u2019 increased meddling in the school\u2019s promotion process.</span></p> <p><span>According to a Mass. Hall spokesperson, a 2002 vote by the Harvard Corporation and the Board of Overseers gave Summers veto power over promotions at all of the University\u2019s schools, including HBS.</span></p> <p><span>The boards instructed Summers to use \u201csome variation of the so-called ad hoc system,\u201d in which academics from outside HBS advise the president on promotions, the spokesperson says.</span></p> <p><span>Watkins, who failed to secure a tenured professorship last fall, says the outsiders largely ignore the field-based case studies that lie at the heart of the school\u2019s innovative teaching method.</span></p> <p><span>These field-based studies form the core of HBS\u2019s case method system, which uses real-life examples to spur classroom discussion on management issues.</span></p> <p><span>Field-based studies offer immeasurable advantages over library-centered cases, says Shad Professor of Business Ethics Joseph L. Badaracco Jr.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s the difference between getting inside an organization using your judgement over reading something that\u2019s been filtered through the eyes of journalists,\u201d says Badaracco, who is also Currier House Master.</span></p> <p><span>But Watkins claims the incentives otivating HBS junior faculty to engage in course development\u2014especially labor-intensive field-based studies\u2014are evaporating now that academics from outside the school hold sway over the promotion process.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cNow place yourself in the position of a young tenure track faculty member at HBS,\u201d Watkins says. \u201cAs a rational actor playing a high stakes game, how would you respond to a realization that the rules of the game have changed?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Watkins says on his weblog that junior faculty are focusing on writing for prestigious peer-reviewed publications instead of developing the field-based cases \u201cthat outside scholars view as something lower than the lowest-class journal articles.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But James E. Aisner \u201968, director of media relations at HBS, says teaching and course development, including field-based work, still figure prominently in the promotion process.</span></p> <p><span>He says that much of the promotion review process still occurs inside HBS, with the school\u2019s entire senior faculty weighing in before Dean Kim B. Clark \u201974 issues a recommendation to Summers.</span></p> <p><span><b>Fuzzy Math</b></span></p> <p><span>Watkins\u2019 weblog highlights statistics indicating that junior faculty are devoting less time to field-based studies and more effort to the academic research likely to impress outside experts.</span></p> <p><span>The shift \u201csounds the death knell for [the school\u2019s] delicate experiment in bridging theory and practice,\u201d Watkins says.</span></p> <p><span>But HBS officials strongly reject Watkins\u2019 argument that the school\u2019s junior faculty have shirked their course development duties.</span></p> <p><span>HBS\u2019s own analysis, according to Aisner, casts doubt on the data Watkins uses to bolster his arguments.</span></p> <p><span>Watkins writes in an e-mail that field-based studies accounted for 74 percent of all HBS cases two years ago\u2014but only 57 percent of cases developed in recent months. Instead, he says, an increasing percentage of new cases come from less labor-intensive library research.</span></p> <p><span>But a study by Michael J. Roberts \u201979, the executive director for case development at HBS, reveals that the percentage of field-based cases has remained constant at roughly 73 percent for the last decade.</span></p> <p><span>Watkins uses data directly from the HBS website, which displays cases that are for sale to other business schools.</span></p> <p><span>The school keeps some of its most recent field-based cases off the market until they have been test-run through HBS classrooms, so online data from recent months show artificially low numbers of field-based cases, Aisner says.</span></p> <p><span>Badaracco says he has seen no decline in the development of field-based cases at HBS in recent years.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf I look at my colleagues, they\u2019re running around writing tons of field- based studies,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span><b>Breaking Convention</b></span></p> <p><span>Though Watkins is a specialist on diplomacy, fellow HBS faculty say he is burning bridges at the school that has employed him since 1996.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis may well cost me some future options, but I\u2019m willing to take that risk,\u201d Watkins says. \u201cSomeone has to be willing to do it.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Junior faculty at HBS declined to speak on the record with The Crimson.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe fact that untenured faculty are so reluctant to talk is, I think, significant in its own right,\u201d Watkins says. \u201cEven if they are denied tenure, they are dependent on recommendations and other good offices from faculty at HBS to secure another position, \u201d</span></p> <p><span>But assistant and associate professors who spoke to The Crimson on background say they are dubious of Watkins\u2019 conclusions.</span></p> <p><span>One junior faculty member says his field-based course development work will significantly strengthen his prospects for promotion when he is considered for an associate professorship this summer.</span></p> <p><span>Docking junior faculty who focus on case studies, he says, \u201cwould be like the Red Sox penalizing people for getting hits.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Another junior faculty member says his course development work helped him win a promotion to an associate professorship. The same professor says he has since focused less attention on case studies\u2014a factor he says could, if anything, work against him in his bid for a tenured position.</span></p> <p><span>But one junior faculty member notes that few business schools other than HBS consider case work to be a critical factor in tenure decisions.

Archival reconstruction and international police cooperation have managed to return many of the pieces stolen from the Baghdad Museum, but the harm done to these archaeological sites is irrevocable.  While U.S. damage control might again succeed in the apprehension of many of the stolen objects, their context and provenance are forever lost, severely curtailing the wealth of information professional archaeologists might have otherwise reaped.</span></p> <p><span>The destruction of cultural capital in the name of war is, of course, nothing new.  In perhaps the most famous example, a Venetian cannonball destroyed a large section of the Athenian Parthenon in 1687 after the besieged Turks had turned it into a powder magazine.  Victorious forces often purposefully destroy cultural icons and monuments in order to demoralize the conquered, highlighting the difference between cultural and political capital\u2014I am sure nobody at the U.N. Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization cried as the U.S. Marines toppled the statue of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad\u2019s Firdos Square.  Other destruction, such as at the site of the ancient city of Babylon where Iraqi opposition troops were strategically positioned during the invasion, is considered unavoidable collateral damage and is largely overlooked by the international community.  Beyond this, however, a line is drawn by the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict.  According to some international law experts, this convention would hold the United States legally responsible for, among other things, the damage caused when U.S. military forces refused to protect vulnerable cultural sites such as the Baghdad Museum, where looters roamed the grounds undisturbed like hyenas after the kill.</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately, the United States never signed the convention.  With a Hiroshima-induced World War II victory fresh in their minds, the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Eisenhower administration nixed the convention for fear that it would impinge on America\u2019s strategic use of nuclear weapons.  Half a century later, it seems just a little hypocritical that it is in order to preserve the option of using weapons of mass destruction that the U.S. will not be held legally responsible for damage inflicted during a war waged in order to prevent the use of weapons of mass destruction\u2014and ones that don\u2019t seem to exist, at that.</span></p> <p><span>It is time for the United States to move beyond its self-appointed role as global policeman and become a socially responsible world citizen.  If the Bush administration continues to bulldoze through all obstacles in the name of global peace and security, there will be little left to rebuild out of the rubble.  The cultural attrition in Iraq has struck a heavy blow to Iraqi reconstruction, eradicating symbols of cultural unity that might have served as the bedrock of a rejuvenated Iraqi national identity sans Saddam.  Moreover, as the proverbial cradle of civilization, Iraq\u2019s loss is a loss for us all, diluting the reservoir of world heritage and erasing pieces of our common history.  Combined with the war in Afghanistan, when disturbed migratory patterns brought the siberian crane and other species to the brink of extinction, it also forms a disturbing trend.  The United States has ushered in a new era of preemptive war, an era in which it should be able to anticipate and prevent much of the collateral damage its aggression incurs.  So far, however, the Bush administration has projected a devil-may-care attitude, an approach that will only make an enemy of the world and tear it apart in the process.</span></p> <p><span>If the United States truly wishes to amend for its callousness, it should try something a little more substantial than a couple of thousand rent-a-cops in fancy uniforms.  For starters, May 14 would be a prime day to take advantage of the fiftieth anniversary of the Hague Convention by declaring America\u2019s intention to sign and ratify the pact at last.  Becoming a global leader in social responsibility will go farther to ending anti-U.S. sentiment and terrorism than bullying and warmongering ever will.</span></p> <p><span><i>Nicholas R.

Bush, the 43rd president, represents the restoration of the Bush dynasty, which began with his father, George H.W. Bush.</span></p> <p><span>\u201c43 has extended 41,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Phillips said he has traced the Bush family connections to big business and the intelligence community back to George W. Bush\u2019s paternal great-grandfather, Samuel Bush, and maternal great-grandfather, George H. Walker.</span></p> <p><span>Samuel Bush was president of the Buckeye Steel company, which was partially owned by Standard Oil, and John Foster Dulles, the lawyer for Walker\u2019s company, Harriman, eventually became director of the CIA, Phillips said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere is a conflict of interest...[it\u2019s hard to tell] where the Bushes\u2019 policies begin and where the Bushes\u2019 personal connections and business connections begin,\u201d he said. \u201cGeorge H.W.

{"title": "Still the Best Choice | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>As the dramatic Democratic presidential primary season comes to a close, Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., is in a position unthinkable at the close of 2003. He is, after Tuesday\u2019s round of primaries, the certain nominee, and after the elimination of all his serious rivals but President Bush, he is still\u2014as he was a year ago\u2014the strongest candidate in the race. Kerry\u2019s tenacity has shown that he cannot be boiled down to the lowest common denominator. His long legislative history only shows that he gives serious and appropriate consideration to the complicated individual circumstances surrounding the matters presented before him in the Senate. Instead of mindlessly toeing the party line, Kerry has established his own conscientious position as an advocate of the average citizen.</span></p> <p><span>In an American society where intellectualism is often frowned upon, Kerry is still a thinking man. The choice in November will be clear, with a thoughtful, intellectually engaged life-long public servant who will not be afraid to fight a sitting president who has bragged about not reading the newspaper. Certainly, any Harvard student should be able to appreciate the importance of staying informed and making an intellectual contribution to our country\u2019s discourse. Kerry is willing to engage in this discourse, and he will not shy from challenging the president\u2019s lies in public debate.</span></p> <p><span>All of this explains why Kerry is the candidate for America, but it still leaves the question of why he should be the candidate for Harvard students. Though Kerry spent his college years in New Haven, Harvard students should pay him serious heed. It is clear that this year\u2019s presidential election will be critical in shaping the future of this country and the direction of both foreign and domestic policy. With that in mind, college students at Harvard and beyond should pay close attention to some of Kerry\u2019s lesser-known plans and policies.</span></p> <p><span>In an era when a college degree is a prerequisite for an increasing number of jobs, Kerry plans to offer a \u201ctwo-for-four\u201d system. If you give America two years of service, the Kerry administration will fund the equivalent of four years of in-state education\u2014which can be applied to tuition at private institutions or, if the service comes after college, can be used for loan repayment, directed towards vocational training or business start-up fees.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard frequently touts the prominent role of the Phillips Brooks House Association on our campus, and rightfully so. Students work on dozens of projects for thousands of hours every year. This ethic translates into commitments past graduation as well, with serious competition for positions in service programs like Teach for America, which has been summarily kicked to the wayside by the Bush administration. Another service program sought out by students leaving Cambridge after four years is AmeriCorps\u2014yet its size has been halved by congressional Republicans, despite Bush\u2019s promise in his 2002 State of the Union address to increase the number of volunteers by half.</span></p> <p><span>Kerry supports the mission of Teach for America, and he wants to double the size of AmeriCorps. Kerry also plans on expanding the size of the Peace Corps to 25,000, from its current dismal all-time low of 6,500\u2014crucial at a time when the American image is rapidly degrading abroad. This is a part of Kerry\u2019s larger vision to inspire service to America as a normal part of the average citizen\u2019s life, to better the lives and improve the safety of all Americans. The ethic of service that is so strong at Harvard will be expanded to the entire country and expanded in our own lives past graduation.</span></p> <p><span>In a place as politically charged as Harvard, there is no reason not to be involved with the campaign. Since the campaign is just now beginning to focus on the general election, now is the best time to get involved, get noticed and make a difference. The world of campaigns is very fluid and dominated by upward mobility\u2014it is up to the initiative of the individual to make a place within the campaign and excel at it, thus guaranteeing a long-term involvement through the summer. The experience of working for a campaign is unlike any other.</span></p> <p><span>The current atmosphere surrounding the campaign is both vibrant and frenzied. I have watched spirits rise with Kerry\u2019s poll numbers, and I now have no doubt that participating in the leading campaign is an unparalleled experience. The community working on the campaign is on the whole very young, with our peers\u2014on leaves of absence from colleges across the state\u2014usually heading up the key organizational positions for the field work that is accomplished by the local offices.</span></p> <p><span>In conjunction with these opportunities offered through the campaign, there will be innumerable further ways to get involved through the Democratic National Convention, which will be right across the river in Boston this summer. Between these two local opportunities, there is no reason why anger at the administration cannot be transformed into action that will stop the Bush campaign juggernaut.</span></p> <p><span><i>Michael P.

{"title": "Ralph's Return | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>After Ralph Nader announced he would run for president this year, Democrats haunted by the memory of the 2000 election had a fit. After all, he spoiled an election once; he could certainly do it again. But Democrats\u2019 foreboding sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu gives Nader too much credit. Voters may have used Nader\u2019s last campaign to broadcast their dissatisfaction with the options America\u2019s two major parties offered, but they have learned an important lesson. Nader, apparently, has not. Faced with lackluster support, an outdated platform and opposition on all sides, he has stubbornly embarked on what voters must recognize is an empty quest.</span></p> <p><span>It says volumes about the strength of Nader\u2019s candidacy that most voters may not even have the option of voting for the man. As an independent, Nader has to gather signatures in each state to get his name on the ballot\u2014upwards of 1.5 million in total. Texas, the first deadline, requires Nader\u2019s volunteers\u2014he will not hire help\u2014to collect 64,000 signatures by May 13, an enterprise that Texas Democrats will undoubtedly hinder.</span></p> <p><span>The only way for the Nader campaign to escape the sheer magnitude of the task is to garner the support of third parties with ballot lines, such as the Green Party. However, after withdrawing his candidacy for the Green Party nomination, Nader must bank on the \u201cRedraft Nader\u201d campaign, which seeks to grant him party nomination at the Green Party National Convention in June. Even there, his chances for success will be severely diminished by the contingent of Greens who question the logic of running a candidate at all and would prefer to back the Democrats.</span></p> <p><span>Nader is also miserably behind in fundraising. At last count, his campaign had $175,000, a far shot from the $8.5 million he spent in 2000, and his failure to win at least 5 percent of the vote in the last election prevents him from supplementing donations with federal election money.</span></p> <p><span>But the biggest problem for Nader\u2019s campaign is not its tiny war chest. Over the last three and a half years, Nader dug his own grave by saying little as the Bush administration pursued a far-right agenda. Once an outspoken advocate of reform and a significant public figure in the world of American politics, Nader has all but disappeared in the years since the 2000 election. The last four years have seen monumental changes in foreign and domestic policy, but through it all, the man who claims his campaign is based on outrage at the direction the current administration is taking us has remained in the background.</span></p> <p><span>If Nader\u2019s lack of involvement was not bad enough, he has scarcely acknowledged the changed political landscape, choosing to lump the election\u2019s major issues, including health care and the war in Iraq, into what is practically an addendum to his platform from 2000. He insists on pitching the same policies he touted four years ago\u2014but new questions require new answers, and Nader doesn\u2019t have any.</span></p> <p><span>With no real plan and no real political or financial backing, Nader has set out on a hopeless personal crusade, an act that even Democratic candidate Al Sharpton, one of Nader\u2019s strongest supporters in 2000, said portrays him an \u201cegomaniac.\u201d With the 2004 election looming, following him again\u2014disorganized campaign, lagging funding, regurgitated platform and all\u2014is a mistake only the most clueless or cynical voters could make.</span></p>"}

Hyman confirmed plans were in progress for the Harvard Stem Cell Center, which would bring together researchers from the University and affiliated hospitals who are already exploring the promising cells\u2019 potential to help cure diseases like AIDS and diabetes.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe are moving forward on a stem cell center,\u201d Hyman said. \u201cIt\u2019s something Harvard ought to be doing. It is something we can be preeminent in.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The revelation, first reported yesterday in The Boston Globe, comes two weeks after a South Korean laboratory became the first to extract a line of stem cells from a cloned human embryo, disappointing Harvard researchers who had been pursuing the achievement.</span></p> <p><span>A report circulated by Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS) William C. Kirby in January included a proposal to establish a stem cell research program on the University\u2019s lands in Allston.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cNot only does the Institute propose to bridge the gap from basic to applied life science, it also proposes to address the complex social, ethical and religious questions that have arisen as stem cell research has advanced,\u201d read the report obtained by The Crimson.</span></p> <p><span>Human embryonic stem cells, which can harness the potency of fertilized eggs to form any variety of human tissue, have emerged as a pivotal\u2014and controversial\u2014field of study.</span></p> <p><span>Bush administration restrictions limit government-financed research to pre-existing stem cells, but Hyman said the University would seek funding for the center from private donors and foundations.</span></p> <p><span>The January report said 20 faculty would be required for the effort, including five new recruitments. Hyman would not confirm those numbers yesterday but said additional hirings were a possibility.</span></p> <p><span>According to the report, the research program would link the work of scientists currently working on stem cells at FAS, Harvard Medical School (HMS) and Harvard hospitals.</span></p> <p><span>The report says that the center will focus initially on four \u201cdisease areas\u201d: blood diseases including AIDS, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases and cardiovascular diseases.</span></p> <p><span>The center will initially exist without a home, said Associate Professor of Medicine David T. Scadden, who will co-direct the program, but a physical presence is on the agenda.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cUltimately, we do think it would be best if we did have a physical space where there was a core group of researchers that were working together,\u201d Scadden said.</span></p> <p><span>According to the report, the proposed stem cell center would include new lab facilities for researchers and an \u201cadministrative infrastructure to support the work.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>After the breakthrough in South Korea last month, Scadden said Harvard needed to redouble its efforts in stem cell research.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible disappointment that we\u2019re reading about it from other countries,\u201d Scadden said in early February. \u201cIt\u2019s imperative that we be able to use this technology in the U.S.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But Scadden said yesterday that plans for the center have been forming for more than a year and were not in response to the developments in South Korea.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard scientists have seen their share of breakthroughs on stem cell research in recent years.</span></p> <p><span>Most recently, Cabot Professor of the Natural Sciences Douglas A. Melton announced last November he had created 17 new stem cell lines for research.</span></p> <p><span>But under federal regulations, those stem cells can only be studied with private funds, like those which will likely finance the center.</span></p> <p><span>Melton, who will be co-director of the center, declined to comment on any specifics yesterday.</span></p> <p><span>The move toward a consolidated center for stem cell research is one in a number of moves University President Lawrence H. Summers has made to emphasize life sciences. Harvard and MIT joined last summer to announce the creation of the Broad Institute, which will devote at least $300 million to the study of the human genome.</span></p> <p><span>Hyman would not say how much money the University would seek from outside donors for the stem cell program but said the amount would be \u201csubstantial.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>That fundraising effort, which Scadden said will officially begin this week, will likely coincide with a University capital campaign and several other individual programs.</span></p> <p><span>Scadden said the center would include research in adult and animal stem cells, as well more controversial human embryonic stem cells.</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff writer Zachary M.

{"title": "It's the Biography, Stupid | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Empty beer bottles, volcanic breath and a girl whose name begins with M\u2014maybe\u2014those are the seeds of fraternity lore, the fond memories of barely remembered nights. They are the bygone decisions of bygone days, charming and without consequence, excused as quickly as they are made.</span></p> <p><span>This Mardi Gras season, few know the rules of the carnival better than George W. Bush, our Fratboy in Chief. All acts can be plausibly denied. Memories rarely take root. As the room spins, truth and accountability turn on their heads.</span></p> <p><span>It was the story of Bush\u2019s youth, and now, it\u2019s the story of his presidency.  You have probably heard Bush-bashers like me rattle off his rap sheet before, from the economy to the environment, Iraq to Afghanistan, energy policy to the war on terror. We continue to indulge ourselves because, like Al Gore \u201969 with his imaginary lockbox, we don\u2019t know how else to communicate what seems only too obvious.</span></p> <p><span>Bush is ruining America. If you fly the flag, for instance, you should be shocked by the White House\u2019s outing of CIA agent Valerie Plame and Bush\u2019s missing months with the Texas Air National Guard, where he abused his privilege to get the assignment in the first place, ahead of more than 100,000 others on the waiting list. If you dream of democratic dominos in the Middle East, you should balk at a unilateralism poised to rebuild Iraq in Afghanistan\u2019s chaotic image. And if you\u2019re a fiscal conservative, well, you probably thought already to check your children\u2019s wallets\u2014metaphorically, for the childless\u2014since the burden of deficits approaching half a trillion dollars will be theirs.</span></p> <p><span>Little of this seems to stick to Bush, however, even as desperation sticks to us dissenters. Bush laid low while we inveighed against him for months, and yet his approval rating continues to hover around 50 percent. Indeed, the greatest casualty of the Dean-led denigration this primary season was Dean himself.</span></p> <p><span>To dethrone Bush, insurgents will have to reach out beyond those who screamed at the TV during the State of the Union, their feet resting beside Al Franken\u2019s book on their coffee table. I\u2019m convinced that many who voted for Bush in 2000 have misgivings about the direction he has dragged the Republican Party. After all, his campaign is nervous. Bush attacked Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass. directly at a fundraiser last Monday, earlier in the race than his handlers had originally planned and before the Democrats had even settled on a nominee.</span></p> <p><span>But converting doubt into swing votes will require that the Democrats resolve a fundamental paradox. If Bush is a lying liar, as most of the country has already heard, then who was the gutsy leader who emerged in the aftermath of 9/11?  How can Bush voters reconcile their adoration then\u2014when his gravitas inspired comparisons to Churchill during World War II and the Kennedys during the Cuban Missile Crisis\u2014with his recklessness since?</span></p> <p><span>They can\u2019t, fortunately, and Bush\u2019s opponents have the unenviable job of delivering disillusionment. To paraphrase the Clinton campaign, it\u2019s the biography, stupid.</span></p> <p><span>In his rise from high school dolt to Yale alum, from addict governor to born-again president, Bush was rewarded over and over for finding dubious backdoors when misbehavior and mediocrity closed off the front. The once-Skull and Bones, now O\u2019Douls drinker learned early to say things he doesn\u2019t mean and make commitments he has no intention of keeping.</span></p> <p><span>When Bush was failing as an investor, Daddy rescued his sagging share in Harken with a windfall contract for oil drilling in Bahrain, despite Harken\u2019s dismal history and lack of off-shore experience. The Bush pedigree bought Dubya his stake in Texas politics, even though his recklessness, not to mention his dope-dimmed mind, would have denied it to anyone else. Then, as governor, he exploited the University of Texas\u2019s state-funded endowment to funnel investment money to his cronies.</span></p> <p><span>None of this squares with the narrative of Bush immediately after 9/11, of course, but that\u2019s only because Bush\u2019s handlers reinvented him for a few short months. For that brief time, he seemed to share in America\u2019s collective shock and to channel it, without cynicism, into a world coalition against terror.</span></p> <p><span>It wasn\u2019t long, however, before the real Bush reemerged, with all of his opportunistic alchemy. First he converted terrorist hysteria into repressive gold with the USA PATRIOT Act, and then into corporate gold with crass tax cuts and, finally, into neocon gold with a preemptive war in Iraq.</span></p> <p><span>Al Gore dared not attack Bush on his character in 2000 because Gore knew that disgust with Clinton might stain him by association. Kerry has no such baggage. He may be a Skull and Bones like Bush, but his heroism in Vietnam and public service in the Senate give him abundant patriotic currency. Likewise, should John Edwards somehow steal the nomination, he can boast of a working class success story that embodies the American dream.</span></p> <p><span>For Democrats to beat Bush, Americans must realize that they were duped after 9/11. He lies rather than leads by nature, which is obvious in any narrative of his life that links the prodigal son with his prodigal policies as president. As a sound byte, the message is simple.  It\u2019s the biography, stupid.</span></p> <p><span><i>Blake Jennelle \u201904 is an social studies concentrator in Adams House. His column appears on alternate Mondays.</i></span></p>"}

Kerry, D-Mass. is poised for the Democratic presidential nomination thanks to resounding victories from coast to coast in yesterday\u2019s Super Tuesday primaries, including a 50-plus point victory in Massachusetts.</span></p> <p><span>On campus, members of the Harvard College Democrats applauded the news and said they would rally behind the candidate whose chief rival, Sen. John R. Edwards, D-N.C., is expected to announce that he will drop out of the race today.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt looks like we have a nominee,\u201d College Dems President Andy J. Frank \u201905 told the group of students gathered in the Quincy House Junior Common Room last night to watch the returns.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe\u2019re united now,\u201d Frank told the group.</span></p> <p><span>Nicholas F.B. Smyth \u201905, the president of Harvard Students for Kerry, said that after 14 months of hard work for the campaign, he was excited to see his candidate seal up the nomination.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis is like every political junkie\u2019s dream come true,\u201d said a wired if tired Smyth.</span></p> <p><span>He said the group would now turn their attention to the general elections, where he expects President George W. Bush to make national security a key issue as he runs on a \u201ccampaign of fear.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cKerry has shown people, and he\u2019ll continue to show people, that he\u2019s the one to trust if you\u2019re scared,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Edwards supporters were sad to reach the end of the road for their candidate, but pledged to work with Kerry.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of disappointment, but there are bigger issues to address and still much work to be done,\u201d said Brittani S. Head \u201906, president of Students For Edwards. \u201cAt least a senator named John got it.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Head said she would be asking all the members of her group to \u201cthrow their full support\u201d behind the Democratic nominee.</span></p> <p><span>Kerry, who had been surfing the wave of early victories in Iowa and New Hampshire, won easily in his home state of Massachusetts yesterday with over 70 percent of the vote.</span></p> <p><span>He also snapped up delegates from California, New York, Ohio, Maryland, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Minnesota\u2014all of which he took in double-digit victories.</span></p> <p><span>Kerry won by a close margin in Georgia, which had been considered a must-win for Edwards.</span></p> <p><span>The only Super Tuesday state that Kerry did not take was Vermont, where voters supported their former governor, Howard B. Dean, by a wide margin. Dean dropped out of the race last month after generating early buzz but failing to win any of the previous state contests.</span></p> <p><span>After going winless yesterday, Edwards did not concede the race in his speech to supporters last night, but two Democratic officials told the Associated Press that Edwards will announce today that he is dropping out of the race.</span></p> <p><span>Several Edwards backers said the tight calendar of the primaries hurt their candidate, because it allowed Kerry to build momentum and emerge as the frontrunner.</span></p> <p><span>Assistant Professor of Government William G. Howell agreed that Kerry\u2019s momentum was a factor.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s really difficult to overcome no matter who you are,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you are Edwards, who is affable and quite attractive, but is a first-term senator and doesn\u2019t have the money or the organization to mount a counter-offensive, it becomes quite difficult.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Frank, who supported Edwards in the primaries, said after the College Dems\u2019 meeting that Kerry\u2019s string of victories meant the electoral math was stacked against Edwards.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think Edwards is going out at the right time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the classy thing to do to bow out...so Kerry can start spending his resources on Bush.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Many of Kerry\u2019s backers pointed to their candidate\u2019s ability to beat the incumbent president as a key reason for their support.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cKerry is eminently electable,\u201d said Evan W. Hudson \u201904, who cast his ballot yesterday at the polling station in the foyer of Quincy House. \u201cThe more moderate candidate always wins.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think that what we are seeing right now is a more passionate Democratic electorate than we have seen in decades,\u201d said Stirling Professor of History and Social Policy Alexander Keyssar of the Kennedy School of Government. \u201cThe passion isn\u2019t a pro-Kerry passion, particularly. It\u2019s an anti-Bush passion.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>He said he thought this was because \u201cthe Bush administration has appeared particularly reckless and frequently dishonest.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In addition to his perceived electability, supporters said Kerry\u2019s experience\u2014especially in the area of foreign policy\u2014and his stature in the Democratic party made him stand out above the other candidates.</span></p> <p><span>According to Kenan Professor of Government Harvey C. Mansfield \u201953, Kerry, a decorated Vietnam veteran, represents a \u201cwar hero to oppose a war president in Bush.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAlthough [Democrats are] not serious about the war, they want to impress people who might be,\u201d Mansfield said.</span></p> <p><span>As the College Dems prepare to unite behind Kerry, the Harvard Republican Club plans to campaign for Bush in Massachusetts and nearby states, according to spokesperson Lauren K. Truesdell \u201906, who said the group hoped the Institute of Politics would fund a trip to swing states such as Pennsylvania or Florida.</span></p> <p><span>She said the campaign would \u201cfocus on successes in the war on terror.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe economy will also be an issue, with the Bush tax cuts and the current economic upturn being helpful to the president,\u201d Truesdell added.</span></p> <p><span>Josh M. Mendelsohn \u201905, the chair of Harvard Students for Bush, said he was confident that voters would look at the two candidates\u2019 records carefully and, in the end, choose Bush.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think when voters go to the polls in November, they\u2019re going to recognize that their options are between a leader who\u2019s proven his service as a leader over the past four years and a man who had his chance in the Senate and supported a series of poor policies that threatened the nation,\u201d said Mendelsohn, who is also the chair of Massachusetts Students for Bush.</span></p> <p><span>Keyssar predicted it will be \u201can incredibly nasty campaign.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>He said Kerry\u2019s key to victory would be to bring new voters to the polls, just as Dean tried to do before dropping out of the race.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf he can increase turnout by 5 percent, he\u2019ll win,\u201d Keyssar said.</span></p> <p><span>With Kerry emerging as the Democratic nominee, speculation now centers on who he will choose as his running mate.</span></p> <p><span>Edwards has long been rumored to be a possibility, and Head said she thought he would make a good choice, especially since he\u2019s not running for reelection to the Senate.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe\u2019s kind of jobless, so I guess he\u2019s got to do something for the next four years,\u201d she joked.</span></p> <p><span>According to Howell, the choice of a vice president is often a matter of geography, as presidential candidates look for running mates from states where they need a boost in votes.</span></p> <p><span>He pointed to how John F. Kennedy \u201940 chose Lyndon B. Johnson, a fellow senator from Texas.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cKerry might want to replicate this,\u201d Howell said. \u201cEdwards is from the South, and it\u2019s important to make some inroads there.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Another issue worth considering, Howell said, is how Kerry will use his time between now and the November elections, once the end of the primary season takes him out of the day-to-day media spotlight.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cBecause he\u2019s won early, his ability to dominate the news is going to slip, and you\u2019ve got to give the edge to Bush in the coming months to start making a comeback both in defining Kerry, his opponent, and also defining his own presidency,\u201d Howell said.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Claire Provost contributed to the reporting of this story.

{"title": "LOVE IT OR LEEVE IT: Five Wishes For New Baseball Season | Sports | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Without fail, every spring I wax poetic about the return of baseball and all that is Good and True in the world. Baseball is part of American culture.</span></p> <p><span>Just look at last year\u2019s playoffs and the Red Sox and Cubs fans. During the off-season, baseball stayed in the headlines, what with THG, the incredible amount of player movement and the insane Sox-Yankees competition.</span></p> <p><span>But for all the entertainment that baseball provided, it proved over and over that the game is tainted. Now when players report to camp, we wonder who\u2019s juiced, who\u2019s not and who the hell is on what team.</span></p> <p><span>I know, though, that baseball will endure. The allegiances and rivalries of the game may encourage doing whatever it takes to get ahead, but that competitive fire is also undeniably precious. So with that optimism, I give you my top five wishes for the season ahead.</span></p> <p><span><b>5. Roger Clemens and Andy Pettitte become power hitters.</b></span></p> <p><span>How funny is it going to be to see these two hulking power pitchers bat for the first time in their careers?</span></p> <p><span>I want to see them get brushed back, glare at the opposing pitcher and then slap a liner right back at the mound. I want them to whiff so bad that the outfielders feel the breeze. I want them to share tips on hitting during their daily workouts.</span></p> <p><span>I want one of them to go head-to-head with Mark Prior or Kerry Wood, matching zeroes inning after inning, and then win the game with a walk-off homer.</span></p> <p><span>Hey, it is a field of dreams after all...</span></p> <p><span><b>4. Pitchers actually pitch to Barry Bonds.</b></span></p> <p><span>Put an asterisk next to his name if you want, but good Lord, can Bonds hit. I bet he could crank out close to 100 homers if he saw anything decent at the plate.</span></p> <p><span>Let\u2019s see him try.</span></p> <p><span><b>3. A big name to get caught on steroids.</b></span></p> <p><span>Truthfully, only a dumb player with horrible trainers is going to get caught juicing. The testing policy is such a joke that nothing will happen to the guy until the fifth positive test anyway.</span></p> <p><span>Still, imagine what would happen if Bonds or Jason Giambi or Gary Sheffield actually got caught. A report in the San Francisco Chronicle yesterday said that investigators were told those three sluggers received steroids from BALCO and that Bonds also used human growth hormone.</span></p> <p><span>Big surprise, right? I mean, I even wrote a final paper last semester on THG and steroids and how they are entrenched in professional sports. These three ballooned late in their careers, and even Bonds\u2019 head got noticeably bigger\u2014a possible side effect of hGH.</span></p> <p><span>That\u2019s right, his head actually got bigger.</span></p> <p><span>But even though steroid use is obvious, oh man, just imagine if one of them got caught. Just imagine.</span></p> <p><span><b>2. Toronto makes a run in the AL East.</b></span></p> <p><span>All during the off-season, you hear the Red Sox this and the Yankees that. But people, the Blue Jays ain\u2019t bad.</span></p> <p><span>They\u2019ve got Roy Halladay, Vernon Wells, and Carlos Delgado. As ESPN\u2019s Jayson Stark pointed out, Halladay was the rotation last year on a team that won 86 games. Toronto has added six veterans to their staff. Add in the RBI machines Wells and Delgado, and this team has a serious shot at the playoffs.</span></p> <p><span>And how funny would it be if one or both of the Sox and Yanks fall flat on their overpaid faces and tank? So funny.</span></p> <p><span><b>1. Houston wins the World Series.</b></span></p> <p><span>This team has the talent.</span></p> <p><span>The Astros have the best rotation in baseball. Wade Miller is only the fourth best starter on the team. Clemens is only third.</span></p> <p><span>The lineup is stacked top to bottom, including Bags, Bidge, Kent, Berkman, and Doggy. Brad Ausmus, the best catcher in the league, is back. Octavio Dotel is finally getting to close, and he\u2019s ready.</span></p> <p><span>This team deserves it, too.</span></p> <p><span>It\u2019s so easy to root for Houston: missing the playoffs by one lousy game, not one playoff series win in the history of the team, the return of two hometown heroes this season. And man, the fans want it\u2014they blew out the switchboard calling for season tickets.</span></p> <p><span>The Astros are a team harking back to the Good and the True\u2014it\u2019s their time.

So here\u2019s a new talking point that I suggest the Democrats try out to keep the election interesting and maybe even improve their chance of uprooting the Shrub: Bush\u2019s tax cuts, by increasing economic inequality, could undermine political equality\u2014that is to say, democracy itself. This is where a dead Frenchman comes in.</span></p> <p><span>In the very latest instance of French praise for America\u2014Alexis de Tocqueville\u2019s 1835 masterpiece Democracy in America\u2014the author notes the remarkable \u201cequality of conditions\u201d in the United States and connects America\u2019s socioeconomic equality to our democratic blessings. \u201cBy no possibility could equality ultimately fail to penetrate into the sphere of politics as everywhere else,\u201d de Tocqueville wrote at that time. (Incidentally, a 2002 study of New World societies by the National Bureau of Economic Research backs him up, observing that \u201cwhere there was extreme inequality, as in most of the societies of the Americas, political institutions were less democratic,\u201d than those where settlers started out relatively equal.) Today, there is typically a 25 to 30 percent gap in voter turnout between America\u2019s top and bottom income quintiles and the rich can further enhance their participation with hefty campaign contributions. Put simply, people\u2019s ability to exert influence in the political arena is not unrelated to their economic means.</span></p> <p><span>As obvious as that may seem, Democrats have been too timid to point out the implication: Bush\u2019s grossly lop sided tax cuts, by exacerbating economic inequality, will ultimately foster a more unequal distribution of the means for participating in political power. (For instance, axing the estate tax, which had applied to only the top two percent of estates, raises the prospect of making that inequality hereditary.) It\u2019s no surprise then that their case for repealing the cuts has fallen flat.</span></p> <p><span>The Dems have pointed out the injustice of the skewed rewards of the tax cuts, and they are right to do so. But over-reliance on framing the issue in terms of winners and losers or the \u201ctwo Americas\u201d (real though those divisions are) exposes the Democrats to the bogus but potent charge of class warfare. \u201cStrengthening democracy\u201d would be a much more unifying aspiration.</span></p> <p><span>And a too-narrow appeal to Joe Voter\u2019s wallet won\u2019t end the Republican hegemony either. Kerry, for example, promises to \u201cgive every American access to the health care plan that the President and members of Congress already have,\u201d while Edwards, during his candidacy, wanted to provide tax credits \u201cto help working families own a piece of the rock.\u201d These are fine ideas and highlighting the programs we could afford by repealing tax cuts for the rich is a smart tactic. But as long as the debate remains at the level of making promises to cash out the public purse, the GOP can hold its own. Not only did they put tax rebate checks in the mail, they even implemented a big new entitlement program: the prescription drug benefit.</span></p> <p><span>Of course, the Republicans \u201cpaid\u201d for these initiatives by charging them direct to the burgeoning national debt: \u201cthe best things in life are free; for everything else, there\u2019s Future Generations of Taxpayers.\u201d But then, with both parties going on about doling out individual goodies (whether tax breaks or entitlements), it\u2019s easy to distract the public from the mounting deficits; since their costs will fall on everybody,  nobody wants to deal with them. I guess you could say the voters have been fooled by the \u201cpiece of the rock\u201d they got...in the mail. But a common goal of preserving democratic vitality could save our budgetary keisters: allowing Democrats to muster political support for the fiscal responsibility needed to sustain egalitarian policies.</span></p> <p><span>But to return to my original point\u2014that the key issue here is to avert \u201cSnore 2004\u201d\u2014I would draw the Democrats\u2019 attention to the film that won eleven Oscars last Sunday: the final installment of The Lord of the Rings trilogy. It was not the hobbits\u2019 quest for more generous Medicare benefits that made that epic film so captivating. Nor was it Aragorn\u2019s rousing rhetoric on the \u201ctwo Middle-earths.\u201d No, it was the struggle between good and evil and the triumph over tyranny that captured our hearts (and our cash). A showdown over the future of American democracy would be equally stirring.</span></p> <p><span>Well, that\u2019s not exactly true. But it could easily be, say, 1/10 as entertaining as The Lord of the Rings. And for a debate on economic policy, that\u2019s not bad.</span></p> <p><span><i>Eoghan W.

{"title": "Constitutional Discrimination | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>President Bush\u2019s official announcement late last month to support the Federal Marriage Amendment, which would rewrite the Constitution to prevent same-sex marriage, came as no surprise. In fact, it is almost humorous that CNN would send out a breaking news update to alert its subscribers of this fact. Bush has danced around the issue of same-sex marriage for months, attempting to allow conservative analysts the time to calculate his political strategy. His State of the Union address this year offered a hint at what was to come, but shied away from any explicit statements.</span></p> <p><span>In the end, it took Karl Rove a little less than a month to prepare his puppet for an announcement that affirmed support for one of the most egregious acts of proposed legislation of this new century.</span></p> <p><span>As usual, Bush\u2019s rhetoric in the Feb. 24 speech did not go far beyond reiterating empty allusions to his narrow perception of the United States\u2019 \u201ccultural, religious and natural roots.\u201d By this he refers to the cultural hegemony of an Anglo-Saxon, Protestant conservatism. Allowing same-sex couples the right to enter into civil marriage in the United States does not, however, impinge in any way on the cultural or religious freedoms that Bush claims to protect. Instead, it affords bisexual, gay, lesbian and transgender (BGLT) people a legal status that is granted unconditionally to heterosexual couples upon request.</span></p> <p><span>In many ways, the Federal Marriage Amendment launches us back to 1912, when Rep. Seaborn Roddenberry, D-Ga., introduced an amendment to ban interracial marriage. In his speech before Congress, Roddenberry said, \u201cIntermarriage between whites and blacks is repulsive and averse to every sentiment of pure American spirit...It is destructive of moral supremacy, and ultimately this slavery to black beasts will bring this nation to a fatal conflict.\u201d The same hateful rhetoric that Roddenberry espoused more than 90 years ago can now be seen flowing from the mouths of the religious right about same-sex marriage. But attitudes are changing, and it will not be long before Bush\u2019s comments are seen by the general populace to be as despicable as Roddenberry\u2019s.</span></p> <p><span>Bush asks his fellow Americans to \u201cconduct this difficult debate in a manner worthy of our country, without bitterness or anger.\u201d President Bush, the Bisexual, Gay, Lesbian, Transgender and Supporters Alliance (BGLTSA) is angry, and we have every right to be bitter. Bush has trampled on the rights of BGLT people for far too long, and this time he has gone too far. He may be able to silence  Mary Cheney, but he certainly cannot quiet queer America.</span></p> <p><span>Rallies around the country, from Boston to San Francisco, are raising the consciousness of a nation. We are not willing to accept the illogical and inane arguments of the religious right. The website of the Alliance for Marriage, a coalition formed to encourage \u201cmore children raised in a home with a mother and a father,\u201d cites an article asserting that \u201c\u2018gay marriage\u2019 devalues women.\u201d The article states emphatically that women (or men) would be rendered superfluous in a world of same-sex marriages\u2014but it refuses to show how two men or women choosing to enter the institution of marriage will degrade the institution of marriage for heterosexuals. Matt Daniels, president of the Alliance for Marriage, asserts that \u201cmarriage is the key to reducing the high levels of youth crime and child poverty.\u201d Even if we believe this claim, though, it\u2019s still hard to see how Daniels can get away with scapegoating the BGLT population instead of addressing the divorce and broken homes that are the endpoint for so many heterosexual marriages. Illogical arguments like this only serve to incite hatred and violence against BGLT people.</span></p> <p><span>The United States Constitution is not a place for zealots and bigots to enshrine discrimination, especially when an ABC News/Washington Post poll reported that 48 percent of respondents said that the states should decide on the issue of same-sex marriage, whereas only 43 percent actually supported the proposed amendment. With or without widespread support, though, this amendment is a miscarriage of justice that would create a constitutionally-delineated second-class status for the BGLT population.</span></p> <p><span>The text of the proposed Federal Marriage Amendment does not stop at defining marriage as a \u201cunion of a man and a woman\u201d\u2014it goes on to strip some BGLT people of the domestic partnership benefits that they have fought valiantly to gain over the past decades. Supporters of the amendment have claimed that it would continue to allow non-marriage civil unions, but the proposed amendment unambiguously states, \u201cNeither this Constitution or the constitution of any State, nor state or federal law, shall be construed to require that marital status or the legal incidents thereof be conferred upon unmarried couples or groups.\u201d The \u201clegal incidents\u201d of marriage that are offered by many states, counties, cities and employers are vital to the livelihoods of BGLT people. Retracting these rights would not only disallow the ability of BGLT people to take advantage of tax benefits and access to estates, but it would prohibit them as well from visiting their loved ones in hospitals as anything more than a friend.</span></p> <p><span>As the debate about the Federal Marriage Amendment grows near, there is an increased need for activism. Living in Cambridge, Harvard students have the incredible opportunity to be at the forefront of this battle for equality. Despite the unlikelihood of the amendment gaining the two-thirds support in both houses of Congress and the support of constitutional conventions in 38 states that it needs to become law, it is imperative that we support efforts to end discrimination against the BGLT population. Write letters to your state senators encouraging them to join the fight or thanking them for their support. And join the BGLTSA on March 11 at noon at the Massachusetts State House to oppose parallel efforts to write in discrimination to the Massachusetts state constitution. Let us hope the next time there is a CNN breaking news update, it reads, \u201cFederal Marriage Amendment Fails in Congress.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><i>Adam P.

{"title": "Future Imperfect | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>I doubt the Bush campaign asked for permission from the family of the 9-11 victim whose flag-draped body appears in the latest Bush-Cheney commercial, and I\u2019m glad it backfired.  But the less-controversial elements of the new, expensive TV spots represent something Democrats should study and even imitate.</span></p> <p><span>Regardless of the brief moment of poor taste concerning 9/11, the ads are extremely well done. Bush strides along the White House colonnade with a West Wing gait, and footage of him talking is interspersed with images of Americans living their lives in an uncertain world. In one of the spots, Bush says with conviction, \u201cI know exactly where I want to lead this country.\u201d I believe him. The commercials are composed of half memory, half hope\u2014they strike a perfect balance between awareness of recent history and attention to the nation\u2019s future.</span></p> <p><span>Now it is up to John Kerry, still a blank slate to most Americans, to persuade the country that he has as much boldness in his future as he had in his past.  Most attentive voters know a lot about Kerry\u2019s role in history\u2014Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam\u2014but how many know what exactly he intends to do with health care, energy policy and war?</span></p> <p><span>As the primary season gives way to the general election, Kerry has two related challenges if he is to define himself before Bush does: to make sure his vision is getting through, and to speak as much about himself as he does about Bush.  Traditionally, this is viewed as striking a balance between positive and negative campaigning, but Kerry might do well to look at the balance between past and future in his approach.</span></p> <p><span>History has its place, but a lack of balance in the campaign\u2014evidenced by the fact that people know more about his Vietnam service than his politics\u2014can only play into Bush\u2019s hands by taking focus away from the future, which is where his true advantage lies.  Comfortable with the tactic of personal politics, operatives may prefer to work in terms of personal history rather than ideological vision, but until they can convey their plans for the future, Democrats have a complaint, not an argument.</span></p> <p><span>Using history as an argument makes some sense, especially for the Left. On the large scale, history as we learn it is mainly an ongoing tale of issues on which conservatives were dead wrong: wrong about the Revolution, prohibition, slavery, the New Deal, civil rights, Vietnam, and most painfully, wrong about it being a good idea to support dictators and terrorists in the Muslim world as part of the Cold War. Turning to more recent history, I want to know what Bush was doing when he was supposed to be drilling for the National Guard, and how he got discharged so easily. We need to know how much he knew about terror warnings in August, 2001, and what he did on his unusually long August vacation when some in the CIA were panicking about new threats. I\u2019d like to know what will come of the grand jury on the CIA leak probe, which issued several subpoenas to the White House Friday. We need to understand that history to spare our nation the danger of repeating it.</span></p> <p><span>But attention to history is only half the picture, and relying on the past to explain one\u2019s candidacy is the equivalent of waiting for Bush to politically implode on his own.  It could work, but it\u2019s not a very inspiring or promising tactic.</span></p> <p><span>Frustratingly, Kerry continues to play the history game, even as it becomes increasingly clear that the most urgent reasons to elect him have to do with the future.  All but one of the last few press releases from his campaign mention Bush more than Kerry, leaving precious little space for a positive plan for the future.  Worse, when he does lay out innovative policies, there is little sign of them in the press.  When Vanessa Kerry, his daughter, spoke to students at Harvard last week, she offered the most compelling case for a Kerry presidency I have yet heard, and\u2014this is novel\u2014she did it entirely in terms of policy, with far more mentions of her father than of Bush.  Kerry needs to stress this part of the picture until the press is compelled to show it.</span></p> <p><span>Spending more energy on the future is a critical task for Kerry and his party, because the future offers the most powerful positive and negative arguments for a Democratic administration.</span></p> <p><span>On the negative side, the future is when we will see the government crippled by the massive Bush tax cuts, while the economy tries to survive the impact of enormous deficits on interest rates and American credit.  The future is when we face the consequences of living in an international community where pre-emptive war is a familiar doctrine of international relations, with America notorious for crying wolf.  And the consensus of the scientific community is that the future is endangered by today\u2019s fuel emissions.  Just to be clear, I don\u2019t mean the flying-cars, food-in-a-pill future; on average, most of these looming disasters will land on us right about the time that our kids are heading for college.</span></p> <p><span>On the positive side, the future is when we could find out what it is like to live without dependence on foreign oil, or any oil. We would get to live in a nation where youth are bound together by a national service program which does needed work, instills values, and makes college more affordable at the same time. We could finally see a single-payer health care system that closes the gap between the U.S. and other nations when it comes to medical treatment. And we could travel abroad in a world that views America as a leader, not a danger.  These are all promises from Kerry that have yet to break into the public conversation.</span></p> <p><span>None of this will get across if Democrats give into the temptation to leap for the past.  History is half of the picture, but it is only useful because it justifies alternative hopes for the future, which ought to be the real purpose of any campaign.  It is up to Kerry to get these hopes across in the coming months, and to get the media to pay as much attention to his proposals as to his hair.</span></p> <p><span><i>Peter P.M.

{"title": "Indecency on the Airwaves | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Two weeks ago, John Hogan received a horrible shock.</span></p> <p><span>Hogan, the CEO of Clear Channel Communications, discovered that Howard Stern can be crude. Clear Channel, the nation\u2019s largest radio company, has been making millions off of Stern\u2019s antics for years. Unfortunately for Stern, after Janet Jackson\u2019s bare breast shocked the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) into enforcing a new code of decency on the airwaves\u2014clearly a priority for the country right now\u2014Hogan discovered Stern\u2019s curious style and decided the show wasn\u2019t appropriate for radio. Citing its desire to protect Americans from indecency, Clear Channel has removed Stern from six radio markets.</span></p> <p><span>But Clear Channel\u2019s treatment of Stern is interesting not because it is a new phenomenon for the media giant, but because it isn\u2019t.</span></p> <p><span>Long before Jackson\u2019s breast initiated a new era of FCC involvement in broadcasting, Clear Channel was using its tremendous power to control what Americans hear. When the Dixie Chicks criticized the war in Iraq, for example, Clear Channel refused to play their music. The company\u2019s executives also chose to silence Charles Goyette, a decorated veteran and former Reaganite who got his start in politics by running Barry Goldwater\u2019s student operation during \u201cMr. Conservative\u2019s\u201d 1964 presidential bid. Until recently, Goyette was a drive-time radio host at a Philadelphia Clear Channel station. But when President Bush began moving the country towards war, he questioned Bush\u2019s rationale\u2014and found his show moved from one of the best slots in radio to one of the worst. Thanks to his recently signed five-year contract, he was free to go on criticizing Bush, but Clear Channel made certain that nobody would be listening.</span></p> <p><span>Clear Channel\u2019s desire to control what the public hears also often leads the company to engage in tactics even more blatantly inimical to the democratic process. When the Democratic National Committee attempted to run an advertisement criticizing Rep. Charles \u201cChip\u201d Pickering Jr, R-Miss., two Mississippi Clear Channel stations refused to run the ad. Incidentally, Pickering sits on the House Telecommunications Subcommittee, which is responsible for overseeing the telecommunications industry\u2014including Clear Channel\u2019s operations.</span></p> <p><span>But Clear Channel is just one company, and even though we feel that its decisions are often frustratingly irresponsible\u2014or just asinine, as in Stern\u2019s case\u2014it has the right to air what it wants. The real problem is that Clear Channel dominates the American radio market\u2014so the intolerant conservatives running the San Antonio, Texas-based company get to inflict their views on the rest of the country. Since 1996, when Congress relaxed the rules that govern media ownership, Clear Channel has gone from 30 radio stations to more than 1200. This amounts to roughly one out of every ten American stations. But more importantly, Clear Channel controls as much as half the radio market in certain big cites, and new mergers, combined with lax regulation, promise to raise that number significantly in some markets.</span></p> <p><span>That means when Clear Channel refuses to run a Democratic Party ad, they can prevent as much as half of a major city from ever hearing it. To make matters worse, the FCC under Chairman Michael Powell, who used to help corporations evade anti-trust laws for a living, has repeatedly attempted to relax the already weak regulations that govern media conglomerates. This would be disturbing even if Clear Channel weren\u2019t so politically assertive.</span></p> <p><span>The FCC should focus more of its attention on the real indecency on America\u2019s airwaves. Howard Stern may be crude, but Clear Channel\u2019s reckless behavior, and the steady deregulation that let it become the loudest voice in American radio, is obscene.</span></p>"}

Bush\u2019s home state.</span></p> <p><span>With election day just six weeks from Tuesday, Kerry ensured a crowd of about 1,000 local supporters at the newly completed Boston Convention and Exhibition Center that he is not discouraged by his deficit to President Bush at this point in the race.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI feel those October juices flowing,\u201d Kerry said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been at this for a while and when those juices get flowing, I feel good.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In his short but energized speech Kerry told stories from the campaign trail and criticized Bush for the war in Iraq and the state of the economy.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThey don\u2019t have a record to run on, they have a record to run away from,\u201d Kerry said.</span></p> <p><span>Kerry\u2019s wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry, also spoke at the dinner, telling the crowd how much she has enjoyed campaigning with her husband.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe greatest gift of this campaign has been meeting the wonderful people of this country,\u201d Heinz said.</span></p> <p><span>The fund-raiser\u2014the last one that Kerry will attend before the election\u2014required a minimum donation of $1,000 to attend the pre-dinner cocktail reception and $5,000 to attend the entire program.</span></p> <p><span>While the high donation requirement prohibited most Harvard students from attending, at least one found his way into the dinner\u2014Undergraduate Council President Matthew W.

Vodscka, the president of the Amalgamates, said her group received a surprise phone call inviting them to perform at the event about a week and a half ago.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cEverybody was so excited that we were willing to put in the extra practice time,\u201d Vodscka said.</span></p> <p><span>While not everyone was so lucky to score a ticket to the event, people found other ways of participating.</span></p> <p><span>About 50 people lined the street outside of the convention center to show support for Kerry and possibly get a glimpse of their candidate.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe\u2019d just like to see him drive by,\u201d said Chris Wohlers, a 15 year-old home-schooled student from Boston.</span></p> <p><span>Many of the donors inside the event expressed similarly strong support for Kerry and uneasiness about Bush administration policies. Marshall Bradstreet, a local businessman, said this was the first time he had donated to a political campaign and that he felt a strong urge to do so.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere is so much optimism with the Kerry campaign,\u201d Bradstreet said. \u201cI kept an open mind with the Bush administration, but I have been nothing but disappointed.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Most of the volunteer staffers at the event were college students, including several from Harvard.

{"title": "Bush Stresses Safety in Acceptance Speech | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>NEW YORK\u2014George W. Bush accepted the Republican nomination for president last night, casting his first term in the shadow of the Sept. 11 attacks and defending his administration\u2019s tactics and policies in the war on terrorism.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIn the heart of this great city, we saw tragedy arrive on a quiet morning,\u201d Bush told thousands of flag-waving delegates at Madison Square Garden. \u201cSince that day, I wake up every morning thinking about how to better protect our country. I will never relent in defending America, whatever it takes.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Speaking just miles from Ground Zero, Bush repeatedly invoked the attacks of Sept. 11 and said he had spent the past three years making the world safer by defeating the Taliban in Afghanistan and toppling the government of Saddam Hussein in Iraq.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cFree societies in the Middle East will be hopeful societies, which no longer feed resentments and breed violence for export,\u201d Bush said.</span></p> <p><span>Laying forth his vision for a second term in office, the president said he would promote an \u201cownership society\u201d by reforming social security, expanding access to health care and making his tax cuts permanent.</span></p> <p><span>The president vowed to widen access to higher education, calling for greater funding of the federal government\u2019s beleaguered student aid program. \u201cBy raising performance in our high schools and expanding Pell grants for low- and middle-income families, we will help more Americans start their career with a college diploma,\u201d Bush said.</span></p> <p><span>Roughly 9 percent of Harvard undergraduates qualify for Pell grants, according to the Office of Financial Aid.</span></p> <p><span>Bush also touted his administration\u2019s signature education package, the No Child Left Behind Act, and said nationwide student testing would hold schools accountable for their performance.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe are insisting on accountability, empowering parents and teachers, and making sure that local people are in charge of their schools,\u201d Bush said, drawing some of the largest applause of the night.</span></p> <p><span>And in a brief but resolute section on values, the president took a pointed jab at the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts for its ruling last year that legalized gay marriage in the state. \u201cBecause the union of a man and woman deserves an honored place in our society, I support the protection of marriage against activist judges,\u201d Bush said.</span></p> <p><span>But Bush did not give mention to a proposed constitutional amendment banning gay marriage, which he supports.</span></p> <p><span>The president reflected upon the accomplishments of his first term in office, contrasting his record against that of his opponent, Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., whom Republicans have painted as inconsistent in his views.</span></p> <p><span>Speaking directly to the delegates assembled on the floor below him, Bush said, \u201cEven when we don\u2019t agree, at least you know what I believe in and where I stand.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Bush ripped into Kerry for what he said were the senator\u2019s \u201ctax-and-spend\u201d policies.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe\u2019s proposed more than two trillion dollars in new federal spending so far,\u201d Bush said, \u201cand that\u2019s a lot, even for a senator from Massachusetts.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The president addressed the gathering of delegates and supporters last night from a circular stage bearing the presidential seal. And as Bush made his entrance, a podium emerged from the floor in front of him.</span></p> <p><span>Convention organizers hoped to create a more intimate setting for the president\u2019s address. Still, nine steps and two barriers separated Bush from the crowd.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard students contacted immediately following the president\u2019s speech reacted along party lines.</span></p> <p><span>Matthew P. Downer \u201907, who spent the summer as an assistant in the convention\u2019s Office of External Relations and Program Committee, called Bush\u2019s speech a \u201cgrand slam.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe made a compelling case for another four years,\u201d said Downer, who watched the speech from the convention\u2019s plush red floor next to the Ohio delegation.</span></p> <p><span>And another Harvard Republican Club member and convention volunteer, Bryce E. Caswell \u201907, said she appreciated the president\u2019s sense of humor. In one lighthearted moment, Bush acknowledged his English has not always been up to par.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI knew I had a problem when Arnold Schwarzenegger started [correcting] it,\u201d Bush said.</span></p> <p><span>But Andy J. Frank \u201905, president of the Harvard College Democrats, remained unimpressed with the rhetoric of the Bush campaign.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe\u2019ve heard the same things that he said today about a billion times, but it doesn\u2019t make it true,\u201d Frank said by telephone after watching the speech from his home in Illinois.</span></p> <p><span>The College Democrats e-mailed a bulletin to members early this morning saying the president\u2019s speech had capped \u201cthe most hateful, venomous, and misleading convention in history.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>And in a sign of the heated opposition to Bush\u2019s first term in office, opponents of the president managed to infiltrate and disrupt the convention for the fourth night in a row. One woman, displaying a sign which read \u201cBush lies,\u201d was dragged away after she began shouting during the president\u2019s speech. A second protester was escorted out of the building minutes later, but not before forcing the president to pause his address briefly as delegates chanted \u201cFour more years\u201d to drown out the heckler.</span></p> <p><span>Security remained tight during the final night of the convention, but the crowd\u2019s nerves were rattled when, during the traditional balloon drop, streamers were unfurled with a bang, startling many in the arena.</span></p> <p><span>--Staff writer Zachary M.

People in New York don\u2019t have problems with the police. Voicing a large peaceful protest is a positive thing,\u201d he said over chants of \u201cDown with Bush!\u201d</span></p> <p><span>His undergraduate counterparts weren\u2019t demonstrating their Harvard affiliation quite so openly, but they were just as vocal about their opposition to President Bush\u2019s policies. \u201cWe\u2019re marching because we\u2019re Americans, and our future is at stake,\u201d said Michael A. Gould-Wartofsky \u201907, a national organizer for the National Youth Institute and Peace Coalition.</span></p> <p><span>The native New Yorker, cell phone in hand, wore a t-shirt emblazoned with a bust of Martin Luther King as he stood amidst dozens of student protesters in Columbus Circle, counting down until the start of the United for Peace &amp; Justice (UPJ) rally.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis is the only part of the week that\u2019s unscripted,\u201d said Gould-Wartofsky, who is also a Crimson editor. A mosaic of malcontents swirled around him: Jews Against Occupation; Young Feminists Mobilizing; Books Not Bombs. Gould-Wartofsky\u2019s own logo was more subtle: a Harvard Coop insignia, protruding from his back pocket in the form of a plastic bag.</span></p> <p><span>Just as it was difficult to gauge the size of the five-hour long march through Manhattan\u2019s Seventh Avenue\u2014estimates ranged from 200,000 to half a million\u2014it was hard to put a number on the Harvard faces in the crowd, most of whom wore neither Harvard t-shirts nor Coop bags. Student organizers said that up to 75 undergraduates participated.</span></p> <p><span>New Yorkers Adam S. Levine \u201905 and Daniel A. Stolz \u201907 carried a sign saying \u201cHarvard Says Bush Out: Peace and Freedom!\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe want to keep the RNC from hogging the spotlight,\u201d Levine said.</span></p> <p><span>Although emotions were running high throughout the day, the protest was largely peaceful. City officials were concerned that some demonstrators would attempt to continue past the Garden and into Central Park, which a federal judge ruled last week could not host a mass protest. Marchers instead turned east on 34th Street and returned downtown on Fifth Avenue, disassembling at Union Square as planned.</span></p> <p><span>Still, the march was not without incident. Anarchists set a green papier-m\u00e2che dragon on fire, but the flame was quickly extinguished.</span></p> <p><span>Over 200 arrests were made Sunday. Hundreds more were made today, and a 21-year-old Yale senior was charged with assaulting federal officers and impeding the operation of the Secret Service after he shouted anti-war statements and attempted to climb into Vice President Dick Cheney's convention box seat Monday night.</span></p> <p><span>The crowd ranged widely in age, class and gender. Protesters toted posters labeling Bush a terrorist, a murderer and a dictator. Slogans ran the gamut of good taste, from the innocuous \u201cNo More Years\u201d to the sign held by a bikini-clad marcher: \u201cGive this Bush a Brazilian.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Kerry-Edwards signs were noticeably absent from the march\u2014the Democratic challengers\u2019 blue-and-white logos were dwarfed by the green swath of vocal Ralph Nader and Green Party supporters. Several protesters said that while they were unenthusiastic about Kerry, they would vote for him as the only viable alternative to Bush.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe\u2019s the candidate\u2014we support him. Nobody likes him. He\u2019s part of the same system,\u201d said one protester from Brooklyn. \u201cBut there\u2019s a big difference\u2014Ashcroft and Rumsfeld.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Ben Kreider, a student at Bowdoin College, said he was moved to protest by concerns over conscription.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cA lot of young people are afraid of the draft. It\u2019s a real possibility,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>For others, protesting was their only political outlet. \u201cI think that one of the most important things is I am not 18,\u201d said Molly Birnbaum, 17, a senior at the Packer School in Brooklyn Heights. \u201cThis is the only way I have my say. This is my vote.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Several celebrities, including filmmaker Michael Moore, Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., and actor Danny Glover, also joined the protest. In a small rally before the march, they called for the return of American troops from Iraq.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cOne day someone will ask: When our world went crazy and lives were lost, what were you doing?\u201d Rangel said.</span></p> <p><span>But not everyone in the crowds that lined Seventh Avenue opposed President Bush\u2019s policies.</span></p> <p><span>As the carnival-esque parade inched past Madison Square Garden, a gathering of pro-life and pro-Bush demonstrators held a small counter-demonstration across from Penn Plaza, engaging several protesters in charged shouting matches. Some labeled the demonstrators \u201cbaby-killers\u201d; \u201cGo home, fascists!\u201d came the response.</span></p> <p><span>One Bush supporter wore a t-shirt declaring \u201cIslam supports Kerry.\u201d Underneath was the slogan, \u201cIntolerance is a beautiful thing.\u201d Another carried a sign scrawled with the words, \u201cTerrorists for Kerry.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Robert Ashby, a College Republican at Western Kentucky University who was rallying the counter-protesters, dismissed the anti-Bush activists as \u201cclosed-minded.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>A police officer watching over the protest said that he would vote for the President. \u201cI think he\u2019s doing what\u2019s best for the people.

{"title": "Why I'll Be in New York | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>TUCSON, Ariz.\u2014Dear President Bush:</span></p> <p><span>Ten years from now, I do not want to live in a world of random violence and endless war. If you continue pursuing your present policies in the \u201cwar on terror,\u201d I fear for the future. That is why next week I will be in New York City, protesting your party\u2019s nominating convention.</span></p> <p><span>I have decided to extend you the courtesy of a letter explaining myself\u2014although I am confident you will not read it. Likewise, I am resigned to the fact that you will surely ignore the hundreds of thousands of others who gather in the streets of New York next week. Your campaign has already indicated as much publicly. So why protest? And why write?</span></p> <p><span>No doubt the very fact that I am a protester makes it easy for you to write me off as an \u201cextremist\u201d\u2014a term your campaign seems fond of affixing to opponents these days. As a college student in Cambridge I, admittedly, fit the stereotype. But I am also a voter from the key swing state of Arizona, and I live in a congressional district which has voted for the same Republican since 1984. If I am an extremist, it is only in the sense that I care more deeply about the future of our country than most and fear more gravely the damage your reelection will entail.</span></p> <p><span>Your fundamentalist views of the world are one of the greatest threats to peace on the planet. Your administration\u2019s naive, militaristic, \u201cgood-versus-evil\u201d approach to fighting terrorism has been inadequate at best and seriously counterproductive at worst. Although some aspects of life in Afghanistan and Iraq have improved (and may potentially still), today they have become the rallying points and new training grounds for future terrorists worldwide. Although you like to boast on the campaign trail of the number of al Qaeda operatives arrested under your watch, the hard reality is that your deadly wars have been responsible for countless new terrorist factions, recruits and supporters. You have transformed the good will of the world following Sept. 11 into widespread ire and disgust.</span></p> <p><span>Do not misunderstand me: The enemies of the United States are real, and they are exceptionally determined. But they are people, human beings. The so-called \u201cwar on terror\u201d is not a battle against evil-incarnate. It should be a campaign to prevent desperate, angry people from taking up arms against us\u2014and when they do so to defend the world from their attacks. It should not be a war of preemption against a list of potential adversaries; it should be a program of crucial preemptive action against the poverty, ignorance and political oppression which create the conditions under which terrorist groups thrive.</span></p> <p><span>To be sure, many Americans feel safer knowing that the commander in chief sees the world as you do\u2014even those whose worldviews contain shades of gray. I know this because I have spoken with many of them, some of whom are close friends and family members. Many are Jews who have grown frustrated at the steady stream of terrorism in Israel. Others are New Yorkers, who witnessed first-hand the slaughtering of innocent fellow citizens. Still others, knowing nothing of terrorism beyond what they\u2019ve seen on TV, look to someone (anyone) resembling a strong leader in hopes that they\u2019ll keep them safe. Americans are afraid, and you have taken every opportunity to remind them why they should be.</span></p> <p><span>Despite the ineffectual and dangerous nature of your policies, many Americans dare not question your approach to fighting this war. (It helps, by the way, that the Democrats have so rarely provided any substantive alternatives.) Any opening, they say\u2014and you remind them\u2014will be exploited by our enemies. It is this paranoid logic which extended the Cold War decade after decade.</span></p> <p><span>Your view of the world prevents any substantive dialogue about why people resort to terrorism. No matter the extent to which we may agree that terrorism is wrong, it is simply insufficient to argue that terrorists become terrorists because they are evil. You may believe that\u2014and your policies certainly reflect that belief\u2014but in terms of making the world a safer place, that belief leads only toward the escalation of violence.</span></p> <p><span>And that is why I will be in New York.</span></p> <p><span>A friend asked me the other day what I hoped to accomplish by protesting. She pointed out, as I did above, that members of your party don\u2019t care what I have to say, and that even if they did, inevitably my message will get drowned out in the cacophony of dissent. Surely it is better to simply let the GOP convene in peace and go about my own business. She has a point.</span></p> <p><span>But 10 years from now I don\u2019t want to look back and chide myself for what more I could have done. I don\u2019t want to stop believing that maybe in our democracy, just maybe, you would hear our call.</span></p> <p><span><i>Benjamin J.

{"title": "Dear John | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>A poll in this week\u2019s <i>Time</i> Magazine shows that the relentless Swift Boat Veterans ads and the Republican National Convention\u2014a somewhat unprecedented incumbent convention, considering the amount of attention devoted to the weaknesses of the challenger\u2014have taken a toll on John F. Kerry. The poll shows President Bush leading Kerry 52 percent to 41 percent, with Kerry\u2019s favorability rating down from about 55 percent in August to 43 percent today.</span></p> <p><span>More surprising than the magnitude of Bush\u2019s bounce, however, is the fact that Kerry seems to be taking it sitting down. Rather than challenge the president with a slew of obvious and legitimate criticisms\u2014a costly war fought on what now appear to be false pretenses, an economy in recession, a nation hemorrhaging jobs, a $400 billion budget deficit\u2014Kerry seems to be trying to stay above it all, being elusive rather than clear, being hopelessly optimistic rather than perhaps fatally realistic. His most publicized statements, such as last week\u2019s promise to create a Department of Wellness to advocate preventive healthcare, beg the question posed by our friend Jon Stewart on \u201cThe Daily Show:\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Is he trying to lose?</span></p> <p><span>Considering his lifelong aspirations to the White House, that seems unlikely\u2014yet his strategy makes you wonder. This summer, C-Span aired an episode of \u201cThe Dick Cavett Show\u201d in 1971, showing a younger John F. Kerry debating his current Swift Boat rival John O\u2019Neill on Vietnamization and how to end the War. The Kerry of 1971 paradoxically makes the Kerry of today look like an amateur. He was poised as always without sacrificing vitality; he was sharp and in command, and he seized every opportunity to quietly take his opponent to the cleaners. His nuance wasn\u2019t a burden to his effectiveness; rather, it was captivating. He embodied the feeling of inevitability that has followed his aspirations for the White House; perhaps he was too cocksure, too patrician, but he was clear in his convictions. Today the passionate youth seems to have given way to a flabbier, saggier candidacy.</span></p> <p><span>That was, of course, before he lost his first race; he never lost again, but the mid-campaign scare was somewhat institutionalized. Kerry has a reputation in Massachusetts for stumbling through the middle of the campaign and then emerging victoriously from the trainwreck unscathed, like a political Mr. Magoo (see his Senate campaign against Governor William Weld \u201966). For those of us in his corner, I suppose that counts as consolation.</span></p> <p><span>Kerry\u2019s lack of response and attack seems to stem from a philosophy that a negative candidacy is doomed to fail\u2014and that optimism is key. A positive message is certainly worthwhile, but not at the expense of self-defense and a potentially dangerous inability to criticize the chief executive\u2019s judgment. Optimism is all well and good, but Kerry is running for president, not head cheerleader. His pal Bill Clinton is right: Strength and wisdom are not opposing values. But it certainly would be stupid not to show a little more strength.</span></p> <p><span><b> </b></span></p> <p><span><i>Peter C.

Gould-Wartofsky \u201907, a national organizer for the National Youth Institute and Peace Coalition.</span></p> <p><span>The native New Yorker, cell phone in hand, wore a t-shirt emblazoned with a bust of Martin Luther King as he stood amidst dozens of student protesters in Columbus Circle, counting down until the start of the United for Peace &amp; Justice (UPJ) rally.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis is the only part of the week that\u2019s unscripted,\u201d said Gould-Wartofsky, who is also a Crimson editor. A mosaic of malcontents swirled around him: Jews Against Occupation; Young Feminists Mobilizing; Books Not Bombs. Gould-Wartofsky\u2019s own logo was more subtle: a Harvard Coop insignia, protruding from his back pocket in the form of a plastic bag.</span></p> <p><span>Just as it was difficult to gauge the size of the five-hour long march through Manhattan\u2019s Seventh Avenue\u2014estimates ranged from 200,000 to half a million\u2014it was hard to put a number on the Harvard faces in the crowd, most of whom wore neither Harvard t-shirts nor Coop bags.

Several protesters said that while they were unenthusiastic about Kerry, they would vote for him as the only viable alternative to Bush.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe\u2019s the candidate\u2014we support him.

It\u2019s a real possibility,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>For others, protesting was their only political outlet. \u201cI think that one of the most important things is I am not 18,\u201d said Molly Birnbaum, 17, a senior at the Packer School in Brooklyn Heights. \u201cThis is the only way I have my say. This is my vote.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Several celebrities, including filmmaker Michael Moore, Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., and actor Danny Glover, also joined the protest. In a small rally before the march, they called for the return of American troops from Iraq.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cOne day someone will ask: When our world went crazy and lives were lost, what were you doing?\u201d Rangel said.</span></p> <p><span>But not everyone in the crowds that lined Seventh Avenue opposed President Bush\u2019s policies.</span></p> <p><span>As the carnival-esque parade inched past Madison Square Garden, a gathering of pro-life and pro-Bush demonstrators held a small counter-demonstration across from Penn Plaza, engaging several protesters in charged shouting matches. Some labeled the demonstrators \u201cbaby-killers\u201d; \u201cGo home, fascists!\u201d came the response.</span></p> <p><span>One Bush supporter wore a t-shirt declaring \u201cIslam supports Kerry.\u201d Underneath was the slogan, \u201cIntolerance is a beautiful thing.\u201d Another carried a sign scrawled with the words, \u201cTerrorists for Kerry.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Robert Ashby, a College Republican at Western Kentucky University who was rallying the counter-protesters, dismissed the anti-Bush activists as \u201cclosed-minded.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>A police officer watching over the protest said that he would vote for the president. \u201cI think he\u2019s doing what\u2019s best for the people.

Bush\u2019s key to victory is not to say anything at all.</span></p> <p><span>Four years ago, Bush campaigned with a populist message\u2014just as selectively applied then as it is now\u2014to govern in a way that respected the rights of the people to make their own choices.  He smirked and did that eyebrow thing and said famously (not to mention falsely), \u201cMy opponent trusts the government; I trust the people.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Thus it may come as a bit of a surprise (or not at all) that when Bush rolled out the new central plank in his platform at the Republican National Convention this month\u2014a revamping of the entire federal tax code\u2014he didn\u2019t bother to fill anyone in on the details. It\u2019s too messy. Too inefficient. There are too many corporate loopholes. All true. Trouble is: what does he intend to do about it? Trust us, he said. Re-elect us, and we\u2019ll take care of it.</span></p> <p><span>Whatever happened to trusting the people?</span></p> <p><span>Thanks, but no thanks, Mr. President. After four years of acting like lap dogs for corporate America, ramming through tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, pushing for an end to capital gains taxes, and burning through a record surplus, I think we know what to expect when we trust the Bush government to take care of things.</span></p> <p><span>But let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves. Let\u2019s examine the few scraps of information that Bush has been kind enough to share about his plans. In his acceptance speech, Bush reflected on his desire to bring about \u201ca simpler, fairer, pro-growth\u201d tax system. And he promises to do it a \u201cbipartisan\u201d manner\u2014appointing a panel of experts and economists who will advise his Treasury Secretary about bold new options for revamping the code in a revenue-neutral way (remember, after all, there is that pesky deficit).</span></p> <p><span>So far so good, right? Who doesn\u2019t like bipartisanship? And why shouldn\u2019t we trust a bunch of economists to rewrite the code?</span></p> <p><span>Well, for one thing, taxes aren\u2019t only about drags on the economy. It\u2019s also about making judgment calls about who should foot the bill, about what is money earned versus money happened upon, about where the burden of funding the federal government ought to lie. (Those of us who took Ec 10 probably remember that lecture on the difference between positive and normative statements.)</span></p> <p><span>But regardless of these broader matters, there is also that little inconvenient fact that this administration already has a pretty good idea of how it would like to change the system. Streamlining the code was once a pet project of Treasury Secretary Paul O\u2019Neill\u2014that is, of course, before he was canned. The Bush-Cheney campaign\u2014or more likely that wily Karl Rove\u2014just doesn\u2019t feel like talking about it.</span></p> <p><span>But as University President Lawrence H. Summers demonstrated this past year with reference to Allston planning, you don\u2019t ask a committee for ideas without first framing their choices with a few \u201cplanning assumptions.\u201d And it\u2019s fairly clear to those who\u2019ve followed this story line in the media what planning assumptions this tax policy committee will be charged with. This talk about bipartisanship and economists obscures the fact that the Bush team knows exactly the direction it\u2019s heading. For several weeks now there have been quiet (and not so quiet) rumblings from the Bush-Cheney politburo about that perennial conservative darling\u2014the \u201cflat tax.\u201d And this talk about corporate loopholes? Not unless Corporate America\u2019s getting something in return\u2014and no doubt they would be.</span></p> <p><span>But the Bush-Cheney campaign wouldn\u2019t actually stoop so high as to take a position! That would leave them open to criticism\u2014for instance, like the (accurate) claim that a flat tax is basically yet another ginormous tax cut for the wealthy. No, it\u2019s far better to talk generally about cleaning up a headache-inducing system\u2014about ending corporate loopholes\u2014than to endorse any specific plan. This has Karl Rove\u2019s fingerprints all over it. As long as Bush paints this plank in broad-brush strokes, he\u2019s got a sure winner on his hands.</span></p> <p><span>The truth is Bush\u2019s vague domestic policy agenda is the biggest fraud on the American public since Richard Nixon campaigned on a secret plan to end the Vietnam War. This latest vacuous ploy makes previous Bush policy announcements pale in comparison. While we\u2019ve come to expect our president to disingenuously pander leftward while lurching ever farther right\u2014think outdoorsy photo-ops for the ill-named Healthy Forest Initiative, which opened up 20 million acres of National Forests to logging and made them more susceptible to fires\u2014this time the Republicans aren\u2019t even bothering to put a proposal on the table. That way, whenever anyone criticizes it, they can reply, \u201cDon\u2019t be so critical; nothing\u2019s been decided yet.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Of course, will anyone fall for it? After all, this is the same president who allowed oil tycoons to create his energy policy. And now we are to believe\u2014on faith alone\u2014that when Bush sits down to rewrite the tax code, the only interests on his mind will be the average \u201cfolks\u201d he\u2019s met on the trail.</span></p> <p><span>Mr. President, if you still trust the people, then let us in on your secret plan. Give us the facts; we\u2019ll promise to make our choice wisely.</span></p> <p><span><i>Benjamin J.

Bush supporter Zell Miller any angrier about those cynical political flip-floppers. But for all the Democratic whining\u2014and Republican chest-puffing\u2014over the \u201cinconsistent\u201d label now affixed to John Kerry\u2019s forehead, on the central economic appeal of his campaign Kerry has proven his attackers wrong.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe will stop the Benedict Arnold CEOs your taxes reward for shipping jobs overseas,\u201d Kerry would promise, in between preppy-on-preppy swipes at Howard Dean, late last year. Now neutralized of its primary season pungence, that message\u2014leveraging the tax code (doing something!) to encourage American companies to retain their relatively expensive domestic labor\u2014remains at the heart of Kerry\u2019s candidacy.</span></p> <p><span>Kerry is consistent on outsourcing for a reason: more American workers are more worried than ever.</span></p> <p><span>No longer is it just the blue-collar workforce\u2014the Midwestern hardhats, the Southern millers, the Rustbelt miners\u2014who watch their plants close and their jobs replaced because foreign labor is cheaper. Now, we are told, it is all of us whose (future) jobs are at risk. Or, more precisely, it is every service sector worker who need not appear in person: today\u2019s Bangalore customer service callers could become tomorrow\u2019s investment bankers.</span></p> <p><span>Back in the seventies, when outsourcing only happened to muscle jobs, the solution was simple: job skills. Get some information age training and get an information age job. But today\u2019s problem is trickier. Thanks to the communications revolution, millions of better educated, lower paid Indian and Chinese workers can compete for American white-collar jobs\u2014our jobs. And they can win.</span></p> <p><span>Kerry isn\u2019t the only former trade liberalizer to respond. The economist-class orthodoxy that, for America, unrestricted trade is always more positive than negative, is under attack from fellow free market wonks. From people like Paul Samuelson! People whose opinions don\u2019t normally cause their names to end in exclamation marks.</span></p> <p><span>Samuelson, the Nobel laureate and MIT economics professor emeritus, told The New York Times that, on trade, fellow economists are \u201cdead wrong about the necessary surplus of winnings over losings.\u201d And what of the economic benefit of lower priced goods for American consumers? \u201cBeing able to purchase groceries 20 percent cheaper at Wal-mart does not necessarily make up for the wage losses.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Now, let\u2019s get real. Nobody is proposing punitive taxes or tariffs on foreign competition. Nobody is sure that new fears about what Ross Perot used to call \u201cthe sucking sound\u201d of jobs sent abroad will actually be realized. Jagdish Bhagwati, a Columbia economics professor and former Samuelson student, responded to his old mentor\u2019s concern with unshakeable\u2014and, thus far, defensible\u2014faith in American innovation to hold most jobs here.</span></p> <p><span>Which brings us back to Kerry: To the credit of a candidate laboring against appearing \u201cnuanced,\u201d he has always avoided the straightforward (but disingenuous) political response to lost jobs: various forms of a wall around America.</span></p> <p><span>Many of the reporters who cover campaigns, shall we say, swim in the shallow end of the pool\u2014and have, consequently, missed this. But what Kerry has consistently offered\u2014beyond a (relatively minor) corporate tax restructuring, and an underreported (but dramatic) new focus on math and science education\u2014is the beginning of an economic competitiveness agenda actually worthy of the next American president. A president who realizes that, in many ways, the world isn\u2019t divided between good and evil, but between those getting ahead and those falling behind\u2014and that it is every country\u2019s responsibility to offer opportunity at home, with America leading the way.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAmericans have seen plants closed down, jobs shipped overseas and our hopes fade away as our economic position collapses right before our very eyes. And George Bush does not get it.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Said Zell Miller, the last time a Republican president ran for re-election.</span></p> <p><span>On addressing (and at least recognizing) the consequences of an economy in transition, John Kerry has been consistent.

{"title": "An Assault on Democracy | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>As of today, semi-automatic assault weapons are once again legal in the United States\u2014and all Americans are less secure as a result.</span></p> <p><span>Ten years after President Clinton signed the assault weapons ban, which had extensive bipartisan support, the bill has met a quiet and bitter end under a new president and a new Congress. The bill had applied to weapons including the AK-47, Kalashnikov and Uzi rifles, as well as guns with certain combinations of features such as a pistol grip, folding or telescoping stock, and others. The weapons may be available for purchase\u2014and back on the streets\u2014by the end of the week.</span></p> <p><span>The ban is ending, not because it is unpopular or unnecessary, but because of a failure of the democratic process, because of the influence of a hugely powerful special interest group on national politics. Despite significant popular support (a July study by the Consumer Federation of America and the Educational Fund to Stop Gun Violence found that 72 percent of Midwestern voters, as well as 81 percent of likely voters in Florida, support the ban), despite support from notable police chiefs nationwide, and despite President Bush\u2019s own public backing for the ban, the Republican Congress has refused to allow a vote on a bill which would extend the law.</span></p> <p><span>Lobbyists for the National Rifle Association, who insist that the public is not in fact in favor of the ban, have argued that the law has huge loopholes. Indeed, some gun manufacturers have been producing weapons with slight cosmetic changes to sidestep the intent of the law. Senate Majority Leader Tom Delay, R.-Texas, has derided the ban as an ineffective \u201cfeel-good piece of legislation.\u201d To be sure, whatever ambiguity existing in the current legislation is problematic. But the existence of loopholes is not an argument for throwing out the ban altogether; it is an argument for strengthening the law to close the loopholes.</span></p> <p><span>Still, the most shameful aspect of this entire ordeal is the way in which President Bush has attempted to reap political benefits from both sides of the issue. While publicly calling for an extension to the popular ban, with a wink and a nod to the gun lobby Bush has refused to lift a finger to persuade Congress. He prefers to blame Congress for their inaction, but the true blame lies with his own insincerity.</span></p> <p><span>Earlier this month, at the Republican National Convention, the GOP tried to portray this president as a strong and steady leader, but such a leader would stand by his or her words. Such a leader would match rhetoric with action.

{"title": "There's No Place Like School | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>A year ago, I was a field organizer for the highly successful, people-powered campaign of the next President of the United States, former Vermont Governor Howard Dean. What a difference a year makes.</span></p> <p><span>It all started thirteen years ago in Santa Fe, New Mexico. My parents have always been \u201cactivists.\u201d For most of my life they have worked, in one capacity or another, for labor unions and the workers who join them. Thirteen years ago, they took me to my first picket line. The strikers I walked with won their struggle, and ever since, I have been, as my parents would say, \u201cIn The Movement.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The Movement is a funny thing to join. It doesn\u2019t have any official members. It doesn\u2019t have a clubhouse or even a union hall. In high school, being in the Movement meant arguing for gay rights at school board meetings, working for labor unions in the summer and taking a train to Philadelphia to protest the Republican National Convention and getting run over by nearsighted bike cops. The Movement became my motivation. I wasn\u2019t the kind of blind ideologue you see screaming and cussing at city council meetings or Bush speeches. I chose The Movement the way some of my classmates decided to become doctors. It seemed like a good and valuable way to spend my life.</span></p> <p><span>When I got to Harvard, school seemed like a good way to stay in The Movement. I could learn about public policy, study how the political system works and do a little campus activism to tide me over until graduation. Maybe it\u2019s just the people I know, but I think a lot of people look at Harvard the way I did. They may not be motivated by politics and activism the way I am, but they see Harvard as a tool, a path to something else, whether that something else is medical school, an I-banking job or a more humane world.</span></p> <p><span>I enjoyed my first year at school, but Harvard seemed like an imperfect tool. I learned about public policy and politics; I even participated in my share of campus activism. But I was torn. I liked to party. I liked to make midnight trips to the Kong and play roller hockey in the hallway of my dorm. Harvard offered millions of opportunities to be part of The Movement, and I felt guilty when I turned down one of those opportunities to enjoy the pleasant distractions of college life.</span></p> <p><span>The Dean campaign was my chance to immerse myself in The Movement. When I decided to take a semester off, I was looking forward to fully devoting myself to a cause, without the distractions of college life. It is difficult to explain the way a campaign takes over your life. It\u2019s not just the 15-hour days (which tend to become 18 or 20-hour days by the end). It\u2019s not just the lack of days off, or the fact that you rarely know anybody outside of the campaign. You get so caught up in the excitement of the campaign that it becomes your entire reason for being. Every interaction\u2014from ordering a burger to waving to another driver on the street\u2014becomes part of the campaign. You start to check out girls on the street and think: \u201cDamn! I\u2019ll bet she\u2019d be a really effective canvasser.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The Dean campaign, as some of the Governor\u2019s detractors have pointed out, was more intense than most. None of us came for a nice, stable job. None of us came because Dean seemed like a safe bet. When most of our New Hampshire staff signed on, the press agreed that Dean would be the Democratic nominee right after the Red Sox won the World Series and Ann Coulter won the First Annual Hell-Wide Snowball Fight. The Dean campaign was all about the love. It was The Movement.</span></p> <p><span>In many ways, the Dean campaign was a quintessential Harvard experience. So many Harvard students find their purpose in the clubs that sprout up every year on our campus or in the life aspirations that they formed long before they got to Cambridge. So many think of themselves as activists (or premeds or future businessmen) before they think of themselves as students. College life\u2014everything from late night discussions with roommates to pissing on John Harvard\u2019s foot\u2014can seem like a distraction. Harvard often feels like a bus station, filled with brilliant people on their way somewhere else, too restless to enjoy where they are. The Dean campaign was my way of getting where I was going before I finished school. I got to strip away the distractions of being a student and be who I thought I was: an activist, pure and simple.</span></p> <p><span>Even when I got back to school last semester, I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that I should be out in the \u201creal world,\u201d fighting for something. I was back at Harvard, but I still felt like I was on the campaign. I wrote papers on the Dean campaign; I tried to live through my friends who were still on the campaign; and I still thought of myself as an activist, not a student.</span></p> <p><span>But The Movement is not all there is. I still believe people my age should be involved in politics. I plan to spend my fall working to get rid of George W. Bush. But I have two and a half more years at this place, and I want to enjoy them. I want to experience college life in all its beer-stained, sleep-deprived, grease-soaked glory. I want to look at my friends as friends, not potential allies. I want to go to parties to dance and drink (coffee, of course) and meet people, not to find future comrades or plot strategy for the next action. I love The Movement. But for now I am a student, and it\u2019s good to be back.</span></p> <p><span><i>Sam M. Simon \u201906, a Crimson editor, is a social studies concentrator in Eliot House.</i></span></p>"}
{"title": "Full Circle | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Every few decades there is realignment in American politics. Parties\u2019 platforms undergo significant changes, as do the self-impressions of their members. With the presidential election near, the positions and themes adopted by the Democrats and Republicans hint that such a shift is beginning to take place.</span></p> <p><span>Before current Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry, the biographies of the last two Democratic presidential candidates were woefully lacking in any sort of military accomplishment. Far too much has been written already about Clinton\u2019s draft dodging and Al Gore\u2019s \u201cfront-line\u201d reporting, and I will not devolve into tired character attacks. While neither man could be accused of dereliction of duty or outright cowardice, it was certainly true that they preferred to focus on domestic concerns at the expense of foreign policy and military issues. Their contrast with Kerry in this respect is remarkable. Can anyone imagine either Clinton or Gore  \u201cReporting for duty,\u201d as Kerry did during his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention.</span></p> <p><span>The old Democratic penchant for sidestepping military matters makes Kerry\u2019s all-out focus on his Vietnam record all the more interesting. Only a year ago, in the midst of Howard Dean\u2019s fifteen minutes of fame, the likelihood that the eventual Democratic presidential nominee would be a decorated soldier seemed remote. Indeed, the spectacle of tens of thousands of passionate leftist Democrats cheering someone\u2019s Vietnam service as \u201cnoble\u201d seemed a sight about as likely as Dick Cheney attending a MoveOn.org block party. One is tempted to ask people when the Vietnam War became something to brag about, but that is missing the point. When all is said and done John Kerry went to Vietnam, and his experience has provided enough biographical ammunition, if wielded capably, to deflect most any charges that he is weak, inept or inexperienced.</span></p> <p><span>The Republicans are not immune from this sort of thing; many of their talking-points seem as though they were taken straight out of a \u201cGore-Lieberman 2000\u201d pamphlet. In the midst of the \u201cRepublican revolution,\u201d with Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga,  in charge and government agencies such as the Department of Education in real danger of being axed, who would have guessed that the next Republican president\u2019s main domestic accomplishments would be more educational spending, a new Cabinet-level agency, and a new Medicare entitlement? And who would have thought that Bush\u2019s prime international accomplishment would be precisely the kind of \u201cnation building\u201d for which he once mocked Gore? Bush is now running an ad that unapologetically brags about increasing the number of democracies, whereas just a few years ago he thought this was largely none of our business.</span></p> <p><span>In yet another interesting reversal of expected positions, the Republicans are the ones favoring radical changes to the status quo in all sorts of situations. Republicans now want to remove large numbers of troops from Germany and South Korea, democratize the Middle East, follow the \u201cBush doctrine\u201d of preemption, and amend the constitution to ban gay-marriage. While not textbook \u201cliberal\u201d positions, these policies are nonetheless very serious changes to the status quo. \u201cLiberal\u201d can have all sorts of different meanings, but in modern American parlance it has come to denote someone who is left wing\u2014someone who favors changing existing arrangements. Likewise the typical definition of \u201cconservative\u201d is someone who tends rightwards, someone who favors retaining the existing government structures.   So it\u2019s surprising that \u201cliberal\u201d Democrats have been reflexively defending existing arrangements: the party has been busy fighting charter schools, battling social security privatization, preaching cooperation with our allies, advocating greater U.N. involvement, and eschewing involvement in Iraq and the Middle East. Perhaps the time has come for a realignment in the terms we use to describe the two parties. Anti-Bush protestors marching in New York won\u2019t suddenly be seen wearing \u201cW\u201d hats, nor will they flock to reelect Bush. Nevertheless, the Democratic party is acting to maintain the status quo in America while their Young Republican counterparts are seeking to change many of our country\u2019s institutions.</span></p> <p><span>The sorts of changes we are seeing are not just examples of the \u201cmove to the center\u201d that government texts so assuredly predict in two party presidential systems like our own. The contradiction in this presidential election\u2014Democrats favoring \u201cmuscular internationalism\u201d Republicans preaching \u201cCompassion\u201d\u2014reflects not merely the usual slide to the center, but a profound confusion in our country as a whole. Americans are stuck in a Blue State-Red State rut and profess a deep division over just about everything. The past two presidential campaigns were particularly good indicators of this growing polarization. In practice, all of this means that American political parties are getting harder and harder to label.</span></p> <p><span>But the posturing of Republicans and Democrats is symptomatic of a larger identity crisis within America. We seem, as a country, to be searching for our role in a very rapidly changing world, in which we are, for now, the only superpower. There is very little margin for error, and new challenges are constantly arising. Regardless of which party wins in November, or whether America follows a Republican, Democratic, Liberal, or Conservative path, our increasingly volatile and realigned political system will be saddled with real dangers that can\u2019t be easily addressed with polling, platforms or sound bites.</span></p> <p><span><i>Mark A.

{"title": "War of Words | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Constant wisecracks about President Bush\u2019s lack of eloquence belie how the President asserts power through his vocabulary. His seeming inattention to language is probably a symptom of contemporary society\u2019s general disinterest in words. This is evident in the sloppy communications even of students at a University like ours. Yet words do influence the interlocutors who use them, in often imperceptible but significant ways. Concepts which, when explained explicitly, we would refuse, penetrate our consciousness through their repetition as popular expressions and grow to become categories of our thought. Dismayingly, even speakers with the privilege of education are deceived by these linguistic Trojan horses.</span></p> <p><span>Some deployments of rhetoric are all too obvious. This year\u2019s refusal by prominent US government officials to label the events at the Abu Ghraib prison as \u201ctorture\u201d was terrible\u2014yet all too predictable. The chosen alternative, \u201cabuse,\u201d dismisses what occurred between torturer and victim, aggressor and prey. The infamous National Security Strategy document of September 2002, which championed pre-emptive attacks, worked analogously. The text avoids mention of human rights but rather sanctions \u201chuman dignity,\u201d which it loosely defines. This slippery concept lacks the half-century of experience and authority that has flowed into the doctrine of human rights, and indicates an escape, even on a conceptual level, from responsibilities formerly accepted by the Unites States.</span></p> <p><span>Thus far, the rhetorical devices are easy to diagnose, simply canny use of language by a government disinterested in engaging problematic issues. Other strategies are rapidly becoming less obvious, and thus more troubling, as they gain widespread use. The expression \u201cwar on terror\u201d should in theory surprise many: it describes war against an abstraction, against a feeling. It is utter nonsense. A war on terror cannot be won; it implies endless opponents and a population in a constant state of alert. Bush himself said as much in an Aug. 30 NBC interview.</span></p> <p><span>After criticism from the Democrats, the president was forced to backtrack, restating his earlier opinion that the US will win the war on terror. Instead of alarming many for its implicit agenda, the phrase has forcefully asserted itself to become part of our normal way of reading the world. Supporters of Democratic presidential candidate John F. Kerry protest that Bush will never win the war on terror with his current policies, or that Kerry would be better in the war on terror. Yet the President must have already won something, if his \u201cwar\u201d\u2014more reminiscent of the permanent war in Orwell\u2019s 1984 than any non-fictional conflict\u2014has become a universally accepted term for describing the current international situation.</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps Americans were open to the \u201cwar on terror\u201d because of their conversance with the war metaphor. Recent years have borne such concepts as the \u201cwar on drugs,\u201d the \u201cscience wars\u201d and the \u201cFreud wars,\u201d numbing us all to the strength and literal meaning of the word \u201cwar.\u201d Referring to this problem, philosopher of science Ian Hacking wrote a few years ago, \u201cMetaphors influence the mind in many unnoticed ways. The willingness to describe fierce disagreement in terms of the metaphors of war makes the very existence of real wars seem more natural, more inevitable, more a part of the human condition. It also betrays us into an insensibility toward the very idea of war, so that we are less prone to be aware of how totally disgusting real wars really are.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The \u201cwar on terror\u201d was just another step in this development, but with a difference: Unlike other metaphors, the \u201cwar on terror\u201d engenders real conflicts in which real American citizens die. Yet to most, it is impossible to conceive of the present without the concept.</span></p> <p><span>Part of this feeling of inevitability stems from the way in which that disparate collective we call \u201cthe media\u201d picks up on these expressions and repeats them endlessly, circumscribing our understanding of world events in narrow ways. The word \u201cmedia\u201d itself is a pervasive expression that cheats us of a better conceptualization of its object, particularly important as our source of information about the world. Originally the plural of medium, Latin simply for middle, mean, \u201cmedia\u201d in its current usage is specifically derived from the expression mass medium, to define phenomena such as radio, television and newspapers. A sentence beginning with \u201cthe media,\u201d then, is a sloppy generalization about a motley assortment of corporations, individuals and institutions and their journalistic activity.</span></p> <p><span>What is more, the word is inappropriately and significantly treated as a singular form, such as in the statement that \u201cthe media has a liberal bias.\u201d The idea that \u201cthe media\u201d is a single entity is borne to us through the vector of language. If we were concentrating, would we really choose to refer to the totality of mass communication as if it were guided by a single will? Perhaps current usage of \u201cthe media\u201d (sing.) is a symptom of the trend towards nation-wide uniformity spearheaded by Michael Powell\u2019s rampant FCC deregulation, which has stunted local programming and brought even the likes of Ted Turner to public protest.</span></p> <p><span>When we give up caring about the words we utter, we forsake our conceptual accuracy as well as the capacity to successfully resist a rising tide of equivocal expressions. John Kerry is clearly a victim of this phenomenon, so far failing to develop a language of his own. Without a way of cogently expressing his worldview, Kerry is forced to unconvincingly convey his plans through terminology coined by the current administration. Little wonder that he ends up sounding confused, or rather just vague and lacking substance. Next time the media reports on abuse in the war on terror, stop to ponder the \u201cwar\u201d of words.</span></p> <p><span><i>Alexander Bevilacqua \u201907, a Crimson editor, is a history and literature concentrator in Leverett House.</i></span></p>"}
{"title": "The Bush War Record Controversy | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Conservatives countrywide are congratulating themselves for unearthing yet another case of blatant bias in the ever-liberal media. After a Sept. 8 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d episode featured dubious documents regarding President Bush\u2019s service in the Texas Air National Guard, Republican bloggers and pundits have excoriated CBS News for sloppy journalism. And, predictably, the media attention afforded to this presidential race got even more issue-light as controversy swirled around the documents\u2019 authenticity.</span></p> <p><span>While first vehemently defending the documents, last week the network\u2019s brass\u2014including Dan Rather himself\u2014issued statements admitting that the documents were of questionable authenticity, if not questionable content. Apparently, the memos included evidence that Bush\u2019s commander was pressured to \u201csugar coat\u201d the president\u2019s profile and cited other blemishes on Bush\u2019s record; however, after obtaining the opinion of numerous experts, it appears that the memos were most likely written on a typeface not available on the antiquated typewriters of the 1970s\u2014suggesting scandal. Yet, according to an Associated Press article, \u201c[t]he news division continued to insist that the general thrust of the documents was accurate: that a commander felt Mr. Bush had been shirking his duties and receiving preferential treatment because of his connections.\u201d Now there\u2019s a surprise.</span></p> <p><span>This past February, after the public received the good news that the commander-in-chief had spent a valorous 82 days in the National Guard\u2014courtesy of dusty microfiche files released by the White House\u2014there was immediate controversy. It seemed Bush was paid for those nearly three months of service, yet his actual attendance was highly debated.</span></p> <p><span>What these new documents, authentic or not, bring to light is really inconsequential. The gist of Bush\u2019s record is quite clear. Rather than devote any more time to this overwrought scrutiny of war records\u2014of both Bush and Kerry\u2014it\u2019s time for the media and the public to focus on a record that is really important; that is, their respective records as public servants. But instead of focusing on substantive debate on the candidates\u2019 political records, it seems that the media cannot ignore the lure of sensation. The major news networks\u2019 excessive concentration on the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth\u2019s crusade to mar Kerry\u2019s courageous Vietnam record this summer and their continued focus on these suspect documents now demonstrate a frustrating disregard for solid coverage of real issues.</span></p> <p><span>Of course, a media network as powerful and pervasive as CBS ought to be held accountable for its reporting, ensuring that any information it receives\u2014and broadcasts\u2014is authentic. But a presidential election that could radically change the course of the country is looming. Without more media coverage of topics that really matter\u2014issues more vital than whether Bush skipped out of service or if Kerry\u2019s war medals were merited\u2014America\u2019s voting public will be left uniformed and unprepared come November.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Reflections on Protesting | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>By Benjamin J. Toff</span></p> <p><span>Like so many other students and activists, workers and professionals, I went to New York for the Republican National Convention. I went as a concerned citizen to protest the policies of a political party whose divisive and reckless platform troubles me deeply. And although it was invigorating to participate directly in a democratic process which has become so stilted and stale, I came away from New York with a restless unease about the ability of individuals to effect change in this day and age.</span></p> <p><span>The protests began on an incredibly uplifting note. On Sunday I marched to Madison Square Garden alongside 500,000 people in a procession that lasted hours into the afternoon. The march was entirely peaceful\u2014with the exception of the giant paper dragon that went up in flames. We were united in our rising frustration with the Bush administration and our genuine fear of the consequences of its actions. There was nothing but hope and enthusiasm in the eyes of everyone I saw. Even the police officers lining the streets were exceptionally calm and relaxed (at least that day). It seemed impossible that the Republicans could arrive in New York and delude themselves into believing they were in any sense welcome. The eyes of the world were upon us. And for that fleeting moment Sunday, it felt as though we might actually change the world.</span></p> <p><span>It didn\u2019t take long for my optimism to fade. On Tuesday, the Republican rhetoric took a sharp turn toward the sanctimonious. Former New York Mayor Rudolph Guliani exclaimed in his speech, \u201cThank God that George Bush is our president.\u201d My jaw dropped when he insisted that Bush\u2019s reelection was somehow intimately tied to properly remembering the thousands who perished three years ago: \u201cWe owe that much and more to the loved ones and heroes that we lost on September 11,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>It wasn\u2019t so much the callous way the Republican Party exploited the city of New York as an emotional backdrop for political gain that disturbed me. It wasn\u2019t so much Sen. Zell Miller\u2019s angry proclamation that to dissent from President Bush in this time of war is tantamount to treason that bothered me. It wasn\u2019t even the smilingly dishonest way Bush rewrote his past three years to relate a satisfying portrait of resolute strength and triumph that was upsetting. It was that the Republicans were so damn good at it. The 500,000 of us who had taken to the streets that week could never and would never match the power of the Bush administration\u2019s public relations staff.</span></p> <p><span>On Wednesday of convention week, my friends and I stumbled upon an RNC photo-op at a small park in Chinatown. Republican delegates were working alongside local residents to \u201cclean up\u201d the park, which had been closed temporarily in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 tragedy. They were almost outnumbered by members of the media eager to photograph and report on the morning\u2019s pseudo-event. The \u201cclean up,\u201d as far as we could observe, was a farce, consisting mostly of sweeping and raking the handful of leaves that had gathered and clumped in the grass over the summer.</span></p> <p><span>Still, as part of the G.O.P.\u2019s efforts to showcase their compassionate side, it was a useful spectacle. No matter how silly and insincere it appeared, the photo-op also effectively combined message propagation with real action. Sure, the usefulness of the \u201cclean-up\u201d was probably miniscule, but ultimately there was some positive action at its core. They were helping to clean up a park. And that was more than we could say about ourselves as protesters.</span></p> <p><span>What did we have to show for our week of shouting and marching? We had performed no valuable public service. Marching was too easy; the police and the protests\u2019 sponsors did most of the work anyhow, blocking traffic and setting up the routes. The obvious planning that had gone into these organized events wore on their symbolism. We protestors were apparently not angry enough to match the rowdiness of our Vietnam-era counterparts. Meanwhile, what spontaneous disturbances did crop up often served to alienate voters. Collectively, it was quite possible that we hadn\u2019t convinced a single person to vote any differently.</span></p> <p><span>No. In truth, these protests were not really about convincing people\u2014and they never had been. They were about affirming our own frustrations far more than they had ever been about persuading anyone else to think differently. And that\u2019s okay.</span></p> <p><span>A former teacher recently sent me a Native American short story called \u201cThe Return.\u201d It\u2019s about a man who leaves his village for years, only to return and find that the warmth and sharing and openness of his old home has been replaced with jealousy, greed and distrust. In desperation, he wanders the town shouting and asking what has happened to his village. But the people do not hear him. They dismiss him as a crazy old man; children taunt him.</span></p> <p><span>After twenty years, one day a young man approaches him and asks why he bothers to keep shouting: \u201cCan\u2019t you see that nothing has changed. The people still lie and cheat and steal and hate, and for all your shouting and all your tears, you have accomplished nothing.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The old man replies, \u201cI do not shout my message to change this world. I shout my message so that this world will not change me.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In that sense, the protests in New York were an unqualified success. I think all of us who went are glad we did and feel strongly that we needed to go as a matter of personal conscience. Years from now, we want to be able to look back and say to our children that when we saw so many things going wrong in our country, we weren\u2019t afraid to speak up.</span></p> <p><span>Still, I can\u2019t help but feel a tinge of sadness and ambivalence. When so many hundreds of thousands of people converged in one place with one common purpose, there ought to have been more to show for it in the end, not just the election of a new president. All the energy we brought to New York could have been\u2014should have been\u2014harnessed for some concrete service in the world.</span></p> <p><span>Instead, I feel conflicted\u2014glad to have protested but mindful that our means of speaking out no longer has a significant impact on the public dialogue. It\u2019s a worry that will likely linger long past November.</span></p> <p><span>Benjamin J.

{"title": "Real Solutions Left Behind | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Ever since President Bush\u2019s signature No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) passed Congress, debates have raged over its focus on standardized testing to make schools more accountable for the education they offer. Now that the federal government has released its \u201cwatch list\u201d of failing schools\u2014that is, schools that don\u2019t show sufficient progress on improving annual test scores\u2014it is even clearer that Bush\u2019s one-size-fits-all solution to America\u2019s educational crisis isn\u2019t measuring up.</span></p> <p><span>The federal watch list, released last week, lists more than a third of Massachusetts school districts as \u201cin need of improvement,\u201d which is not a great showing for the birthplace of American public education. If these districts don\u2019t shape up, their schools could face anything from state interference in their administrative policies to a state takeover. Massachusetts\u2019s performance was fairly standard. Iowa, California and Alabama\u2014states rarely mentioned in the same breath when it comes to education policy\u2014all fell in the same general territory as the Bay State.</span></p> <p><span>But a closer look at the numbers paints a different picture. Of the 133 failing school districts in Massachusetts, 126 met the federal government\u2019s standards overall. These districts were put on the federal watch list because one of 16 categories of students failed to make \u201cadequate yearly progress.\u201d Some of Massachusetts\u2019s best schools\u2014in terms of overall achievement\u2014were placed on the watch list when a small group of students did poorly on a test. This strange outcome results from an understandable desire to help groups that are often underserved by the public schools.</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately, No Child Left Behind doesn\u2019t help these students by chastising their school districts. Here\u2019s what happens under No Child Left Behind: Let\u2019s say a school is put on a watch list because students who receive free lunch\u2014the school\u2019s most disadvantaged students\u2014have not improved quickly enough. In two years, all students at that school can enroll elsewhere. Of course, the school\u2019s most disadvantaged students are least likely to deal with the logistical and administrative hassle of moving to another school. They are also least likely to have parents who are engaged enough in their education to pull them out of a familiar environment in search of a better education. So some affluent students leave for the big wealthy school one town over. Because school funding is usually paid out based on enrollment, the failing school loses the resources it would need to clean up its act but keeps the students who most need additional resources.</span></p> <p><span>Over the next three years, the school loses autonomy to the state and to private contractors. At every stage, the stigma associated with the loss of status and autonomy encourages those who can to leave the failing school, while those who don\u2019t have the resources or the parental support to switch schools are left in a privatized trap that likely does even worse on Bush\u2019s tests than it did in the first place. And to make matters worse, the president has underfunded his own initiative, assuring that the students who are left behind in the failing school don\u2019t even receive the programs that the law calls for.</span></p> <p><span>No Child Left Behind is riddled with problems, but its biggest flaw is that it distracts policymakers from solutions that work. Educators know which programs work, and they know that declaring a school \u201cfailing\u201d and then pulling the rug out from under it isn\u2019t going to improve public education. Federal education policy must focus less on finding out which schools failed to educate some small subgroup of students and more on giving teachers the resources they need to succeed.</span></p>"}

The day I arrived in St. Petersburg, a band of terrorists took over a middle school in Beslan, a small southern town. And by the time I left the country, 360 children, parents and teachers were dead, many of them shot in the back as they ran from the school\u2019s collapsing gymnasium.</span></p> <p><span>I spent my last day in Russia staring at state-run television. Intermittent rain did not deter thousands from pouring onto Red Square in an inspiring display of national unity and heartbreak. The feeling was eerily similar to that of Sept. 11, 2001, when I joined thousands on Tercentenary Theatre to contemplate the inhuman scale of the attack perpetrated on my own country three years ago.</span></p> <p><span>I had barely arrived in the United States when Russian President Vladimir V. Putin announced a sweeping series of reforms aimed at centralizing his grip on the country\u2019s ruling apparatus. The Russian people, like Americans after 9/11, will also have to cope with a dual tragedy\u2014a loss of life accompanied by a loss of liberty. By now, Americans should know all about the sort of measures Putin put on the table\u2014the kind that won\u2019t likely do much to help the war on terror, but will do a great job handing the government useful tools to crack down on ordinary citizens. In this case, think the PATRIOT Act on speed.</span></p> <p><span>Putin\u2019s most noted\u2014and the most anti-democratic\u2014proposal is to allow the president to appoint regional governors instead of letting citizens elect them. This would effectively end Russia\u2019s federal experiment and decrease the checks on the central government built into the current constitution. And with the national legislature satisfied to remain a pliant tool of the Kremlin, that means more unchecked control for the president. But just to make sure it stays that way, Putin wants every member of the Duma, the lower house of parliament, to be elected using party lists\u2014that is, in the ballot box voters choose a party instead of a particular candidate. This offers obvious advantages to the large, resource-laden pro-Putin parties with widespread name recognition and eliminates the possibility for charismatic outsiders to win a seat based on raw popular appeal. Making all Duma elections party-list elections will also help to keep liberal-minded politicians out of the Duma because a party must get at least 5 percent of the national vote to get any seats in parliament at all\u2014a hurdle the liberal parties that do exist will probably not clear.</span></p> <p><span>After Sept. 11, it was a common saying that America would never be the same. A free country rocked by terror had to find a new balance between liberty and security. A similarly dangerous logic is now at work in the Russian Federation, with a vital difference. It is not that Russia will never be the same. Indeed, the problem is that the former superpower is becoming yet another iteration on the same old Russian model. Russia\u2019s young experiment with democracy looks more doomed than ever in the hands of an increasingly power-hungry ex-KGB officer, another Russian strong-man. America\u2019s post-9/11 path has been ultimately less anti-democratic than Russia\u2019s trajectory after Beslan because liberty has been a value of our nation state as long as it has existed. Russian history is marked by a nearly continuous adherence to despots, and traditions die hard.</span></p> <p><span>In the meantime, there isn\u2019t much President Bush can do to dissuade Putin from veering Russia off the path to liberal democracy. Bush\u2019s post-9/11 record on civil liberties hardly gives him the credibility to criticize another nation\u2019s sacrifices in the name of security. Even if the president did have the moral authority to rally the world\u2019s democracies, it is not clear most Americans would care to see him do it. After Putin\u2019s most blatant power-grab yet, the threat of de-democratization in Eastern Europe will likely continue to seem remote to an American public used to thinking of Russia as a defeated, ailing society\u2014more of a joke than a potentially powerful state.</span></p> <p><span>With leader of the free world unable to challenge Putin and keep morally consistent, it looks like the West may have to sit by and watch Russia\u2019s already weak democratic institutions crumble even faster than they had before.</span></p> <p><span><i>Stephen W.

{"title": "9/11 prompts faux documentary | Arts | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>\u201cWhen September 11 happened, a lot of us lost something,\u201d director Christian Johnston says. \u201cWe wanted to get in there and do something.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Less than a year later, Johnston and a small cast and crew were on location in Afghanistan, making September Tapes, a film about another American, grief-stricken ex-soldier Don Larson (George Calil), whose response to the attacks is to get in and document \u201cthe truth behind September 11\u201d with a digital camera.</span></p> <p><span>Along the same lines, Johnston says he hopes the film will raise questions that many Americans have not asked about the way in which the search for Osama bin Laden was conducted. For example, why did many Afghans give little credit to President George W. Bush\u2019s offer of a $25 million reward? Did, as many Afghans believed, the United States allow the conflict to extend in order to secure plans for an oil pipeline?</span></p> <p><span>Most importantly, Johnston asks why the majority of Westerners, including U.N. officials and CNN analysts, were not aware of the list of al Qaeda\u2019s specific demands. This list was made public several years before the Sept. 11 attacks, without response from any Western power. Though never directly sympathetic to the terrorists, the filmmakers constantly offer a perspective that includes the political context that led to the attacks.</span></p> <p><span>The film is presented as a compendium of eight of Larson\u2019s tapes found by soldiers on the Pakistani border shortly after a battle with al Qaeda. The videos contain footage of Larson, his Afghan-American interpreter Wali Zarif (Wali Razaqi), and their cameraman Sonny (Sunil Sadarangani) on their way from Kabul to the Pakistani border in the search for bin Laden.</span></p> <p><span>Shot chronologically on location during the period the narrative covers, the piece treads a unique and sometimes treacherous line between reality and fiction. The main characters are invented, but most of the Afghans who appear are not actors, and many were unaware that the project was not a documentary.</span></p> <p><span>From the start, everyone understood that filming in Afghanistan would be a risky undertaking. Only a few months earlier, the murder of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl in Pakistan had shaken the world of journalism. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the filming commenced amid chaos: the day before their team landed in Afghanistan vice-president Haji Qadir was assassinated, and the crew\u2019s first twenty-four hours in Kabul were punctuated by multiple bomb threats.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think all of us had some reservations,\u201d Johnston says when asked about the danger.  \u201cWe had no official U.N., no U.S. support. We were told if anything happened not to call them.\u201d He hopes that the film reflects the fear and anxiety he felt as a Westerner in Afghanistan. \u201cIt was a humbling experience,\u201d he says, \u201crealizing that there was a bounty on our heads, that we were unprotected.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>From the beginning, however, the crew believed deeply in the film\u2019s importance. In the planning stages, when it became clear just how unwilling studios were to offer funding, each personally invested several thousands of dollars in order to make it happen. \u201cNot a small amount of money,\u201d Johnston says. \u201cIt was a big commitment to the project.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Even when the situation was at its scariest, the crew maintained the determination to record the chaos of post-war Afghanistan. Johnston says that his film gave some Afghans their first chance to voice their opinions of the situation. In spite of the risks involved in associating with Western journalists, the locals the crew met were eager to have a part in the project, and he believes they spoke honestly in the casual interviews captured on tape.</span></p> <p><span>Despite Johnston\u2019s ostensibly noble sense of purpose, a number of critics call September Tapes a craven attempt to cash in on the Sept. 11 tragedy, and several have suggested that the film should not have been made at all.</span></p> <p><span>Amid complaints about Blair Witch-style camerawork and flat, reality-show type dialogue, their principal criticism is of the highly ambiguous blend of reality and fiction, which leaves them wondering whether they should trust anything the film says. Only the credits (which list the names of actors who played each role) indicate that it is a work of fiction.</span></p> <p><span>Johnston, however, doesn\u2019t consider the blend problematic. He wanted the film to be accessible and appealing to Americans who are not normally attracted to documentaries. This includes his father, a Vietnam veteran who \u201cjust doesn\u2019t go see documentaries.\u201d Furthermore, he claims, \u201call documentaries are manipulated to some degree\u2026the truth was not just floating there for us to find.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The DVD version of the film will feature footage of the real crew\u2019s journey during production, which may help audiences distinguish which elements were scripted and which were real and help deflate criticism on that count.</span></p> <p><span>Also under heavy fire is the \u201cunsympathetic\u201d and \u201cunbelievable\u201d character of Don Larson, whose ill-advised actions frequently put his companions in danger. One reviewer complains that Lars acts \u201clike a combination of John Wayne and Sylvester Stallone,\u201d and declares that September Tapes is not a \u201cserious film.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Johnston, seemingly aware of the criticism, claims that Larson\u2019s personality was deliberately created to provoke. Johnston and Van Gregg were influenced by Joseph Conrad\u2019s Heart of Darkness, Michael Herr\u2019s Dispatches, and the pseudo-documentary recreation of the French war in Algeria, The Battle of Algiers, and they do not consider their protagonist a hero, even though some of his opinions and emotions coincide with theirs. Rather, Larson\u2019s preoccupation with the attacks on the U.S., his superficial knowledge of Afghanistan and his frequently cavalier attitude towards collateral damage are intended to reflect critically on American foreign policy all over the globe.</span></p> <p><span>When asked whether he feared that the public reaction to the film might stall over questions about the film\u2019s \u201creal\u201d and staged episodes, Johnston said that it \u201cmight, to a certain degree.\u201d  But even if viewers are skeptical, he says he will have achieved one of his goals.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cEven if we don\u2019t answer our question, at least we pose it,\u201d he says. \u201cI want people who see this to leave and question everything they see.\u201d Still, given the frustration and indignation that the film has sparked among critics, there looms the unfortunate possibility that this experiment\u2019s main themes are too understated to effectively convey Johnston\u2019s point.</span></p>"}
{"title": "New Music | Arts | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Green Day</span></p> <p><span>(Warner Brothers)</span></p> <p><span>Green Day\u2019s new album is supposed to be some kind of rock opera about America\u2019s post-9/11 terror paranoia, but really that\u2019s completely irrelevant so it will not be mentioned again. The focus should stay far more centered on the poor songwriting and bloated lyrics on this record, and with the exception of the first single, nothing here is any fun. Green Day seems to be getting tired.</span></p> <p><span>Billie Joe Armstrong\u2019s self important new obsession with \u201cpolitics\u201d exposes him for the guy he wishes he had been on the last two GD records\u2014an immature teenager trapped inside a thirty-something\u2019s body. The anti-establishment imagery painted all over the album and its \u201cbackstory\u201d aren\u2019t very well reflected in the songs. Although this could have been a good development, they strangely vie to replace it with boring, disingenuous stories of teen angst and disenchantment. BJ seems to realize that he can no longer pull this off in the first person, but the tricky mechanism he employs instead is about as ridiculous as 50 Cent making a concept record about being a gangster.</span></p> <p><span>I love Green Day, and you probably do too, but while the band\u2019s last couple of efforts (Warning and Nimrod) contained enough amazing songs to justify their continued existence, \u201cAmerican Idiot\u201d slams the nails into their coffin with a depressingly heavy hand.</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Leon Neyfakh</i></span></p> <p><span><b>Kiss and Tell</b></span></p> <p><span>Sahara Hotnights</span></p> <p><span><b>(RCA)</b></span></p> <p><span>Sahara Hotnights\u2019 story seems plucked from some major label\u2019s idea book: Four women, all younger than twenty-five, growing up together in the same Swedish neighborhood, eventually discovering the Buzzcocks and Ramones and deciding to take on today\u2019s hipster boys at their own game of 80\u2019s-inspired punk-pop. While the formula sounds more Spice Girls than Sleater-Kinney, the Hotnights still manage legitimacy. Since their teenage years the four have been making rock music on their own terms and have risen from European obscurity thanks to nonstop dedication and undeniable talent. They landed stateside in 2002 with their sophomore album, Jennie Bomb, sold to the American audience on their good looks and tight hooks, and they are now back with their third album, the peppy and enjoyable Kiss &amp; Tell.</span></p> <p><span>Kiss &amp; Tell kicks off with the barnstorming \u201cWho Do You Dance For,\u201d and immediately it is clear that the band is setting their charts on New Wave and power-pop glory, snarling with a mid-distortion guitar riff and Maria Andersson\u2019s sweet-but-tough vocals. Two minutes later, as the song fades out to overlapping cries \u201cEvery night, every night! Ev-er-y night!\u201d their influences are clear: These Swedes are doing their best Go-Go\u2019s, without looking back for a second.</span></p> <p><span>The album pounds away with track after track of similar glee, mixing the melodies but keeping the attitude, never resorting to a schlocky ballad or any other break from the frantic pace. Lyrics tell of boys that come and go, but their lyrics of love and loss, pain and joy rarely come to the forefront: A deliberate move, apparently, on an album that relies instead on spiky hooks and sugary harmonies, Casio keyboards and above all, never-flagging energy.</span></p> <p><span>Though every song shares this bouncy 80\u2019s girl-group aesthetic, several tracks stand out in the mix. The kinetic intro to \u201cNerves,\u201d the album\u2019s hardest track, betrays any claim that the album is short on flat-out rock, though the vocals still have moments breaking into heavenly high squeal, and it\u2019s a compromise deftly handled by the band. On \u201cStay / Stay Away\u201d Andersson\u2019s voice reaches levels of emotion seen nowhere else on the album. In a second she turns from desperately declaring \u201cit breaks my heart when you tell me to go\u201d to rocking out in frustration with her girls behind her: \u201cI\u2019d stand on every corner around you / I will always be right behind you.\u201d It\u2019s a rare moment on the album when the lyrical content\u2014not great, but let\u2019s be fair; it\u2019s not their first language\u2014mingles with the sound to mutual advantage. When the girls are singing together, it\u2019s reminiscent of the sense of fun that was integral to the ideology of early MTV\u2019s girly darlings, and we remember the verity of the Hotnights\u2019 formation: these are four life-long girlfriends, and their unity and cohesion can\u2019t be forgotten on any moment of the album.</span></p> <p><span>A first listen might reveal Sahara Hotnights as nothing but a B-league Sleater-Kinney, but after a few spins it\u2019s clear that this band makes no pretensions to the riot-grrl ideology usually accompanying any girl-group aspiring to produce punk-pop. In short, they are playing this music without any agenda but fun, and this veneer permeates every moment. This band doesn\u2019t need videos of themselves waterskiing in formation or cavorting playfully around a fountain to prove themselves as true to their declared image: the music of Kiss &amp; Tell speaks for itself</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Christopher A. Kukstis</i></span></p> <p><span><b>Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned</b></span></p> <p><span>The Prodigy</span></p> <p><span>(Maverick)</span></p> <p><span>What made the Prodigy\u2019s 1997 release The Fat of the Land so potent and noteworthy was that it found its genesis in the late-90s British rave scene while giving a hefty nod to something more hardcore. With the heavily-pierced and demonic-looking Keith Flint posing as front man, the Prodigy had legions singing along to the inane and repetitive lyrics of the likes of \u201cFirestarter,\u201d \u201cBreathe\u201d and even the controversial \u201cSmack My Bitch Up.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Their newest album Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned begins strongly, seeming to pick up where The Fat of the Land left off. \u201cSpitfire,\u201d the album\u2019s opening track, is a blood-pumping electronic anthem that plays like the aural equivalent of a shot of adrenaline to the heart. Much like Oasis\u2019s \u201cFucking in the Bushes,\u201d there\u2019s simply no sitting still while listening to this song. Sadly, however, the remaining twelve tracks come nowhere near to living up to this high standard. The second track \u201cGirls\u201d sounds like an unholy marriage of the all of the worst elements of old-school rap and British drum and bass rave music.</span></p> <p><span>This album\u2019s major fault stems from the absence of the crazed Keith Flint. What had made the Prodigy so unique was its ambiguous and unique identity as an electronica band with an identifiable voice and front man; it wasn\u2019t just rave music, but something new with a cool beat that you could sing along to. Evidently, however, the real brains behind the Prodigy from the start was arranger/producer Liam Howlett and, in this latest effort, he takes the band back to its roots, unfortunately relegating it to the category of mediocre dance music.</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Steven N. Jacobs</i></span></p> <p><span><b>Straight Outta Ca$hville</b></span></p> <p><span>Young Buck</span></p> <p><span>(G-Unit/Interscope)</span></p> <p><span>The title of Young Buck's first solo project, <i>Straight Outta Ca$hville</i>, is a throwback to 1989's <i>Straight Outta Compton</i>, the classic gang life manifesto from N.W.A. (Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, Easy-E, M.C. Ren and D.J. Yella). N.W.A.'s depictions of violence, often directed against the police, put Los Angeles on the hip hop map. Hailing from Nashville, Buck hopes to do for the Dirty South with <i>Ca$hville</i> what <i>Compton</i> did for the Wild West.</span></p> <p><span>Buck, formerly a Cash Money Millionaire who\u2014though still a millionaire\u2014currently rolls with G-Unit, clearly takes a great deal of pride in his Southern roots. Most of the songs on <i>Ca$hville</i> are situated in his old Tennessee hustling grounds. In \"Do It Like Me,\" Buck boasts: \"I know I got a dirty mouth, bitch, I'm from the South / I'm nothin' like what you done seen or you done heard about.\" But from the gunshots that open the album to the gritty tales of life in the 'hood to the vicious threats against rival rappers like Ja Rule, everything sounds very familiar. Buck embraces the same themes and uses the same thundering beats featured in the solo albums of his G-Unit counterparts 50 Cent (<i>Get Rich Or Die Tryin'</i>) and Lloyd Banks (<i>The Hunger for More</i>).</span></p> <p><span>There are a few fresh tracks on <i>Ca$hville</i> including \"Let Me In,\" a club hit with a catchy staccato melody, and \"Look At Me Now,\" in which a reflective Buck raps about \"what these streets done done to me\" over a bouncy beat by Denaun Porter (who produced the steel pan anthem \"P.I.M.P.\" for 50 Cent). Unlike <i>Compton</i>, however, <i>Ca$hville</i> fails to inspire any awe or fear of Southern street culture. It is Tennessee, after all.</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Andrew C.

Brillat adapted from her own novel, Pornocratie, which begins with a random gay man stopping a random woman from slashing her wrists in a club bathroom. In return, she offers to pay him to watch her in her most private moments: she hopes he can began to understand her by watching \u201cfrom the angle from which she should never be viewed.\u201d Perhaps unsurprisingly, this leads to some extreme behavior\u2014sexual and otherwise\u2014that tries to challenge assumptions by provoking.

You are at a frat party.\u201d With that beautifully written command, it is clear we have taken another trip to teen movie land.</span></p> <p><span>Some teen movies are so bad they are great\u2014epics of historical grandeur like She\u2019s All That or Bring It On deserve a place in any respectable time capsule\u2014First Daughter is not one of these. It\u2019s just bad.</span></p> <p><span>Katie Holmes stars as Samantha Mackenzie, the daughter of the president who yearns for a normal life, away from the prying eyes of the press and secret service. If this plot seems eerily like this past spring\u2019s Mandy Moore dud Chasing Liberty, it\u2019s because it is exactly the same. Literally.</span></p> <p><span>Like a month-old Krispy Kreme doughnut, the sweetness of this coming-of-age film is nauseating from the first bite: Sam and President Dad (Michael Keaton) are introduced via an encounter over a massive, middle-of-the-night slice of chocolate cake and waltzing rendezvous. The scene evokes your typical father/daughter interaction, especially those whose relationships have slightly Elektra-shaded overtones.</span></p> <p><span>Sam, who dresses like a still curly-haired Chelsea Clinton, leaves the next morning for a Berkeley-esque college, where she realizes quickly her dream of normalcy\u2014which entails, in her immortal words, \u201ccruising around in a Volkswagen Beetle with a cooler in the passenger seat holding a bologna sandwich and a beer\u201d\u2014 will be hard to achieve.</span></p> <p><span>Part of the difficulty are the two massive Secret Service bodyguards that her two bodyguards are always lurking around protecting Sam. Although one is almost constantly mute\u2014might he possibly end the movie saying something incredibly wise?\u2014codename \u201cCharm Bracelet\u201d resents the intrusive protection.</span></p> <p><span>Luckily, she meets and falls for her older hunky resident advisor, James (all-American boy-next-door Mark Blucas, whose future as a WB star is all but guaranteed), because he makes her feel, well, ordinary in that \u201cHey I\u2019m just another girl trying my best to sketchily hit on the nearest older male authority figure\u201d way.</span></p> <p><span>In this fairy-tale world, Sam gets a little wild as she celebrates her new freedom with James by eating cotton candy in an amusement park unchaperoned, sliding down a waterslide with her clothes on and spending a date in a rowboat, holding a pink parasol as he holds a small fishing rod. There is one particularly moving scene where Sam eats a slice of pizza and, as the grease slides down her throat, remarks that it \u201ctastes like freedom\u201d\u2014at which point I teared up, remembering my own first taste of delicious grease freedom.</span></p> <p><span>In truth there are some phenomenal moments in the spirit of the great teen movies of yore\u2014a wasted Sam table dancing at a pimps and hos party while dressed as Pamela Anderson, a bizarrely homoerotic fraternity striptease involving the American flag, and some unwholesome shots of Katie Holmes\u2019s famed cleavage\u2014but sadly these scenes are too infrequent and not nearly ridiculous enough to carry the audience through Sam\u2019s tedious series of trials and tribulations.</span></p> <p><span>Yes, people take her picture, the boy she likes hasn\u2019t kissed her yet and her ethnically ambiguous slut of a roommate (who accentlessly claims to hail from Alabama) draws on her family portrait. In the words of Vanessa Kerry: \u201cThere are pictures of my breasts all over the internet!\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Ultimately, First Daughter takes itself too seriously, is not compelling enough to be serious and most tragically does not have one choreographed dance number to redeem it. Watching Holmes in this utterly shallow role, I feel secondhand embarrassment reminiscent of Jenna and Babs\u2019 stand-up at the Republican National Convention. (EMK)</span></p> <p><span>The Forgotten</span></p> <p><span>What if a normal and recognizable woman suddenly went to war with her world, trapped by memories that conflicted with what the people she trusted would have her believe, fighting for the truth as she felt it in her core, struggling to prove that her son was more than just a figment of post-miscarriage depression? This, the trailer for The Forgotten, splashed across the screen to intrigue and thrill me as I waited to be entertained by the indie music and muted palette of Garden State last month. That scene where the protagonist storms into Ash\u2019s study and pulls off the wallpaper, revealing the drawings of his disappeared daughter, may be one of the most brilliantly constructed seat-fillers I\u2019ve ever witnessed, and most of the friends I\u2019ve asked would agree.</span></p> <p><span>Beyond its potential for fun, it had the makings of an intelligent paranoid thriller. It could reflect our times and connect with the uncertainty so many of us feel about what\u2019s really going on in our world. The key was Julianne Moore\u2019s desperate call for empathy, for believers: I wanted to believe. On this evidence alone, I was willing. But, as is too often the case in this era, it was a sleazy bait and switch scheme\u2014I found nothing spectacular or terrifying in The Forgotten, only government agents scrambling to hide a conspiracy and scrambled plot lines trying to hide a lack of creativity. My faith was clearly unfounded.</span></p> <p><span>It seemed the film would be about the intricacies of the human mind, the ways in which memory can edit itself to protect us, how it can warp our perception of our lives to the extent that what is true for one person is considered delusional by those around her. The Forgotten teased me with echoes of Memento and The Sixth Sense and stirrings of Conspiracy Theory, with all the necessary ingredients for a philosophically sound, psychologically wrenching treatment of the division between reality and our experience of it. Still, although it begins on the right path, it quickly took the one most traveled by: it devolved into the kind of typical thriller I never would have wasted an hour and a half of my own life watching.</span></p> <p><span>Such a failure occurred despite the guarantee a seemingly competent cast should offer. Although Moore can be shrill and fragile in some films, her Telly Paretta is a likeable everywoman. Gary Sinise, as Telly\u2019s therapist, is appropriately authoritarian, with a dose of compassion and an otherworldly magnetism, while her husband, ER\u2019s Anthony Edwards, with the benefit of limited screen time, appears to be phoning in his support from another planet. Dominic West plays Ash Correll, the father of another \u201cforgotten\u201d child and Telly\u2019s partner in revealing conspiracy, with self-confidence in his bearing and sufficient limits on his emotional pull.</span></p> <p><span>The acting may be only good and not outstanding, but the film is flawed not because of the actors but due to the product they\u2019ve been asked to deliver. To take just one example, Ash is not only Lauren\u2019s father and Telly\u2019s companion but also, serendipitously, a former New York Ranger, complete with the physical prowess and lightning reflexes necessary to foil the plots of men in black and extraterrestrial beings alike.</span></p> <p><span>The best aspects of the film are all there in that wickedly misleading trailer: the disconnect between Telly\u2019s memory and that of those around her and the viscerality of our shock as she reveals the history beneath the fa\u00e7ade in Correll\u2019s daughter\u2019s room, demonstrating the Oz-like nature of the world they inhabit. As it progresses, however, these ideas and feelings recede into the background, pushed out by car chases, government conspiracies, and, of all things, aliens.</span></p> <p><span>Certainly, I got some shudders and had to jump in my seat a few times, but I hadn\u2019t come for that\u2014and even for a thriller it didn\u2019t make much sense, by film\u2019s end. The Forgotten turned out to be the kind of film from which you can expect to walk away at least with a vision of the darker side, of the stuff of nightmares and dystopian visions, a new cinematic trick in your bag of coping mechanisms for what life throws at you.</span></p> <p><span>The end here, though, is sunny\u2014a grave stylistic misstep. In a climate of uncertainty, where parents are never sure their children will survive to come home, a film that builds up their brightest hopes is merely pandering. At the end, we see the crazy lady isn\u2019t actually crazy: It\u2019s her world that is insane. The validation of her fears should have been enough of a conclusion, and in our world it would have been, but, for The Forgotten, it was not. (ABM)</span></p> <p><span>Head In The Clouds</span></p> <p><span>Within the first ten minutes of Head in the Clouds, you realize the significance of the title. It\u2019s about idealism at both ends of the spectrum: the idealism of political activism and the idealism of political apathy. From there, the movie goes on hammering you with that idea of idealism for as long as you\u2019re willing to stay put in front of the screen.</span></p> <p><span>Charlize Theron, in a starkly contrasting follow-up to her role in Monster, embodies this second kind of idealism as Gilda Bess\u00e9.  Gilda is the kind of clich\u00e9d wise-cracking beauty that can only exist in movies: she\u2019s bold, intelligent, entirely immodest and incredibly provocative. Her only fault, as far as her love interest Guy (Stuart Townsend) can see, is that she lives \u201cin a cocoon\u201d and completely ignores the caustic contemporary politics that consume his passions; she doesn\u2019t care about anything or anyone beyond herself and those immediately close to her. This often translates into meaningless amorous relationships of convenience that further her various careers or otherwise allow her to continue to live in the manner to which she is accustomed. Normally, this would look like superficiality, but with her it\u2019s merely incorruptibility. She\u2019s a girl who just wants to have fun.</span></p> <p><span>Leading a life of careless fun, however, can be difficult when you live in Paris during the 1930s. To the south, the Spanish Civil War is raging with the fascist Nationalists slowly crushing the Republican freedom fighters, and just ahead lies the impending Nazi invasion of France. Although she is eager to ignore these things, Guy and her Spanish roommate Mia (Penelope Cruz) won\u2019t allow her to, by constantly moping and debating over the most recent news reports and, ultimately, by leaving her to join the Republican Army in Spain. Guy and, to a lesser degree, Mia obviously (far too obviously) represent the deluded idealism of the enraged youth just itching to make a difference.</span></p> <p><span>In the end, everyone in this movie has their head in the clouds in one way or another: the characters, the director, and the viewer, because there\u2019s no way that this movie is going to work. While the film has its merits, it falls flat on most fronts.  In addition to having fairly poor production value\u2014the bulk of the \u201cstunning\u201d Parisian backdrops are clearly matte paintings\u2014the movie\u2019s three primary characters never achieve humanity; they start out as and remain types.  Gilda is the extroverted and rambunctious bohemian socialite, Guy is the wide-eyed British schoolboy with a conscience, and Mia is the long-suffering martyr who has made it through the school of hard knocks and is turning around to take another long lap. Even real-life lovebirds Theron and Townsend fail to make their on-screen relationship believable. It\u2019s impossible to either identify or sympathize with their tumultuous affair.</span></p> <p><span>Head in the Clouds makes a feeble and heavy-handed stab at depth and profundity, and, to its credit, it nuances the subject matter enough to show that things weren\u2019t quite so clear-cut as all Nazis are evil and Allies are good, but it just gets in way over its head. Maybe that would have made a better title. (SNJ)</span></p> <p><span>September Tapes</span></p> <p><span>As Iraq dominates headlines and political conversation, director Christian Johnston would have us remember America\u2019s other war\u2014the increasingly peripheral conflict in Afghanistan. Johnston\u2019s assessment of the original War on Terror largely echoes Sen. John Kerry\u2019s recent charge that official assertions of stability and freedom in Iraq constitute a \u201cfantasy world of spin.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Filmed entirely in Afghanistan, \u201cSeptember Tapes\u201d investigates American progress in that nation and offers compelling evidence that claims of success there have been thoroughly fictionalized. Inexplicably, however, Johnston chose to fictionalize his expos\u00e9, creating an elaborate ruse in order to criticize what he seems to view as a far more elaborate\u2014and more pernicious\u2014ruse. The result is a bizarre and unconvincing distortion of otherwise mesmerizing original footage.</span></p> <p><span>The film purports to be a series of eight tapes obtained from Northern Alliance forces after \u201cthe last known battle involving the leaders of al-Qaeda and Osama Bin Laden.\u201d It remains unclear whether the Northern Alliance is responsible for the slick slow-motion editing.</span></p> <p><span>The tapes chronicle the efforts of American documentary filmmaker Don Larson, dazed and embittered by his grief over losses in the Sept. 11 attacks, to understand, record and possibly join the hunt for Osama bin Laden. He is accompanied by his translator, Wali Zarif, and a curiously laconic cameraman who is either a failed attempt at comic relief or simply an emblem of the film\u2019s utter weirdness.</span></p> <p><span>Larson (who goes by \u201cLars\u201d) and Zarif are invented characters, played by actor George Calil and actor/producer Wali Razaqi, respectively. They are part of Johnston\u2019s actual five-man crew, which skillfully uses the roleplay to gain access to warlords, bounty hunters, and Northern Alliance members who believe they are being interviewed for a genuine documentary.</span></p> <p><span>If only they were. The impassioned disputes that erupt at the mere mention of Osama bin Laden, the disturbingly jaded views of American motivations held by our supposed allies among the Afghans and the palpable danger of an arms dealer\u2019s shed after dark are all powerfully unsettling. The inability to determine the loyalties of men standing on barren hillsides with rifles is eerily evocative of the American predicament in Vietnam. Watching the crew careen through Kabul amid real machine gun fire at least equals, and perhaps eclipses, the thrill of elaborately staged action.</span></p> <p><span>But the film\u2019s fictional portions are as poor as these moments are brilliant. The script and acting conspire to deny the Larsen character any credibility. His voiceover commentary is both gratingly juvenile\u2014\u201ca real bounty hunter\u201d\u2014and absurdly hard-boiled\u2014\u201cwhat might just be our VIP pass into the shitstorm?\u201d. He has the mentality and combat skills of a commando, but the profession and body art of a hipster. Larson\u2019s real physical courage is entirely at odds with his recurring self-conscious pose, pensively staring out from a Jeep while exaggeratedly drawing on a cigarette.</span></p> <p><span>Although Razaqi, who essentially plays himself as a capable guide and translator named Wali returning to Afghanistan from America, is somewhat better, he finds himself at the center of a series of contrived scenarios. The fictional Wali\u2019s sudden declaration that the 9/11 attacks are attributable to American foreign policy choices is a perfunctory nod to political debate. Later, his decision to voice his skittishness in a meeting with hostile arms dealers is implausibly foolish.</span></p> <p><span>Most distressingly, the foibles in the fiction of September Tapes prompt a host of all too easily answered questions that distract from the substantive reflection that the film would otherwise promote. The viewer asks himself: Why does Lars have a trace of a British accent? Because Calil is English. Why do Lars and Wali, formally introduced at the start of the film, immediately act as if they have known each other for some time? Because Calil and Razaqi have. Would Lars be better off without his iPod during machine gun skirmishes with the Taliban? Yes, despite the iPod\u2019s role in the film\u2019s off-color quasi-twist ending.</span></p> <p><span>The scripted story\u2019s sheer ridiculousness forces these and other oddities to the forefront. Time would be better spent contemplating the American role in the disarray that Johnston so effectively captures in the non-fiction filming at the movie\u2019s core.</span></p> <p><span>Johnston aims to debunk the myths of the Afghani situation\u2014Lars asks accusatorily, \u201cWhere\u2019s the US military? Where\u2019s CNN?\u201d\u2014and seems to want to extract the truth of U.S. foreign policy from its many layers of spin. So he should probably know better: Fictionalization obscures meaning, marginalizing from the public consciousness what deserves a place at the forefront. The stateside studio is the place for genre experimentation; original footage of a war zone\u2019s unseen chaos speaks for itself.

{"title": "What's Left (or Right) To Trust? | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>More than four years ago, in February of 2000, my local CBS affiliate in Chicago tried something different. With the mantra \u201cno water-skiing squirrels\u201d and the expertise of veteran Chi-town anchor Carol Marin, \u201cThe 10 p.m. News with Carol Marin\u201d attempted to take local news back in time. Gone were the menacing, sensational teasers as the station went to commercial\u2014\u201cWhat your family should know about strangulation this Christmas season\u201d\u2014replaced by Marin standing and reciting the day\u2019s news as impassively as a mannequin.</span></p> <p><span>It was a throwback to the 1950s. And fifty years behind its time, the newscast failed. By August, there were rumblings that the CBS affiliate would can the format. By November, Carol Marin and her hardcore local news posse were toast. Their attempt at de-sensationalizing local news had only revealed the extent to which Americans (or at least Chicagoans) had become accustomed to the current sorry, sensationalized state of news in America.</span></p> <p><span>Flash forward to 2004. Three 24-hour cable news channels compete for viewers. CNN captures the liberals, Fox News the conservatives and MSNBC the viewers who are transfixed by long acronyms. Fox News is winning the cable battle, and during the Republican National Convention it even beat the networks. At the same time, media intellectuals, pundits and ordinary Americans alike agree that Fox exhibits a fairly extreme bias towards the right. Eighty-nine percent of Americans trust museums for unbiased information. Thirty-six percent trust television news. These numbers don\u2019t really add up. Americans in the twenty-first century seem to have developed a contradictory stance towards the media. On one hand, they demand their news to be exciting. On the other, they clearly wouldn\u2019t mind if their news were more trustworthy. Problem is, trustworthiness and sensationalism don\u2019t mix too well.</span></p> <p><span>The lack of trust Americans have in their media is reflected by the number of media watchdog groups, each with its own left- or right-leaning agenda, that have sprung up in the last few years. There\u2019s the Media Research Center, whose mission is to \u201cprove that liberal bias in the media does exist and undermines traditional American values.\u201d And then there\u2019s Media Matters for America, whose opposing raison d\u2019etre is \u201cto comprehensively monitor, analyze, and correct conservative misinformation in the U.S. media.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>There\u2019s no denying that individual media outlets cover events differently. Just look at the headlines. When interim Prime Minister of Iraq Ayad Allawi addressed a joint session of Congress recently, reporters from both Fox News and CNN attended the same speech\u2014but they didn\u2019t write the same stories. The headline on CNN.com read, \u201cBush: US Won\u2019t Abandon Iraqi People.\u201d Fox News chose the simpler: \u201cAllawi: Thank You America.\u201d Judging only from the headlines, Fox\u2019s pro-Iraq war, conservative stance comes through loud and clear. The articles also highlight different aspects of the speech, with Fox focusing on Allawi\u2019s gratefulness to America where CNN notes that the speech was made against a backdrop of growing violence and hostage-taking. There is little overlap throughout the stories. Each outlet mentions different facts, emphasizes different points and even presents the story differently (Fox News put the story at the top of its website with a picture; CNN opted for a simple hyperlinked headline). These are two different accounts of the same event. So who\u2019s telling the truth?</span></p> <p><span>To answer this, we need to understand why media outlets form their own, unique biases. Research has shown that people tend to watch news from media outlets which share their own opinions. That means it\u2019s in the interest of media companies to stray from absolute neutrality. Slant the news a little, and you\u2019ve instantly differentiated your newspaper or TV station from the competition. Add headlines more sensationalized and jingoistic than your competitors, and you\u2019ve instantly beaten them. Wooden information-deliverers like Carol Marin don\u2019t stand a chance against the boisterous Bill O\u2019Reilly and the seductive Paula Zahn. The media are a business, and their business is presenting biased information in a way that catches the eye of their target viewers.</span></p> <p><span>It\u2019s important to keep bias and sensationalism separate. Media bias is as old as the printing press, and it\u2019s not going away. Sensationalism, however, has only as much staying power as we media consumers give it. Recently, we\u2019ve been a bit too generous. When media outlets differentiate themselves by bending the truth and overstating the facts, it\u2019s tough to know what\u2019s left to trust. It\u2019s also tough to blame them for their excesses. The consumer confidence problem plaguing American media\u2014the problem that has convinced 64 percent of America that the media are untrustworthy (up from 46 percent in mid-1989)\u2014is not the media\u2019s fault. It\u2019s ours.</span></p> <p><span>We\u2019re demanding unreasonable things from the men and women who write our news. We want the CBS ten o\u2019clock news to be as exciting as the 9 o\u2019clock drama. And we also want each bit of news analyzed accurately and neutrally. We want to think that the biased, sensationalized headlines flashing in front of us actually reflect the truth, even as our own demands on media make the truth harder and harder to present in a way that interests us. Until Americans stop insisting that the media cater to contradictory goals, water-skiing squirrels will carve circles around intelligent news.</span></p> <p><span><i>Alex Slack \u201906 is a history concentrator in Leverett House.

{"title": "An Obligation to the Future | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>When the College was last in session, news reports provided a near-constant reminder of the war being fought on the other side of the world. Three months later, the coverage of the war may have lessened, but the costs have surely not. Despite the early perception of a swift victory last spring, little has actually improved on the ground in Iraq. For the American soldiers in the thick of it, this summer has been anything but a vacation.</span></p> <p><span>This summer saw two major milestones, though both were largely symbolic. On June 28, the U.S.-led coalition transferred limited sovereignty to a government of Iraqis, ending the reign of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) and placing control of the country\u2014at least officially\u2014in the hands of interim Prime Minister Ayad Allawi. Unfortunately, the transfer of power has not made the rocky road to peace in Iraq any smoother. Earlier this month, a second, far grimmer milestone: the number of U.S. casualties in Iraq crept past the sobering 1,000 mark.</span></p> <p><span>Sadly, a safe and peaceful Iraq seems an ever more distant dream. The Bush administration has been roundly criticized for its failures to plan adequately for reconstruction, and, in part due to those mistakes, stabilizing and rebuilding Iraq has proven to be a slow and exceedingly difficult process. A budding insurgency has led to a fracturing of the coalition\u2019s control of the region, and American credibility, which was already suffering, has taken further hits. As feared, Iraq has become a rallying point for terrorist recruitment throughout the Middle East. It was recently revealed that a classified C.I.A. report is predicting that Iraq may be on the verge of descending into civil war. Perhaps partially due to those fears, the U.S. announced aggressive new plans to take back rebel-held areas such as Falluja in advance of the country\u2019s election, which is scheduled for January. Those operations will likely be bloody, which may further jeopardize America\u2019s position in the broader war on terror.</span></p> <p><span>It is for all of these very valid reasons that the number of whispers supporting America quickly bowing out has been rising. Conservative columnist Robert Novak reported on Monday that inside officials suggest a second Bush White House may begin with a complete and sudden withdrawal of all troops from Iraq. Meanwhile, John Kerry vowed recently that if elected, he would set his sights on an Iraq exit within his first year in office. There has been a marked shift in the dialogue about the war; whereas neocons once dangled the possibility of democracy transforming the region, today even the most optimistic officials admit that a messy, fragmented and unstable Iraq is probably the best America can hope for.</span></p> <p><span>While we recognize these dire circumstances, we reject calls for prematurely leaving Iraq. Although we were not in favor of the war at its outset, much of our opposition was rooted in the fear that invading and destabilizing Iraq would ultimately make America less secure. We had severe misgivings about this administration\u2014so influenced by extreme ideologues\u2014and we doubted its resolve to invest properly in the foundations of a new nation.</span></p> <p><span>Seeing through this project of peace has never been more morally imperative. Departing Iraq immediately\u2014all the while knowing that chaos will ensue\u2014would be ethically irresponsible. While we may not have favored invasion in the first place, America made a promise to the people of Iraq\u2014and America must make a good faith effort to fulfill that promise. After all, this war has taken a profoundly larger toll on innocent Iraqi civilians\u2014unofficial estimates range from at least 10,000 to 37,000\u2014and all of them, in addition to the thousand Americans, deserve to have died in a worthwhile struggle. While removing Saddam Hussein was an undeniable victory, a violent civil war hardly leaves Iraq better off.</span></p> <p><span>In the long run, bowing out prematurely would only compound America\u2019s troubles in the war on terror. Strategically, it would cause irreparable harm to U.S. credibility. In addition, the environment likely to result from a failed Iraqi state is precisely the kind in which terrorist groups would thrive. What is needed, though, is not a continuation of the failed strategy of Secretary Rumsfeld\u2019s Pentagon. Instead, we must continue to look for new methods to minimize casualties and damage. Rule of law must be emphasized above all to distinguish the new government from regimes of the past. Furthermore, plans to train Iraqi soldiers must be ramped up and expedited; currently, despite promises, progress in this area has been tremendously slow. The sooner this war becomes a war within Islam\u2014between the reformists and the fundamentalists\u2014rather than a war between Islam and the West, the sooner dreams of democracy in the Middle East may be realized.</span></p> <p><span>With U.S. elections just around the corner, President Bush and Sen. Kerry must continue to elaborate on their plans for success in Iraq. They have only recently begun to talk substantively about the differences between their approaches, and there is still considerable room for more depth. For too long, both have relied repeatedly on empty assurances that they will \u201cdo a better job\u201d than their opponent. Such platitudes do not serve the electorate. The cost of being in Iraq is significant\u2014both in lives and money\u2014and those costs will remain a burden for the foreseeable future. Voters deserve to know what their candidates plan to do about it, and the Iraqi people deserve assurances that America honestly intends to fulfill its promise.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Not Just Another Placebo | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Three years ago, I came to America. Things were starting to fall apart in the Palestinian territories, and the peace that was born at Oslo a few years earlier was dying. It was the beginning of the end for the once hoped-for peace between Arabs and Jews. For me, it was the beginning of a new journey in life: a search for an opportunity in distant lands not torn by hate and injustice.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAmrika,\u201d as my parents and friends suggested, \u201cis the future.\u201d When people from my home thought of America, they thought of the utopia man has been searching for since the birth of time. I heard people say that problems always get solved in America, and life never stops because of an accident or a death in the family. The rumor was that America was perfect, but it was, how should I put this... a little exclusive. It was time for me to discover this wonderland everyone was talking about. It was a new world I was entering. And for a while I thought it was actually going to be perfect.</span></p> <p><span>It only took nineteen young Arabs on a cold September morning to bring the entire Middle-East nightmare back down on my head.</span></p> <p><span>For the world, September 11th was a disaster and a calamity; for me, it was more than that. It was the beginning of a fight I was all too familiar with: the kind in which there is no absolute victory or absolute defeat, only vengeance and sorrow.</span></p> <p><span>Ever since that dark day, life in America began to look more and more like life back home. Everyone had to be on alert, careful, and uncertain. There were flags in yards, on windows, cars, and pickup trucks. People were always talking about how the government was going to respond to the attack and at the same time getting ready for the next attack\u2014and similarly speculating about the response to that attack, and so on. There was hardly any talk about a real cure for the problem of terrorism. America, it seemed to me, was failing to act American. This place is no different, I thought to myself. This is going to be just like back home.</span></p> <p><span>Last week, I heard honest words from a not-so-often-honest man. The President of the United States of America declared that the war on terrorism cannot be won. In an interview with NBC news, President Bush said: \u201cI don\u2019t think you can win the war on terror.\u201d I always suspected that the war on terrorism could not be won, and certainly not with the kind of bankrupt strategy being followed today. A strategy entirely dedicated to creating obstacles to stop terrorists, rather than a strategy that also aims at putting an end to the roots of terrorism, is deeply flawed.</span></p> <p><span>Sooner or later terrorist minds will find a way to infiltrate our security measures, just as they have done in Madrid, Beslan, Saudi Arabia, and many other places. The terrorist that is killed or captured is almost instantaneously replaced by tens of young men and women eager to continue the job, proving that the spirit of terror lives on after terrorists die.</span></p> <p><span>What the people of the United States need today is honest reflection on the problem of terror. In times of war, the greatest difficulty comes in trying to stop and take a good look at the enemy\u2014to understand where the enemy is coming from.</span></p> <p><span>There is almost a universal consensus that evil minds are not born, but rather made. There are factors and conditions that make the creation of such evil easier and more probable. Poverty, injustice, and ignorance are factors which help develop the terrorist mentality and the mentality which sympathizes with contemporary terrorism.</span></p> <p><span>There are those who think of terrorist acts as acts of ultimate heroism and nobility. Indeed, these people are all over the world. They are in Saudi Arabia, Syria, Palestine, and they are in Indonesia and Pakistan, and they are in Chechnya, and they are in Afghanistan, and they are in Africa, and they are in Latin America. They are in every place where children are taught how to be proud, yet when they grow up all they feel is humiliation as their nations stumble from one failure to another; and they are in every place where a father or mother struggles and sweats all day to afford the price of a meal for a hungry family at night. They are in every place where boys keep hearing the phrase \u201cAmerica is the future.\u201d They are the forgotten passengers of the globalization journey stuck in a third class seat, begging for a taste of success. And to these people, terrorists are selling a fake victory\u2014a moment of balance when the strong feels vulnerable and violated by the weak.</span></p> <p><span>There will be people who say that this is yet another attempt to justify terrorism or condone it. Using the same chain of logic, then, those who point out that cigarette smokers are more vulnerable to cancer are cancer apologists. Nor is this a call to abrogate the use of force in the fight against terrorism. Force is needed, but we also need to understand and grasp factors that make the idea of terror take hold of man\u2019s imagination. And those who try to block such an attempt to understand this terror mentality are apostates disguised as patriots.</span></p> <p><span>In these uncertain times, we are facing an enemy like no other: an idea unleashed in the reality of wounded peoples. We are facing an enemy who has managed to include suicide in his definition of victory, managed to infiltrate the hearts of hundreds of thousands of young men across the globe and hence managed to surpass our capacity to contain him.</span></p> <p><span>As we approach a possible change in the White House, I hope the American people will choose to embrace a new policy in this war against terror. A real cure, not just another placebo. A policy not blinded by desire for vengeance, so that the light of hope can come into view. Let\u2019s help to improve poor nations, intensify humanitarian aid where needed, and promote peace and coexistence between adversary nations. A true remedy for terror will make it clear that there is no greater evil than a man capable of providing help who turns his back on another man in need. Only then will people abandon prejudice and celebrate life, not death. Only then, can we truly win on terror.</span></p> <p><span><i>Mohammed J.

From balloons that fell at the right time to a round stage that drove a news cycle, the organizers of the RNC spoke to mainstream America with expertise that was envied by their Democratic counterparts, crafting every detail of the massive production to effectively communicate the desired message to average Americans. Ask these average Americans what comes to mind when they hear the words \u201cflip-flop\u201d and the answer is likely to be John Kerry. While it\u2019s easy to dismiss such an epitaph as a baseless partisan attack, doing so runs the risk of overlooking the disturbing degree to which it is justified.</span></p> <p><span>Accused of flip-flopping on the war in Iraq, Kerry defends his force-authorizing vote by claiming that he voted to threaten force rather than to actually use it. But the fact is that in an interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News on May 4, 2003, after Saddam Hussein had been disarmed, Kerry clearly said, \u201cI think it was the right decision to disarm Saddam Hussein, and when the President made the decision, I supported him, and I support that fact that we did disarm him.\u201d In direct contradiction to his most recent claims, Kerry unequivocally stated that he supported the President\u2019s decision to use force, not just to threaten force.</span></p> <p><span>After voting to pass the Patriot Act and even defending it on the campaign trail, saying that it \u201c[had] to do with things that really were quite necessary in the wake of what happened on September 11,\u201d Kerry reversed his position and now decries it as a direct assault on fundamental American rights.</span></p> <p><span>After ridiculing President Bush for \u201cconfusing\u201d the war in Iraq with the war on terror, Kerry honored soldiers who died in Iraq by saying that they gave \u201ctheir lives on behalf of their country, on behalf of freedom in the war on terror.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Kerry voted in favor of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993, saying that the bill \u201crecognizes the reality of today\u2019s economy\u2014globalization and technology,\u201d but now says that he would vote against it.</span></p> <p><span>Kerry called Israel\u2019s security fence a \u201clegitimate act of self-defense\u201d after condemning it to the Arab American Institute National Leadership Conference as a \u201cbarrier to peace\u201d that serves \u201conly [to] harm Israel\u2019s security\u2026[and] increase hardships to [sic] the Palestinian people.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cCan\u2019t a guy change his mind?\u201d some ask. Of course, but these are just a few of the issues on which the Democratic presidential nominee blatantly reversed his position as soon as doing so became politically expedient. The distance between his positions on a given issue, and the frequency of his drastic alterations, should be serious causes for concern among two different groups for two different reasons. Kerry supporters should be worried about the election. When a race is close and comes down to undecideds and voter turnout among the base, a candidate with Kerry\u2019s scattered record should beware. When undecideds consider the candidates a toss-up on the issues, they often decide based on who they like, trust and know. Kerry has trouble in all three areas. He will also have trouble motivating his base\u2014disliking \u201cthe other guy\u201d only goes so far.</span></p> <p><span>But it\u2019s not just Kerry supporters who should be concerned. All Americans should be deeply troubled by a politician who takes one position when the war is popular and another when it loses favor, one with an Arab group and another when reaching out to Jews, one when the country unites after attack and another when running for the highest office in the land. The person we elect to be our president for the next four years must be someone we can trust to do what he believes is right. The dangers we face are serious and require a consistent, principled approach. When dealing with issues of life and death, taking a step in one direction before scampering in the other as soon as the polls change seriously compromises American security.</span></p> <p><span>Like many Democrats, when I hear the words \u201cflip-flop,\u201d I cringe. I cringe because flip-flops are unimportant and easily dismissed. I cringe because many hear \u201cflip-flop\u201d and are irritated by \u201cRepublican spin\u201d rather than troubled by unprincipled ambition. Flip-flops are trivial, but our decision this November is not.

In the statement above, the bargain is clearly worth it. Kerry is a \u201cflip-flop,\u201d just as his accuser is another type of shoe? Double entendre, phallic imagery, anti-war allusions? Incredible!</span></p> <p><span>To avoid any potential confusion, I will make explicit what my intentions are not: to mock George Bush\u2019s capacity for verbalizing coherent thoughts. I promise I have grown out of that. Yes, there was a time when I considered myself supremely cool for owning the book <i>Is Our Children Learning?</i>, when \u201csubliminable\u201d and \u201cwings take dream\u201d made for a satisfactory criticism of our alleged president. Not anymore. These days, I will be the first to defend George Bush\u2019s command of rhetoric and verbal manipulation. His words are, after all, a large part of why he currently appears to hold the lead in the presidential race. I don\u2019t mock that sort of thing.</span></p> <p><span>Take, for instance, the art of implied association. This has become one of Bush\u2019s tried-and-true recipes: one part Iraq, one part terrorism, mix and stir in the same sentence. It really is a brilliant strategy; he preys on the fear, compassion and patriotism evoked by terrorism in order to rally support for a war that has nothing to do with terrorism. In his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, Bush showed off this manipulative prowess: \u201cIn Saddam Hussein, we saw a threat... And I faced the kind of decision...no president would ask for, but must be prepared to make:\u00a0Do I forget the lessons of September 11 and take the word of a madman, or do I take action to defend our country?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>His selective amnesia might explain why in this sea of wartime chaos and controversy, Osama bin Laden has been conveniently lost. Not that Bush ever found him, of course, but now the Saudi fellow has vanished not only in reality, but also in rhetoric. I bet he is hiding away in some cave right now, feeling quite indignant. After all, he\u2019s the one who did the work, and Saddam got the credit. That\u2019s like plagiarism, only maybe a lot worse.</span></p> <p><span>And besides, Bush has already got his plate too full with Kerry to be worrying about leftovers like bin Laden. I\u2019ve got to hand it to Bush: \u201cFuzzy math\u201d was pretty clever, but \u201cflip-flop\u201d just might be a new personal best.</span></p> <p><span>One of Bush\u2019s favorite \u201cflip-flop\u201d stories involves the $87 billion of supplemental funds that Congress proposed for operations in Iraq, which Kerry says he initially supported but then later opposed: \u201cI actually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it.\u201d Bush clearly cannot forgive his opponent for this oratorical inferiority. By \u201cflip-flop,\u201d I think he is trying to say that at first, when a fair and economically feasible version of the bill was on the Senate floor, Kerry supported it, but after the Bush administration used the threat of a veto to change critical clauses of the bill, he decided to vote against it. Yeah, I guess if you put it that way, Kerry does sound pretty outrageous.</span></p> <p><span>But, if Bush is the rising star of verbal deceit, then Dick Cheney is already a formidable maestro of manipulation. He has recently made it clear that putting anyone but Bush in the Oval Office is an open invitation for terrorism: \u201cIf we make the wrong choice then the danger is that we\u2019ll get hit again and we\u2019ll be hit in a way that will be devastating from the standpoint of the United States,\u201d said Cheney. The implication, of course, is not only that Kerry is a national safety hazard, but also that the presence of Bush\u2019s regime somehow deters terrorism. The way Cheney tells it, I\u2019m almost ready to write off September 11 as just a minor gloss in an otherwise pristine record.</span></p> <p><span>Taken together, Bush\u2019s amiable prevarications and Cheney\u2019s clever malice just might spell a winning ticket. In a sense, they\u2019ve already won a personal victory: they have transformed their public image from that of tongue-tied oratorical brutes to veritable acrobats of rhetoric. If that doesn\u2019t count as a flip-flop, I don\u2019t know what does.</span></p> <p><span><i>Rena Xu \u201907, a Crimson editorial editor, is a biochemical sciences and government concentrator in Eliot House.</i></span></p>"}

Of course, many of these problems arise from decisions made early in the campaign that have come back to haunt the challenger; the idea that Kerry could run on Bush\u2019s record, now seems untenable. Even as Kerry paints a bleak picture for the future of our nation, the American people seem to recognize the stimulus to our economy brought on by tax cuts and other investment incentives, the benefits of the president\u2019s bi-partisan education reform, and most relevant to tomorrow\u2019s debate, the progress that has been made in the War on Terror.</span></p> <p><span>In presidential debates, much of the power unquestioned rhetoric holds is muted. The opportunity to respond to attacks, and systematically point out the defects behind those attacks forces the debaters to focus on facts. The debate tomorrow night will focus only on foreign policy issues, and provide the American people with the opportunity to examine each candidate\u2019s view of the world, and America\u2019s place therein. In this respect, President Bush holds a distinct advantage over John Kerry as the result of an accomplished foreign policy record over the past four years.</span></p> <p><span>We have liberated the people of Afghanistan, and freed women and other groups in that nation from the systematic persecution that preceded American intervention. Afghanistan is now preparing for elections, and will select for themselves their own fate. The actions of the Bush Administration have disrupted terrorist activities in that nation, and, to the best of our knowledge, crippled Osama bin Laden\u2019s abilities to communicate with other terrorists.</span></p> <p><span>We have secured the cooperation of Pakistan in our efforts, a reality that would have been unthinkable four years ago. Syria abandoned a weapons of mass destruction program without a shot being fired. We continue to make progress, if slowly, towards ending weapons programs in North Korea through multi-national talks and increasingly productive negotiations. With the help of the international community, we are working to end similar programs in Iran.</span></p> <p><span>In Iraq, we are restoring stability to a nation by training Iraqi security forces, delivering water and electricity to thousands of Iraqis, building roads and other infrastructure, and opening schools again. Our efforts are paying off; after years of brutal dictatorship and fear, we are on track to hold secure elections in 75 percent of the country by January of next year.</span></p> <p><span>The notion that the president mishandled Iraq is a particularly dubious assertion when coming from the mouth of John Kerry. In his speech at New York University last week, the senator said, \u201cFive months ago, in Fulton, Missouri, I said that the President was close to his last chance to get it right\u2026 [w]e must act with urgency.\u201d For all of Kerry\u2019s urgency and insistence that the situation in Iraq has been mishandled, he seems completely unable to articulate a plan of action for Iraq five months after he said we were close to our last chance to get it right.</span></p> <p><span>All of these issues will be discussed, and the rhetoric Kerry has used to belittle or otherwise understate these accomplishments will fall to the hard facts the president can stand upon.</span></p> <p><span>This debate will reveal contrasts that lie deeper than either candidate\u2019s prior successes. George W. Bush stands not only on an accomplished record, but demonstrates a sense of clarity and leadership necessary to pursue a successful War on Terror. The president, if nothing else, will be straightforward and sincere tomorrow night. This sense of honesty and clear, determined vision will undoubtedly stand in sharp contrast to his opponent\u2019s precarious pessimism, and find a resounding audience with the American people.</span></p> <p><span>In this respect, the national debate may have found an issue that transcends the importance of individual policy determinations. This election, and this debate, is not, nor should it truly be, about selecting a candidate based on individual views or nuanced opinions crafted to meet a particular demographic. The president\u2019s sudden popularity with women cannot be explained by a radical shift in the Administration\u2019s policy. Instead this election is about finding the strong, determined leader we need to carry our nation through this time of change and into an age where democracy thrives where dictatorships once were, and the treasures of freedom more completely secure the safety of those who come after us.</span></p> <p><span>In our quest to determine who possesses this leadership, there is one clear choice, and that choice will be reinforced time and again not by overt statements, but rather through the composure and steady resolve George W. Bush has consistently demonstrated over the last four years, and will demonstrate over the next.</span></p> <p><span><i>James P.M.

{"title": "No Excuses: The Case for John Kerry | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Here are a few reasons that John Kerry will be elected President on Nov. 2: 140 Harvard students made 10,000 phone calls in two hours for New Mexico; nearly 100 Harvard students campaigned in New Hampshire in the span of two weeks; nearly a third of the freshman class signed up to volunteer for John Kerry. Although we would love to give Harvard Democrats the credit, the truth is that this level of activism can be seen throughout the country.</span></p> <p><span>While the national polls show a close race, with Kerry and Bush only a couple points from each other, there are other signs that reveal John Kerry\u2019s tremendous support. Recent news articles have highlighted the amazing Democratic voter registration drives that have occurred in swing states, and major absentee voting pushes have ensured thousands of mail-in votes for Kerry in crucial states. Americans are sick and tired of a president with no answers, only excuses. From first time political volunteers to new voters, John Kerry is riding a new wave of political activism in America. As Harvard Democrats, we know there are no excuses for the failed Presidency of George W. Bush, and that there are no excuses not to volunteer for John Kerry this fall.</span></p> <p><span>The passion for Kerry begins with America\u2019s challenges at home: Kerry\u2019s domestic policies\u2014both in scope and viability\u2014are tremendously more convincing solutions to our domestic woes than Bush\u2019s fa\u00e7ade of empty promises. Kerry\u2019s economic plan emphasizes middle class tax cuts, deficit reduction, and a focus on those who most need our attention. His healthcare and jobs plans both emphasize personal choice, but also a dedication to aiding those who have been forgotten over the last four years\u2014the unemployed and the uninsured. A vote for Kerry is a vote for opportunity for every American.</span></p> <p><span>But, alas, you won\u2019t be able to hear about the striking difference between Kerry and Bush on domestic policy at tonight\u2019s debate because it focuses only on foreign policy: an arena in which the importance of electing John Kerry is most apparent. The first step in fighting any war is to acknowledge the facts on the ground. The fact is that Iraq is in dire peril and the security situation could not even be considered stable, much less conducive to the elections planned for January. President Bush botched the aftermath of the Iraq invasion, and yet he continues to promulgate the fiction that the war is going well, despite the stubborn facts.</span></p> <p><span>John Kerry accepts the grim facts about Iraq, but he also has real solutions to turn the situation around. As Kerry said in his speech last week in Philadelphia, \u201cjust because [President Bush] can\u2019t do it, doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be done.\u201d  John Kerry has the experience and judgment to fix the mess in Iraq and restore respect for America in the world. John Kerry, despite the claims of the Bush propaganda machine, has not been wobbly on the war. He voted to give the President authorization to go to Iraq because Bush promised to let the inspectors do their job, form a real coalition (right now America is bearing 90% of the costs and casualties), and plan for the aftermath.  President Bush broke all of these promises to John Kerry and to the American people. A Kerry administration would never be so rash and misleading.</span></p> <p><span>John Kerry believes in leading America into a renewed era of global leadership. While George W. Bush believes that the nations in the world offer very little to us in terms of American safety and security, John Kerry understands that the only way to fight a global war on terror is to have a global network of law enforcement and intelligence officials.  Many of the victories in the War on Terror have come due to the cooperation of other nations, and specifically with their local law enforcement.  John Kerry understands that while major deployments of American troops may sometimes be necessary (as in Tora Bora, where Bush let Afghan troops allow Al Qaeda and the Taliban to escape), real success can only be achieved through increasing global cooperation.</span></p> <p><span>John Kerry has nineteen years of experience on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and his skills in balancing American interests with diplomacy are vital for our future. John Kerry will be able to build the alliances that George Bush could not because he is in tune with the nuances of international relations. John Kerry has a solid plan to rid us of dependence on Middle Eastern oil, so that we can begin to make real changes to our policy in that region. John Kerry, when elected, will update our foreign policy\u2014bring it in tune with the realities of our world, not the fantasies of Bush\u2019s rhetoric.</span></p> <p><span>We know that the stark contrast between Kerry and Bush will be evident at tonight\u2019s debate. Kerry will offer real solutions; Bush will only offer excuses, empty promises, and misleading attacks. You can watch for yourself on the big screen at 9:00 PM tonight at the JFK Jr. Forum for the IOP\u2019s Debate-Watch.

Churchill said that the best argument against democracy is five minutes with the average citizen. \u00a0Those five minutes can sometimes also be the best argument for insane asylums. \u00a0When I asked a middle aged man which issue was most important to him this year, he responded \u201coh\u2026 issues about life.\u201d \u00a0I asked him if he was referring to, say, abortion and he said \u201cno, just life\u2026 and how it relates to everything else. \u00a0Ya know?\u201d \u00a0And then there was the woman who insisted that she wasn\u2019t racist, but that \u201csomething needs to be done about all these Hmong immigrants. \u00a0I\u2019m afraid one of these days they\u2019ll just break in and kill me,\u201d then as if to illustrate gestured to a group of Hmong children\u2014who didn\u2019t look older than 10\u2014playing next door.</span></p> <p><span>Some of the strangest people I talked to were senior citizens, and through those interactions I learned that aging and retired people are incredibly friendly to total strangers. \u00a0They\u2019d gladly invite me into their homes, reminisce about arguments they used to have with their union friends over whether to vote for Nixon, and maybe offer me a Dolly Madison or two before talking for as long as they could keep me captive. \u00a0And they vote. \u00a0Lord do they vote. \u00a0Every last one of them. \u00a0In fact, a good half of them serve as election judges, which makes them the lynchpin of the entire electoral process, a thought that\u2019s both reassuring and mildly alarming. \u00a0I met a woman who has voted for the Democrat in every presidential election since Adlai Stevenson, which is very impressive and a little sad, because what party really deserves that kind of loyalty? \u00a0And really, who wants to lose that often? \u00a0Then I saw myself in the mirror and wondered if I have fifty years of voting for losing Democrats to look forward to. \u00a0And I realized why so many old Democrats go crazy.</span></p> <p><span>So this summer I learned that I like to talk to crazy people about politics. \u00a0Eccentricity isn\u2019t just interesting, it also turns the engines of democracy. \u00a0My favorite conversation was with a man who gave me a lovely, stirring, and totally unsolicited one-on-one doorstep oration about his father\u2019s long and honorable career in public service for the state of Wisconsin. \u00a0He spoke eloquently and at length about his dad\u2019s fights for union rights and transportation funding. \u00a0And then when he had finally finished I paused awkwardly, shifted the clipboard in my hands and asked \u201cSo\u2026 are you registered to vote?\u201d</span></p>"}

But despite Kerry\u2019s myriad flaws, all magnified to fly-frying heat by the president\u2019s political fuglemen\u2014and despite the extraordinary disloyalty of a campaign staff that makes the team Al Gore \u201969 had look like a mystic cult\u2014the Democrats\u2019 larger problem goes back farther than this campaign.</span></p> <p><span>The problem, as Public Service Professor of Public Leadership David Gergen told me, is that \u201cwith a couple exceptions, Democrats have been outworked in every [presidential] election since about 1977.\u201d And I would add: Democrats have been out-innovated too.</span></p> <p><span>Those \u201ccouple exceptions\u201d are obvious: the two Clinton elections, in which a tired and hapless George H.W. Bush, and a tired and hapless Bob Dole, could not help but succumb to the honeysuckle seek-and-destroy tactics, and coherent New Democrat vision, of a political master. But even setting the Lewinsky imbroglio aside, Clinton failed to translate his personal talent into any lasting gains for his party.</span></p> <p><span>Almost as soon as Clinton, fingernails in the floor, got pried off-stage, his party returned to the same condition it endured before nominating The Man From Hope: intellectually flabby, arrogantly self-righteous and disconcertingly passive.</span></p> <p><span>Susan Estrich, manager of Michael Dukakis\u2019s presidential campaign, told me that \u201c[Democrats] seem never to have any idea of what we\u2019re in for. We tell everyone we\u2019ve learned from 1988 or 2000 or whatever but\u2026you have no idea how many times that just isn\u2019t true.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Just as Jimmy Carter\u2019s campaign failed to learn from his 1976 near-loss and let Ronald Reagan define the terms of the 1980 debate \u2026 just as Walter Mondale\u2019s campaign failed to learn from 1980\u2019s vacillation and never projected consistency\u2026just as Michael Dukakis\u2019s campaign failed to learn from 1984\u2019s interest group liberalism and ignored inoculating himself from appearing too far left\u2026just as Al Gore\u2019s campaign failed to learn from 1988 and neglected to respond fast enough, and early enough, to blunt easily-anticipated character attacks\u2026the Kerry campaign, like all the others, ignores history and is, therefore, bound to repeat it.</span></p> <p><span>And to win, the challenge is always greater than correcting what went wrong four years before.  This month alone, Bush\u2019s campaign found a new way to combine public and party funding to circumvent the law restricting its spending, forced Kerry (for the hundredth time) to step on his own message and defend a \u201cpattern of flip-flops,\u201d and produced the single most memorable advertisement of the year\u2014footage of Kerry windsurfing off Nantucket, and sailing \u201cwhichever way the wind blows\u201d on the issues.</span></p> <p><span>If presidential campaign-obsessed terrorists put a gun to my head, and demanded that I name three electioneering innovations from Kerry-Edwards, let\u2019s just say that you wouldn\u2019t see any more columns from me.</span></p> <p><span>The parties\u2019 innovation gap is not a hunger gap: this year\u2019s Democrats are more determined to win than at any time since 1992. But a partisan passion for the other side\u2019s defeat\u2014no matter how justified\u2014cannot build a winning majority, nor can sharp-elbowed campaign tactics substitute for an understandable policy vision. Democrats must match their intensity against Bush with a passion for fresh and coherent ideas.</span></p> <p><span>The Republicans found themselves in worse straits after the Watergate disaster. Midterm elections in 1974 left the party with 43 fewer House seats (down to a third of the chamber), 6 fewer governorships (down to only 12), and 21 percent fewer state legislators. Robert Teeter, a Detroit pollster hired then by the Republican National Committee to survey the wreckage, was candid in his report: \u201cWe are no longer a minority party. We have achieved the status of a minor party.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The Republicans went to work. It was during this period that they invented direct mail fundraising, following such dramatic financial insolvency that the national headquarters of the president\u2019s party was actually forced to close for a month. And after Jimmy Carter\u2019s narrow victory in 1976 the Republicans\u2014shut out of power in all three branches of national government\u2014kept on rebuilding, and not just tactically.</span></p> <p><span>A group of disillusioned former Democrats (many of them former Marxists), mostly from New York and northern California, spent these \u201cwilderness\u201d years in think tanks like the Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute. Together, they crafted what would become neo-conservatism\u2014an attack on Jimmy\u2019s Carter weakness, but mainly a new conservative agenda to end arms control, rebuild the military, aid anti-Communists and thus (they believed) defeat the Soviet Union. This was the coherent policy vision Ronald Reagan could consistently embrace; this was the program the voters of 1980 understood they would be getting.</span></p> <p><span>At a time when, according to the last NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, only 36 percent of Americans understand what John Kerry would do as president, professional Democrats must regret having spent the last four years doing little more than hating George W. Bush. To win, the party of Franklin Roosevelt and Bill Clinton (and George McGovern and Walter Mondale) must do more than learn from its past, and more than emulate the Republicans\u2019 sharp elbows. Democrats must finally build for the future.</span></p> <p><span><i>Brian M. Goldsmith is a government concentrator in Lowell House. His column appears on alternate Thursdays.</i></span></p>"}

However, Senate Majority Leader Tom Delay, R.-Texas was right to deride the ban as a meaningless \u201cfeel-good piece of legislation\u201d whic bans some guns while keeping other, equally lethal guns legal and restricts freedom without promoting safety.</span></p> <p><span>The Crimson Staff notes that the ban prohibits a few \u201cassault rifles,\u201d such as the Uzi, by name. However, gun manufacturers continue to manufacture substantially the same weapons under new names with cosmetic changes. For example, the ban prohibited the Colt AR-15, thus spawning the similarly-featured but differently-named Bushmaster 15 AR.</span></p> <p><span>The ban\u2019s list of prohibited features is even sillier. It defines an \u201cassault rifle\u201d as any semi-automatic rifle with a detachable magazine and at least two of: \u201ca folding or telescoping stock; a pistol grip that protrudes conspicuously beneath the action of the weapon; a bayonet mount; a flash suppressor or threaded barrel designed to accommodate a flash suppressor; and a grenade launcher.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>So some guns prohibited by the ban could be made legal by eliminating their folding stocks, thus making them less convenient to transport and store but no less deadly. This is akin to allowing umbrellas but prohibiting folding umbrellas. With the exception of a grenade launcher, none of these features substantially increases a weapon\u2019s deadliness; and civilians are already prohibited from owning grenades by the National Firearms Act of 1934. What these five features have in common is not that they are deadly but that they make rifles look more imposing and \u201cassaulty,\u201d especially to those who have never fired one.</span></p> <p><span>The ban\u2019s bizarre and ineffective classification of assault weapons led Tom Diaz of the Violence Policy Center, a leading gun control advocacy group, to tell NPR this March: \u201cIf the existing assault weapons ban expires, I personally do not believe it will make one whit of difference one way or another in terms of our objective, which is reducing death and injury and getting a particularly lethal class of firearms off the streets. \u00a0So if it doesn\u2019t pass, it doesn\u2019t pass.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Last summer, I had the opportunity to shoot a post-ban AR-15 knockoff. (It was a lot of fun, by the way.) \u00a0If I had decided to go on a shooting rampage\u2014which I did not feel like doing\u2014the federal government\u2019s insistence that the gun lack a bayonet mount would not have hampered me substantially. Indeed, my biggest obstacle would have been the oldest form of gun control: the fact that those around me on the shooting range also had guns with which to defend themselves.</span></p> <p><span><b></b></span></p> <p><span>JOSHUA A.

Not only was this editorial an example of the worst sort of reductive history but, sadly, it fit far too closely with the Bush administration\u2019s vocabulary of East and West, of infidels and holy Crusaders, to have been the result of objective analysis.</span></p> <p><span>Adomanis first suggests that the Byzantines would have benefited by allying themselves with the Italian city-states instead of following the \u201cshameful road of appeasement,\u201d much as (according to him) modern France would benefit from allying with America. I fear that he has lost track of how complicated the political divisions of the medieval Mediterranean really were. Constantinople fell in 1453 not because it failed to collaborate with western Europe but because of centuries of economic decline and lack of military innovation. Hastening this collapse was the brutal ambush of Constantinople by Venetian Crusaders in 1204; ignorant Christian warriors melted ancient Greek statues to sell their bronze by weight, they picked the gems out of precious Orthodox relics. \u00a0Why would residents of Constantinople ever want to ally with the pillagers of their heritage?</span></p> <p><span>Furthermore, Adomanis writes that Pera, a colony near Constantinople, suffered by forsaking \u201ca greater sense of Western kinship\u201d and failing to associate itself with Byzantium. \u00a0This sense of \u201cWestern kinship\u201d is bizarre; modern European states have a good deal more in common, in terms of political and economic infrastructure, with the Ottoman empire that with the antiquated structures of Byzantium or, for that matter, of Pera. \u00a0The only logical definition Adomanis can have in mind for \u201cWestern kinship,\u201d then, is religion. \u00a0If he will insist on defining all historical battles as binary showdowns between Christianity and Islam, he should at least be forthright about it.</span></p> <p><span>Adomanis\u2019 final \u201clesson\u201d is that we need to react early to small threats before they grow into apocalyptic battles for civilization, by which he seems to mean that the feudal states of Europe should have built a proto-alliance (of the willing) to hunt out the Ottomans when they were still just Balkan colonists. That\u2019s ridiculous for two reasons: one, battling people who don\u2019t pose a threat is a great way to over-expend resources. \u00a0Should Europe also have allied to crush the Magyars, or the medieval Bulgarians, just in case? \u00a0Moreover to suggest a parallel between the expanding Ottoman Empire and modern \u201cIslamic radicalism\u201d is the sort of conflation that allows Americans to excise the (primarily) Muslim East from our ideas of the past. Adomanis, not unlike the current administration, seeks to turn Islam into a modern and violent phenomenon instead of part of a shared global heritage.</span></p> <p><span><b></b></span></p> <p><span>SARAH K.

{"title": "Shades of Crimson | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>This is the seat of the most powerful government in the world, in one of the most diverse nations in the world, but the press corps doesn\u2019t come even close to reflecting what America looks like.\u201d Ernest R. Sotomayor\u2014president of the organization for journalists of color, UNITY\u2014said this of the Washington press corps. Although Harvard is not the most diverse school in the world, its students represent almost all ethnic backgrounds, but unfortunately The Harvard Crimson, like the Washington papers, does not reflect the diversity of the community it serves. The nation is evolving into one in which most of its residents are non-white, and with it, Harvard evolves as well. But without a more diverse staff, it is impossible for the paper to initiate conversation about all of the important issues that surround minority communities. Journalists of color bring different and crucial perspective to their articles. As a Crimson editor, I think it is important to begin actively recruiting minority students to comp The Crimson.</span></p> <p><span>This past summer UNITY released a six-month study on diversity in the Washington press with the University of Maryland\u2019s Philip Merrill College of Journalism. According to the census, less than ten percent of journalists in the Washington daily newspapers press corps are of color. It revealed a mere portion of a national trend of racial disparities among influential newspapers, one that The Harvard Crimson follows. Of the few hundred active editors that compose The Crimson\u2019s nine boards, fewer than twenty are black or Hispanic. Asian students fare better, holding approximately forty positions as editors. A more thorough accounting of the racial breakdown of all the boards of The Crimson has not been conducted; however it is safe to say that the staff is nowhere near representative of the broader community.</span></p> <p><span>These low numbers do a huge disservice to The Crimson and ethnic groups on campus alike. They harm the relationships between the two and as a result, opportunities are missed. For example, the UNITY organization that conducted the survey hosts a national conference each summer for all journalists of color that is open to both professionals and students. It is a wonderful opportunity to create valuable contacts, and this past summer it included speeches by both President Bush and presidential candidate John Kerry. Not a single Crimson staff member was in attendance. Perhaps if there were more minorities on staff, someone would have attended.</span></p> <p><span>Furthermore, certain issues and events that have had profound effects on certain ethnic groups have gone uncovered because people on The Crimson\u2019s staff had a different perspective on their magnitude. Such a situation occurred last year when the Latino and Latin American show Presencia Latina did not receive sufficient coverage in The Crimson. The President of Fuerza, Felipe Tewes, labeled the show, which included a tremendous amount of involvement by Latino students and faculty, as the biggest of its kind in Harvard\u2019s history. The Crimson ran only a picture from the show, which was held on a weekend, in its Friday Arts section. The Latino community was deeply hurt by the decision, which could be prevented in the future if more Latino students joined The Crimson\u2019s staff.</span></p> <p><span>No one party is to blame. The racial disparities on The Crimson\u2019s staff are the result of both the history of The Crimson and of ethnic groups on campus. This op-ed is an appeal to all of these organizations\u2014The Crimson included\u2014to begin actively trying to eliminate these inequities. When more students who are passionate about the issues dearest to black and Latino communities join The Crimson, the entire Harvard community will notice a significant change in the type of coverage ethnic groups receive. The UNITY study includes a suggestion toward creating a more diverse staff that The Crimson should seriously consider. It calls for papers to put a premium on diversity and establish a long-term goal and commitment to increasing minority representation on its staff. This should not be a numeric goal, but the paper should come up with creative incentives for the chairs of boards to diversify its staff.</span></p> <p><span>But The Crimson cannot decrease the disparities alone. Unfortunately, in the past, controversies such as that over Presencia Latina have caused upperclassmen to tell black and Latino freshmen and sophomores that The Crimson is an organization that does not support them, consequently discouraging them to join. This negative word of mouth needs to stop. Ethnic organizations on campus need to be dedicated and cooperative toward developing a working, healthy relationship with The Crimson, and they should seriously consider how the paper can serve as a valuable tool for their communities.</span></p> <p><span>Each of the numerous ethnic groups on campus, along with The Harvard Crimson, should view tonight\u2019s first-ever \u201cDiversity Open House\u201d as a chance to begin actively working together to decrease the racial disparities on The Crimson. All parties will have the opportunity to speak frankly with one another and to learn from Columbia professor, Arlene Morgan, an expert on diversity in newspapers.</span></p> <p><span>It is time to make a commitment toward printing a truly complete and accurate newspaper. \u201cIt can be done. We need to do it now.\u201d UNITY members wrote\u2014let\u2019s follow their lead.</span></p> <p><span><i>Monica M.

{"title": "Marshall Plan vs. Man With No Plan | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Not only has President Bush made a wreck of Iraq; he\u2019s now come out with yet another attempted rationalization for his war-without-a-point. And this one really outdoes the previous couple dozen.</span></p> <p><span>The terrorist leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, Bush noted, is \u201cstill in Baghdad creating havoc in Baghdad, trying to stop the march to democracy is what he\u2019s trying to do right now, but he was there.\u201d So you see, we invaded Iraq in order to stop folks like Zarqawi...who is now at large in Iraq taking pot shots at our troops. Mission accomplished! Never mind that before the war, the president rejected Pentagon plans to take out Zarqawi\u2019s camp with surgical strikes on three separate occasions. It\u2019s like that old saying: Why attack terrorists today when you can be engaged in an apocalyptic struggle to the death with them tomorrow?</span></p> <p><span>But while Bush acts flip about his flop in Iraq, John Kerry has made his position on the war perfectly clear: at a speech Monday at New York University, Kerry declared that he would not have invaded Iraq. He stands by his vote for authorizing the possible use of force. (Reminder for President Bush: this is the resolution you were referring to in October 2002 when you said \u201cApproving this resolution does not mean that military action is imminent or unavoidable.\u201d) But Kerry feels that force was not necessary. After all, Hussein admitted weapons inspectors, they found no WMD program, and as long as the inspectors remained in Iraq, it would have been hard for the dictator to start one.</span></p> <p><span>Ironically, in taking a reasonable and resolute stance on Iraq, Kerry has opened himself up to a new political liability. The same day Kerry gave his speech, Bush accused his opponent of believing \u201cour national security would be stronger with Saddam Hussein in power, not in prison.\u201d Bush\u2019s charge vastly over-simplifies the Iraq debate. But the silence of the Democrats on the connection between security and democracy only increases their vulnerability on the issue.</span></p> <p><span>Political scientists have long observed that democracies virtually never go to war with one another. Nations that share a democratic ethos, based on the concept of non-violent resolution of conflicts, are able to trust each other and resolve differences diplomatically. Scholars have also argued that the lack of free expression and political participation in non-democracies may be the single most inflammatory element in the volatile mix of circumstances driving individuals to join terrorist movements.</span></p> <p><span>Democrats should return to the legacy of Wilson, Roosevelt, Truman and Kennedy, and embrace the proposition that supporting the spread of democracy throughout the world is the single most effective strategy we can employ to foster global peace and defeat the rising tide of extremism. That does not mean Kerry has to concede the Iraq debate to Bush\u2014that would be like FDR forfeiting the issue of economic management to Herbert Hoover.</span></p> <p><span>This administration\u2019s strategy for imposing democracy at gunpoint is profoundly na\u00efve and completely unsustainable. Invading Iraq has made it easier for extremists to associate democratization with chaos and occupation and to paint moderate reformers working for democracy within their own countries as stooges for Western imperialism. Moreover, as insurgents gain control over ever-larger swaths of Iraq, and the CIA reports that civil war is a distinct possibility, are we honestly expected, as Bush suggested this week, to view the Iraq war as a prototype for \u201cthe advance of democracy\u201d in other regions of the world? With 145,000 troops bogged down in the Iraqi quagmire, does Bush plan to invade all or any of the scores of authoritarian regimes from North Korea to Zimbabwe? If Iraq represents Bush\u2019s plan for spreading democracy, then the president simply has no plan.</span></p> <p><span>Democrats should stand up for a more realistic approach to promoting democracy. They should demand that the administration make our support for regimes such as those in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Kazakhstan and Pakistan conditional on democratic reform in those countries. Perhaps the White House is hesitant to offend our allies in the fight against terrorism. If so, the administration does not understand how crucial democratic reform is to curbing militant extremism.</span></p> <p><span>In the spirit of the Marshall Plan, the party of Truman should also propose funding for local non-governmental organizations working to promote development. Large middle classes have historically been favorable to democracy and able to put pressure for reform on their rulers. By fostering the spread of literacy and education in the developing world, and helping a global middle class to emerge, America can encourage the diffusion of stable democracy.</span></p> <p><span>Kerry can win this debate if he tackles it head on. Instead of ducking the connection between democracy and security for fear of strengthening Bush, the senator should take the battle to the president\u2019s turf. Kerry must explain how a realistic, far-sighted approach to promoting democracy could yield real success, where Bush\u2019s policy has resulted\u2014in the president\u2019s own words\u2014in \u201ccatastrophic success.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><i>Eoghan W.

Soon after the incident, Chase says she decided to leave Kerry\u2019s store and go into business for herself.</span></p> <p><span>Since then, Chase has forged an impeccable reputation for herself in the cooking industry, hobnobbing with household names such as Julia Childs, Jacques Pepin and Martha Stewart. She also opened and ran for 10 years a successful Nantucket food business and serves as culinary spokesperson for Butterball Turkey and Hellmann\u2019s Mayonnaise.</span></p> <p><span>Chase\u2019s reputation in food circles derives from her first cookbook, The Silver Palate Good Times Cookbook, which she co-authored in 1984 and immediately hit The New York Times bestseller list. She has continued to write, penning an additional five cookbooks to date along with her first, which together have sold 1.5 million copies nationwide.</span></p> <p><span>In these cookbooks and in her weekly food columns for The Nantucket Spectator, Chase prides herself on blending episodes from her life, such as her brief stint in Kerry\u2019s bakery, with her passion for fine food, making her cookbooks a window into her world.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI love writing about the outside stories behind the recipes.

Her love of experimenting with recipes came first, followed by the development of her literary skills\u2014necessary for success in her industry\u2014at Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI see myself as part of a generation that was able to marry intellect with food, to take it from just being a vocation to something that is highly respected,\u201d Chase says.</span></p> <p><span>Chase\u2019s first brush with gourmet cooking came at age 13, when she served as cook at the Nantucket home of her aunt and uncle. For several months, she furnished the family with three meals a day. She also catered their weekly dinner parties using ingredients that had been grown locally.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI got used to buying swordfish meat from the local fish market, and fresh fruits, vegetables and flowers came from the back of a truck that was parked on the cobblestone street. I would take the meat and vegetables home, then help my uncle grill them on an outdoor grill,\u201d she says. \u201cMy duties quickly spilled over into the kitchen.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Like in these early years, Nantucket has guided much of her culinary career. While Chase says she has never attended cooking school, she learned to cook by relying on local fruits, vegetables and meats that are staples on Nantucket. Chase\u2019s Nantucket Open House Cookbook, published in 1987, introduces hundreds of recipes of her creation, including curried lentil soup with chutney butter, parmesan lasagna and braised lamb shanks with bourbon-barbeque sauce.</span></p> <p><span>Chase, self-acknowledged as one of the \u201cnew breed of chefs during the mega-trend \u201980s,\u201d admits in the introduction to one chapter of the cookbook, \u201cI find the recipes...magnificent.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><b>MIXING IT UP</b></span></p> <p><span>Chase says she has always been one to experiment with new ideas.

Most of the graduates went on to factory jobs, putting in zippers for the rest of their lives,\u201d she adds.</span></p> <p><span>After a year at Middlebury College\u2014\u201ctoo rustic, I was too feminine for them\u201d\u2014and another year at Wellesley College\u2014\u201cI didn\u2019t fit in with most of the girls there\u201d\u2014Chase transferred to Harvard in fall 1976.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI had wanted to go to Harvard always,\u201d she says. \u201cI am very strong willed. It took me three applications, but I finally got in.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Yet after flipping through the pages of Nantucket Open House Cookbook, some might wonder how Chase managed to blend her academic curiosity with her love of fine food\u2014how she succeeded in transforming a A.B. degree from Harvard, magna cum laude, into comprehensive knowledge of pumpkin prosciutto and Parmesan lasagna.</span></p> <p><span>As an undergraduate, Chase says she balanced her coursework in European intellectual history with her love of experimenting with new recipes in an Adams House student kitchen. During her two years here, she also worked at a French restaurant in the Garage on Mount Auburn Street and cooked weekly dinner parties for a Cambridge host.</span></p> <p><span>Chase recalls that Julia Childs, her idol, lived across the street from her boss.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI kept hoping I would get to knock on her door and borrow a cup of sugar,\u201d she says.</span></p> <p><span>Childs served as more of an example than any history professor Chase had encountered.</span></p> <p><span>Chase\u2019s passion for cooking even overshadowed her senior thesis, \u201cChaos as a Form of Theory.\u201d She remembers her formidable stack of thesis research \u201cpaled in comparison\u201d to the even more impressive pile of Gourmet magazines lying nearby in her room.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhenever I got into the kitchen, I had this feeling of knowing that this was exactly what I wanted to do,\u201d Chase says.</span></p> <p><span><b>RECIPE FOR SUCCESS</b></span></p> <p><span>Chase rejects the notion that success is derived from a formula.</span></p> <p><span>After graduation, she considered submitting applications to business school, medical school and law school. Ultimately, she says she \u201cdidn\u2019t want acceptance into one of these places to determine the course of my life.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to be bound by doing the same thing day in and day out,\u201d Chase says.</span></p> <p><span>Instead of a generic career path, Chase moved back to Nantucket and opened her first restaurant, which she named \u201cQue Sera Sarah.\u201d The store name was ambiguous enough to reflect a variety of endeavors, Chase says. In this way, she reasoned, if the food venture failed, she could turn it into something else and retain the name.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis was a question on my mind always in those days,\u201d Chase says. \u201cWhat ever will be me?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Yet the venture was an instant success with Nantucket residents, as it provided a broad range array of Mediterranean dishes to an elite clientele. Chase says that the original menu included couscous salads, wrapped grape leaves and pizzas\u2014\u201canything that appealed to my taste buds.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Chase says that she modelled her store after European cuisine.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI went on a bicycle trip from Paris to Vienna one year and fell in love with the European way of living,\u201d she says.</span></p> <p><span>Toby A. Greenberg has been a Nantucket summer resident for 40 years and says that Chase created a \u201chappy environment\u201d in her new store.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe food was wonderful, always delicious and fresh,\u201d Greenberg says. \u201cSarah was brilliant, she never took culinary classes but just learned by doing.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Chase was only 27 when she started a venture that would earn her fame in the culinary world. At that age, she was invited to join a new cookbook project,</span></p> <p><span>The Silver Palate Good Times Cookbook. Within weeks Chase\u2019s writing skills\u2014honed at Harvard\u2014brought her into the spotlight. Seeing that Chase was the best writer among the team of culinary experts, the project directors hired Chase to actually pen the cookbook. In a very short time, Chase went from small town business owner to minor celebrity.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cDriving down Fifth Avenue in a limousine, I got such a thrill from seeing my book in Saks and in the bookstore windows,\u201d Chase says. \u201cI realized how much I liked writing about food, and now I had an entree into the publishing world.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><b>BLENDING FAMILY AND CAREER</b></span></p> <p><span>Chase continues to earn recognition as a top name in food circles. After selling Que Sera Sarah in 1989, she assembled a new career from a variety of her interests: travel, freelance writing, teaching and consulting. During this time, Chase says she met her husband, who was also in the food industry, at a Burgundy wine tasting dinner on Nantucket. They were married in 1995, and their son, Nigel\u2014 \u201cthe best thing we ever cooked up\u201d\u2014 arrived in 1997.</span></p> <p><span>Chase says she envisions herself more as a guardian of old American cultural traditions than as a revolutionary in the gourmet world of cooking.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI see my work as part of a way of life that is fading from our modern lives,\u201d she says.</span></p> <p><span>Despite the reputation Chase has carved among professionals, she remains above all else a dedicated mother and wife. Chase says that she does not take shortcuts when cooking for her family, citing how she regularly cooks Nigel\u2019s favorite meal, lollipop lambchops and potatoes\u2014a recipe included in her book, Pedalling Through Provence Cookbook: A Taste of My Travels.</span></p> <p><span>Chase says that raising a family has merited certain sacrifices to her career.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMy powers of concentration are not the same as before I had a child,\u201d Chase says.</span></p> <p><span>Jonathan D. Chase \u201977\u2014Chase\u2019s brother and a self-taught chef of Deer Isle, Maine\u2014disagrees. He says his sister\u2019s \u201cpassion for wine, food and everything that goes with it has not diminished\u201d since the birth of her son.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe primary focus in her life right now is running a household and being a mother,\u201d Jonathan Chase says. \u201cThat\u2019s a full-time job.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>This Brother and sister culinary duo collaborated in 1992 to produce Saltwater Seasonings: Good Food from Coastal Maine, which included classic recipes such as Maine baked beans, fish chowder, strawberry shortcake and blueberry pie.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe\u2019re a very food-oriented family,\u201d Jonathan Chase says. \u201cOur grandmother was a good cook, our mother was a good cook, so we learned at an early age not to settle for less than really good food.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Chase says that her son Nigel, who is now six years old, will accompany her to her 25th reunion. In preparation for the event, Chase has participated on the Food Committee for her class, negotiating with the event caterer until he agreed to reduce the price of the Class of 1979\u2019s clambake from $90,000 to $50,000.</span></p> <p><span>Still, Chase does not see being \u201cbusiness savvy\u201d as her most important quality.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI have integrity,\u201d she says. \u201cI have not gone bankrupt, but I have not made vast fortunes either.

I shouldn\u2019t say I was pleasantly surprised\u2014I found the feature articles dull, the poetry overwrought and the interviews middling. But the co-founders\u2019 glib pronouncement on the editor\u2019s note that the magazine \u201cIsn\u2019t quite what you expected, is it?\u201d holds true enough.</span></p> <p><span>The semi-nude pictures it does contain are self-parodying, pointless or nothing edgy. A few articles and interviews address the ambiguous divide between art and porn, making the editors\u2019 pronouncement \u201c[H Bomb] isn\u2019t porn, that\u2019s for sure\u201d seem painfully ironic and, by their own standards, simple-minded. Of course, it\u2019s all part of the game\u2014a full-page advertisement for Playboy (page 28) might signal something. And if Playboy is porn encased within misfit cerebral articles, then H Bomb is merely just an even more smug rendition of Playboy.</span></p> <p><span>All in all, the publication is a masturbatory affair\u2014and not in the sense of the article on page 43.</span></p> <p><span>So, perhaps we can strike a middle ground\u2014it\u2019s not porn, and it\u2019s not art. Rather, it\u2019s a $9,000 excursion into the pump-priming of professional photographers, printers and legal counsel.</span></p> <p><span>What continues to be puzzling is why the Undergraduate Council would award $2,000 to a publication so titillating that it could clearly garner enough advertisers to make do, while requests for community service projects and rape prevention events received only a marginal amount of their requests. Indeed, H Bomb may well make a profit if the magazine sells to enough outsiders for the $5 apiece cover price\u2014which will surely happen if the founders can stress the magazine\u2019s provocative allure (a porn mag for Harvard students?!) over the mundane and self-absorbed reality.</span></p> <p><span>\u2022 <b>Kofi, How Could You?</b></span></p> <p><span>The recent refrain of Democrats and the 9/11 Commission has been one of anger that the Bush administration did not do enough to stop terrorist attacks before they happened on American soil. And if they can make a specifics-filled case that shows where and when Bush failed, then they will make a strong point. Yet, whatever ferocity has come down upon the Bush administration for not doing enough before 9/11 to stop terrorist attacks should come down tenfold on U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who will be this year\u2019s Commencement speaker.</span></p> <p><span>During his time in the Secretariat, he has hardly proved a competent official willing to take political chances to save innocents\u2019 lives. As head of the U.N.\u2019s peacekeeping operations, his intentionally muddled directives made for confusion amidst blue helmets in Bosnia, leaving them unable to militarily defend towns that were designated as \u201csafe zones.\u201d His failure to clarify this language, even after he was asked to by several commanders, led Dutch peacekeepers in Srebrenica to simply stay inside their barracks, rather than stop the Bosnian Serb military from massacring 7,000 Muslim refugees. Ultimately, the event forced the Dutch prime minister to resign his position in 2002 when a report was released assigning blame to the peacekeepers and the U.N. So why the impunity for Annan?</span></p> <p><span>Even if Annan isn\u2019t directly held responsible for the failures of this department, he\u2019s certainly an unexceptional administrator. To boot, a scandal to rival liberals\u2019 favorite refrains about Bush\u2019s oil ties is in the works currently at Rockefeller Center. Instead of alleged conflict of interests with Halliburton, however, the recent scandal from the Oil-for-Food program is quite real. In this instance, while Saddam was skimming money off his side of the budget to pay sympathizers in other countries that kept his regime afloat diplomatically, Kofi made sure a Swiss company where his son, Kojo, was a top consultant won a large contract for the program.</span></p> <p><span>Yet, whereas those upset with Dick Cheney\u2019s secret energy powwows have taken him to court, Annan is in the comfortable position of having the authority (since the U.N. hardly has the types of checks and balances legitimate governmental organizations do) to suppress whatever reports he want. And, in this case, 50 Oil-for-Food audit reports have underwent this same fate\u2014even as Annan declares he knows nothing about the whole situation.</span></p> <p><span>An exemplar of world peace and global ethics for Harvard\u2019s Commencement ceremonies? Hardly.</span></p> <p><span>\u2022 <b>A Truly Liberal Education</b></span></p> <p><span>Even \u201cprogressives\u201d have to realize there is a lot to legitimately complain about in Harvard\u2019s curriculum at a time when a class that focuses around uniformly left-wing celebrity interviews and culminates in a take-home exam enjoys the second-highest enrollment in the College.</span></p> <p><span>But, to give credit where credit is due, only the margins of Harvard\u2014the Committee on Degrees in the Studies of Women, Gender and Sexuality and those courses taught by departing Lecturer on the Study of Religion Brian C.W. Palmer \u201986\u2014are totally closed off to dissenting voices. The recent appointment of Niall Ferguson, who will enjoy a dual appointment to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and Harvard Business School,  proves this well enough. His apologia for the British empire and his recent argument that America is and <i>should</i> be an empire are hardly popular ones to make in these post-colonial days. Yet, his voice is not merely being tolerated, but embraced\u2014he\u2019s been invited to give a number of lectures in Cambridge since the announcement, and most of his future colleagues seem elated to work with Ferguson.</span></p> <p><span>Even if George W. Bush may never enjoy a debate that is anything more than a shouting match at Harvard, the Huntingtons, Mansfields and, soon, Fergusons of the academy might keep a more subtle discourse going.</span></p> <p><span><i>Travis R.

{"title": "Our Manmohan in India | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Bush and Kerry are working hard to drum up support, but neither, to date, has received any letters written in blood urging them to be president\u2014at least not from prominent politicians. But then, not every country can have such drama-packed politics as India. First the incumbent prime minister and his Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party were trounced by India\u2019s Congress party, under the leadership of Sonia Gandhi, the Italian-born wife and daughter-in-law of two former prime ministers. Then Gandhi declared that she would decline the post she had just won, prompting members of her party to descend on her home in droves, some of them writing letters in their own blood urging her to change her mind, others threatening to commit suicide if she did not assume the leadership of the country.</span></p> <p><span>Nonetheless, Gandhi stuck by her decision and, as a result, a rather promising leader has been catapulted to India\u2019s helm in her place, Manmohan Singh, an Oxford-educated economist. This shake-up could prove historic for India and provide America with a chance to turn over a new leaf in our behavior toward the nation, which has been less than considerate lately.</span></p> <p><span>As a Sikh, Singh is the first member of a religious minority to lead India. As an advocate of secular government, he will be a welcome antidote to outgoing Prime Minister Vajpayee who once declared, \u201cThese days militancy in the name of Islam leaves no room for tolerance. Wherever such Muslims live, they tend not to live in coexistence.\u201d And under Singh\u2019s tenure, India could begin to emerge from large-scale poverty. As finance minister in the early 1990s, Singh began the effort to scale back India\u2019s mammoth bureaucracy. At the same time, Singh acknowledges that much work needs to be done to spread the benefits of India\u2019s economic growth to the rural majority.</span></p> <p><span>America should take this opportunity to reengage with a vital regional ally with tangible gestures of goodwill. To begin with, the demonizing of outsourcing, which can be heard from both parties, needs to end. It\u2019s easy for politicians to forget when they attack \u201cjobs going to India,\u201d that millions of workers and families in India desperately need that investment. Besides, allowing capital to go where it is most productive means cheaper products for American consumers, too, and cheaper inputs for domestic American business. Instead of throwing sand in the gears of globalization, we should ensure that the benefits of trade reach all Americans, through adequate investments in higher education, social services and a safety net capable of catching those who temporarily lose their jobs in the shuffle. (Hint: slashing taxes and creating deficits that undermine our ability to pay for such programs does not make that effort any easier.)</span></p> <p><span>We also need to rethink our chummy support for Pakistan\u2019s military regime. Referring to the beneficiary (and initiator) of a military coup as \u201ca courageous leader and a friend of the United States,\u201d as Bush has described President Musharaff, and inviting him to take part in joint press conferences with the Secretary of Defense, sends the wrong message about America\u2019s commitment to democracy. In fact, as The American Prospect recently pointed out, our government\u2019s financial support for brutal authoritarian regimes throughout Central Asia has increased substantially since September 11. It\u2019s hard to imagine what could be more shortsighted than fighting terror by undermining democracy. At the same time, by showering affection on India\u2019s autocratic neighbors, we cheapen our ties with India itself.</span></p> <p><span>America could also demonstrate support for Mr. Singh\u2019s commitment to sound development policies, by increasing our paltry development aid to India. We spend a pittance on development in general (less than 16 billion dollars last year, or about 0.014 percent of our Gross National Product). But we spend a pitiful portion of that pittance on South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa: just $3 billion. A real commitment to India\u2019s development would not only reward their market-based approach to fighting poverty, but also help solidify the bond between our two nations.</span></p> <p><span>The U.S. can\u2019t just dabble in democracy promotion. Toppling a couple regimes won\u2019t prove our commitment to spreading democracy if we don\u2019t also support our long-time democratic allies and reward efforts toward prosperity and religious pluralism which sustain democracy. As we try to win the support of Iraqis, strengthen the pro-democracy elements of Iran\u2019s civil society against their theocratic rulers and inspire people from North Korea to Libya to dream of self-governance, we have to stand behind countries like India. In our quest for the hearts and minds of peoples across the world, ending our policy of malign neglect toward India would make an \u201cin-Delhi-able\u201d impression.</span></p> <p><span><i>Eoghan W.

{"title": "Keep the Paper Trail | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>It is often remarked that Americans\u2014hardheaded hegemons\u2014never learn from their mistakes. Egregious lapses in foresight, ill-fated invasions and the illiberal use of diplomatic finesse are common fodder for this critique. But this coming November, voters can\u2019t play the part of imprudent Americans. As the future of the country rests on the results of the upcoming presidential election, they must learn from the debacle last time around in 2000 and demand curbs to the troubling new trend of electronic voting. Without a tangible record of the votes\u2014a \u201cpaper trail\u201d of cast ballots\u2014there remains the potential that Americans will once again witness a mockery of one of the most important events of the decade.</span></p> <p><span>The market for electronic voting machines boomed following the circumstances of the 2000 election in Florida. After the debacle, state officials began searching for new methods to facilitate voting and thus prevent another contentious election. Following California\u2019s lead, many states began the transition from traditional punch card ballots to touch screen systems; yet, since the start of the switchover, many critics have come forth claiming that current systems are insufficiently equipped to stave off the threat of malfunction or manipulation. Therefore, many are calling for a paper trail, or \u201cballot receipts,\u201d to ensure that in the event of a close or contested election, officials will have evidence of the actual votes. We feel strongly that this is a necessary precaution.</span></p> <p><span>Opponents of this proposal, however, argue that the paper trail is unnecessary and will prove cumbersome to the voting process. According to an article in The New York Times, critics of attaching a printer to current and future electronic voting machines\u2014so voters can \u201cconfirm\u201d their ballot\u2014cite \u201cpaper jams, voter confusion and delays in the voting booth while voters read their receipts,\u201d as potential disincentives to vote. But, at present, studies show that electronic voting systems are not currently designed to ensure we won\u2019t witness another 2000 election, a concern that should trump added inconvenience.</span></p> <p><span>In July 2003, Aviel D. Rubin, a professor from Johns Hopkins University, published an in-depth security analysis of the electronic voting machines manufactured by Diebold Inc.\u2014one of the primary companies to benefit from the transition to touch screen voting. The report was full of criticisms of the company\u2019s system and claimed that Diebold\u2019s \u201cvoting system is far below even the most minimal security standards applicable in other contexts.\u201d The report highlighted many of the potential dangers stemming from the nature of technology\u2014essentially, that malfunctions are often unforeseeable\u2014and the threat of \u201ca wide range of attacks, including ballot stuffing by voters and incorrect tallying by insiders.\u201d Until these considerable concerns are addressed, there is no legitimate reason to oppose a paper trail.</span></p> <p><span>Ideally, we wouldn\u2019t have to worry about tangible evidence to ensure the fair outcome of a presidential election. Other countries have gotten there\u2014just look at the rather healthy system of electronic voting that exists in Australia. According to an article featured on Wired.com, \u201cAustralians designed a system [in 2001] that addressed and eased most of those concerns: They chose to make the software running their system completely open to public scrutiny.\u201d That is, whereas Diebold chose to keep its software coding secret until it was finally leaked and posted on the web\u2014and subsequently scrutinized by Avriel and his associates\u2014the private Australian company had no qualms in providing their operating software in order to ensure voter confidence in the process.</span></p> <p><span>But Diebold\u2019s secrecy and public resistance of the proposed paper trails may not simply involve matters of marketing. After discovering that Diebold\u2019s Chairman, Walden O\u2019Dell, and other members of the company\u2019s board are significant Bush benefactors, their intentions of opposing a ballot receipts remained appropriately suspect to many of the proposal\u2019s proponents. As long as the company\u2019s software security remains inept at guaranteeing a fair and clean election, electronic voting without paper evidence leaves Diebold\u2019s intentions dubious. To ensure that voter confidence is at its utmost, and to make certain that we don\u2019t fall prey to mistakes made in the 2000 election, we must make sure that there\u2019s a paper trail this November.</span></p>"}
{"title": "The Liberal Art of Redefinition | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Last year, I wrote that the American left is losing a struggle for language, as conservatives masterfully redefine the political lexicon. Now, going into an election year, many don\u2019t see a \u201cmessage\u201d in the rhetoric of the Left\u2019s titular leader, the presumptive Democratic nominee, John Kerry. Perhaps that message would be clearer if it were framed in a vocabulary that seeks to reclaim the meanings of words that have been poisoned by years of insincerity and extremism. Establishing a new vocabulary is not the point; we need to take the old vocabulary and make it make sense again. Here are a few suggested entries for a recovered dictionary:</span></p> <p><span><b>Compassion.</b></span></p> <p><span>I\u2019m not talking about George Bush compassion\u2014or, for that matter, Bill Clinton compassion, which had more to do with style than with policy. Compassion needs to be redefined for what it is\u2014the human capacity to feel another\u2019s suffering as one\u2019s own. In a startlingly divided nation and a broken world, compassion forms the basis for some kind of unity. It means that I, bleary-eyed from studying for exams, have something in common with the underpaid janitor I step past on the way to the dining hall, who is bleary-eyed from working two jobs to support his family. It also means that I have something in common with the Iranian student, also exhausted from preparing for exams, but with more on her mind than tests because she is as involved in a youth democracy protest movement as I am involved in the Institute of Politics. Politically, it means that we take those to task who cause suffering, whether they are treating their employees unfairly or suppressing protest in the streets. The latter is a principle that should motivate our dealings with states as varied as Israel and Saudi Arabia, to take one exemplary region. The former is its domestic counterpart, the belief that human suffering occurs in the everyday, literally in the spaces we share, and that it can be prevented by intelligent taxation and regulation. Whoever tells you this is class warfare is a class warrior of the worst kind: the point of compassionate policy is to regard people as people, without regard to class, having an equal claim on fairness and prosperity.</span></p> <p><span><b>Strength.</b></span></p> <p><span>Again, this has nothing to do with neoconservative strength, the strength to use force wherever we\u2019d like to see change. In fact, the test is often whether we have the strength to not use force. Think of the strength it would have required, in the winter months of 2003, to hold our troops ready outside Iraq until we were dead certain that Saddam had weapons capabilities that threatened our nation. And think of the strength it would have taken to pull the troops back once Hans Blix\u2019s UN inspection team confirmed that a combination of inspections and the threat of force had succeeded in disarming Iraq without a shot being fired. How\u2019s that for a steady hand in times of terror? The point is not to ignore threats, but rather to ignore fear, especially when fear itself becomes a threat to peace. Real strength also means finishing what you start\u2014a call going unanswered in the deteriorating nation of Afghanistan. Our greatest success in Afghanistan is that its chief export is once again drugs instead of terrorism. The President, Hamid Karzai, is effectively the mayor of Kabul, beyond whose borders power lies in the hands of warlords and, increasingly, the Taliban. (Did you know the Taliban still exists?) The world knows that one of the best ways to evaluate strength is to see if a power can keep its promises: Afghanistan stands today as a monument to American weakness.</span></p> <p><span><b>Morality.</b></span></p> <p><span>No word has been more regrettably hijacked in politics than \u201cmorality.\u201d  Somewhere along the line, its political meaning came to encompass only private morality, the morality of sleeping only with one\u2019s spouse and, if possible, not being a lawyer. It is an enduring outrage of the Clinton era that men who spent their careers undermining human rights, international order and social justice made their names in Congress by positioning themselves as defenders of a morality defined exclusively by sexual conduct. These cannot be the boundaries of morality. There is such a thing as civic, public morality, and it belongs in the vocabulary of any serious politician because there can be no more serious motivation for public service. Because it is characterized by real compassion and strength, public morality includes acknowledging the humanity and rights of homosexuals, though peddlers of hate invoke it to do the opposite. Morality demands consistency in making human rights a guiding premise of foreign policy, not just a retroactive justification for fear-driven combat adventures. And it means that images and evidence of our moral failures should be taken as a stimulus for conscience, not a sign of the need to restrict cameras and protect against leaks.</span></p> <p><span>If you think this outline is about as specific as President Bush\u2019s plan for rebuilding Iraq, forgive me.

{"title": "Pumping Up Energy Policy | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>With gas prices at the pump now exceeding two dollars in most states, the finger pointing has begun on both sides of the aisle to determine who is responsible for oil supply problems. Unfortunately, supply is not the major cause of these price rises. Runaway economic growth in China and India is, and it has been for some time now as the two Asian giants continue to modernize their economies. Short of trying to derail economic growth in the world\u2019s two most populous nations, there is very little the United States government can do to stop worldwide demand for oil increasing. Much like the experience of the U.S. during the early 1980s, there is little that can be done to reduce our dependence on foreign oil aside from consuming less of it.</span></p> <p><span>Energy policy in the United States has a history of being highly politicized and badly timed. President Carter\u2019s efforts to improve fuel efficiency came too little too late as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries began restricting supply and the Iran-Iraq war started. Opportunities to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil were largely ignored under Reagan and Bush Sr. and were not a top priority during the Clinton administration when oil prices were historically low. However, the current Bush administration has broken new ground in irresponsible policy-making with the current energy bill, which is deadlocked in the Senate. Not only does the bill contain $25 billion in pork barreling, it does absolutely nothing to deal with U.S. energy demand in the future and instead includes a number of politically motivated provisions to satisfy favored industry groups. For instance, drilling the Antarctic National Wildlife Refuge, a key proposal in the bill, is unlikely to have any substantial benefit for reducing U.S. dependence on foreign oil, as is leaving SUV\u2019s exempt from fuel efficiency standards on the basis that they are utility vehicles.</span></p> <p><span>Real answers to U.S. energy problems have largely been left to sit in dusty energy journals for the last 15 years and have only recently begun to have any focus in mainstream politics. Improving Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards and rethinking the multitude of SUV exemptions are now on the table, as well as considering an oil import tax combined with a tax cut to ensure low income earners are not disadvantaged. These moves could substantially reduce the amount of oil the U.S. uses over the long run and reduce the exposure it has to political instability in the Middle East. The problem is that these kinds of changes need bipartisan political commitment, something that has sorely been lacking in Congress thus far. With an executive branch that is determined to force through a shopping list of gimmes likely received from energy industry groups in secretive consultations with Vice President Cheney and his energy taskforce, there is not much hope for decisive action on energy policy before the election.</span></p>"}

Sadly, you conclude by endorsing the Democrats.</span></p> <p><span>Although the Harvard Initiative for Peace and Justice (HIPJ) has no official position on Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., many of us are troubled by his platform. As students concerned with U.S. foreign policy we cannot help noticing that Kerry has promised to continue many of the policies of the Bush administration. In particular, he proudly supported the war in Afghanistan, plans to send more troops to Iraq, supports continued sanctions against Cuba, and has aggressively attacked the Chavez government in Venezuela while defending Israel\u2019s atrocious actions in Palestine. He has been silent on America\u2019s continuing support for dictators from Uzbekistan to Nepal and it is safe to assume that he will perpetuate these inhuman policies that take their toll on millions worldwide.</span></p> <p><span>American foreign policy, which is a  result of an economic system dominated by huge corporations and an ethnocentric domestic discourse, is fundamentally flawed.  John Kerry,  accused of war crimes in Vietnam, backed by corporate interests and  working within the same systemic parameters, portends to be only mildly better than President George W. Bush.</span></p> <p><span>Frankly, the writers of this letter feel that by supporting a strategy of \u201cAnybody but Bush,\u201d the Left only enables Kerry to pursue a platform as similar to Bush\u2019s as possible. At the least, progressives need to push Kerry towards providing a true alternative to Bush whether by lobbying, public demonstration, or, god forbid, threatening to vote for Nader.  We must build a vibrant, independent Left that remains disinterested from Kerry\u2019s Bush-like flailings\u2014not just because this is the only way to sway the Democrats, but so we can move beyond the two-party system.</span></p> <p><span>SUVRAT RAJU</span></p> <p><span>ERIC OLAF POTMA</span></p> <p><span>HUIBIN AMELIA CHEW \u201904</span></p> <p><span>May 17, 2004</span></p> <p><span><i>The writers are members of the Harvard Initiative for Peace and Justice.</i></span></p>"}
{"title": "Fact or Fiction? | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>When the scandal first broke back in March it sounded too ripe to believe. The Bush Administration had produced faux-news segments in which an actor portraying a reporter touts the benefits of the contentious new Medicare bill that had only just narrowly passed through Congress. Two of the videos end with the reporter signing off, \u201cIn Washington, I\u2019m Karen Ryan reporting.\u201d Committed to propagandizing equally to all persons, regardless of ethnicity or national origin, the Administration also produced a third video narrated in Spanish and featuring the hard-hitting reporting of \u201cAlberto Garcia.\u201d  The White House then distributed the three videos to television news stations without clearly indicating their origins. In all, 40 stations around the country broadcast the segments. Many simply integrated the videos into their regularly scheduled news broadcasts; viewers were left clueless.</span></p> <p><span>In a slightly baffling defense, the White House persistently insisted that Karen Ryan really was a freelance reporter and not, despite all indications, an actress. Unfortunately for Karen and her budding press career\u2014and for the White House and its rapidly diminishing credibility\u2014a prompt investigation by the Columbia Journalism Review quickly proved otherwise. More predictably, Administration officials insisted that all the fuss was for nothing: the videos were simply objective and informative pieces, meant to help educate Americans about the changes in Medicare and how they could best take advantage of their new prescription drug benefits.</span></p> <p><span>Last Wednesday, the non-partisan Congressional General Accounting Office (GAO) begged to differ, ruling that the videos were in serious violation of Federal anti-propaganda laws. In addition to failing to alert viewers that the videos had been  produced with their own tax dollars by the Department of Health and Human Services, the GAO asserted that the videos\u2019 included \u201cnotable omissions and weaknesses\u201d in their coverage of the new Medicare law.</span></p> <p><span>The irony is that while the Administration was busy packaging politics as news, the news is itself becoming ever more politicized. The whole Medicare video ploy rested on the assumption that viewers would swallow the message with greater credulity if it were framed as journalism. But if the Bush Administration plans to stick with this strategy, it better get to work preserving Americans\u2019 trust in the news.</span></p> <p><span>Lately, the objectivity of American media coverage has come in for a close bit of scrutiny. Michael Moore\u2019s new film \u201cFarenheit 9-11,\u201d which won the Palme d\u2019Or at Cannes on Saturday, has reportedly shocked many viewers with its graphic footage from Iraq\u2014footage that is rarely shown on American news. And it\u2019s not just Moore. The polemicists over at PBS will also be airing a documentary this July entitled \u201cWar Feels Like War,\u201d which paints much the same picture.</span></p> <p><span>This media sanitization may just reflect skittish news producers, but it obviously also serves\u2014intentionally, or not\u2014certain political ends. Just think back to the Bush Administration\u2019s refusal to allow the media to air video footage of the flag draped coffins as they return from Iraq. Their justification: publicizing the anonymous images would violate the privacy of the victims\u2019 families. Privacy?  Come on, that\u2019s so pre 9-11. Someone needs to tell these guys about the Patriot Act.</span></p> <p><span>This sort of deference is, of course, nothing new. In March of 2003, as the nation prepared for war, a leaked British intelligence memo revealed that the American National Security Agency (NSA) was conducting a joint operation with the British. Turns out the government was bugging the New York offices and residences of U.N. Security Council members as part of its strategy to secure an authorization for the imminent invasion. Sounds like a pretty big scandal, no? The New York Times and most other major American media didn\u2019t seem to think so; they decided to pass on the story.</span></p> <p><span>I don\u2019t want to sound too paranoid or cynical. After all, the last few months have also witnessed some first-rate investigative reporting into the Abu Ghraib scandal by the New Yorker\u2019s Seymour Hersh, and 60 Minutes II. But journalists who cross the White House should be forewarned\u2014this is an Administration known for blacklisting its perceived enemies in the press corps, withholding interviews and other goodies. You can hardly blame journalists for worrying that an indiscrete article or bit of footage might land them out on the street, looking for work with Karen and Alberto.</span></p> <p><span><i>Sasha Post \u201905 is a social studies concentrator in Adams House.

{"title": "Bush's Last Chance in Iraq to Avoid Early Withdrawl | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Jonathan Moore", "body": "<p><span>President Bush is now in danger of the furor over the Abu Ghraib prison horrors engulfing U.S. strategy toward Iraq at the very moment he faces huge last-chance political and military decisions there.</span></p> <p><span>After June 30, Iraq will become a no man\u2019s land. Everything about this next phase smacks of confusion and danger, even without the impact of the abuses by American personnel of Iraqi prisoners: semi-sovereignty mixed with insurrection, protracted ethnic-religious strife and discord over the nature of the yet-unformed permanent government. The U.S. military role will be subject to challenge under a quasi-Iraqi regime; both the definition of the U.N. mandate and U.S. support for it are up for grabs; international engagement is reticent; and the backing of the Iraqi people for a caretaker government indeterminate in both structure and jurisdiction can easily implode.</span></p> <p><span>The administration doesn\u2019t seem to realize that the opportunity for avoiding catastrophe in Iraq has all but slipped away in the face of its unwillingness to recast its strategy. Does it not comprehend the mess it\u2019s in? Or is it paralyzed by the recognition of its predicament, lured by the conceit that any reality can be twisted into political advantage, or busied with planning for some other move we don\u2019t know about?  The situation may already be unrecoverable, even if the U.S. acts boldly and quickly. But without a final attempt, we will almost surely be facing the precipitous withdrawal with fearful consequences for Iraq, the global credibility of U.S. foreign policy and American politics.</span></p> <p><span>The trouble we are in can be revealed by the recognition that the best available strategy now is the same one we rejected six months ago and continues to grow less viable every passing day.</span></p> <p><span>First, the U.S. still needs to establish and sustain the security in Iraq\u2014a responsibility it originally assigned itself but has never accomplished. Only we can do this. But without enough manpower and better logistics and equipment to intimidate the insurgency, the resistance forces have erupted and now will be much harder to put down. Despite the still concealed but ever-growing budget for Iraq, more troops are required to quash current violence and deter further insecurity. To pursue our continuing military obligations on the cheap endangers both our soldiers and the chances for avoiding real civil war in Iraq. But the domestic problems larger troop deployments would precipitate, with the military (regular, reserves and national guard) and their families, even without increased American coffins, are woeful to consider.</span></p> <p><span>Second, the U.S. still should turn over unambiguous authority for both the political and reconstruction agendas to the United Nations, which should act in concert with other multilateral authorities. Certainly, U.S. must continue to play an essential supporting role, but the U.N. can earn credibility inside Iraq and can attract broad international participation, both of which are currently denied to the U.S. coalition. Despite its serious weaknesses, the U.N. is more experienced and competent in addressing these challenges and more successful in mobilizing help than we are.</span></p> <p><span>The U.N. has currently undertaken two important assignments: working to put together the form of the Iraqi government to which \u201climited authority\u201d will be passed over on June 30, and preparing for eventual general elections. This posture may signal its preferred stance, that is to accept specific projects within areas of special competence but to avoid taking over the lead role. The U.N. has become reluctant to accept full responsibility for the so-called civilian side, not only because it can read the perilousness of the situation it would now inherit, but because of its well-founded fears of continued manipulation and scapegoating at the hands of the U.S.  We are now again second-guessing U.N. special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi, as well as quarreling among ourselves about whether the U.S. military or the U.S. Embassy should be in charge of reconstruction.</span></p> <p><span>There are reasons why this two-part reshaping of U.S. strategy may not work, but there is no good plan left, and this strategy has the best chance of success. Departing in the midst of widening chaos for which we bear responsibility would be an awful outcome, but that prospect is looming and time is running out. If we continue to stumble along our stubborn path, any exit strategy we could then design would be particularly treacherous. If we seize this last chance and do our best to make it work we might succeed. If we failed, we would then still be better off navigating withdrawal and coping with its aftermath, perhaps with more respect and resiliency to work with both abroad and at home.</span></p> <p><span><i>Jonathan Moore served as U.S. ambassador under Presidents Reagan and George H.W.

{"title": "Beating Bush | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>When the class of 2004 first stepped into Tercentenary Theatre during Freshman Week, Bill Clinton was still in the White House, George W. Bush was just a conservative upstart governor from Texas and Al Gore \u201969 hadn\u2019t yet relegated himself to awkwardly bearded obscurity. What a difference four years makes. Tomorrow, the class of 2004 will leave the New Yard graduates of Harvard College with Bush presiding over a regime marked by landmark environmental deregulation, the frustrating conflict in Iraq and a crushing deficit, just to name a few of his more significant blunders. And he hasn\u2019t even finished his first term.</span></p> <p><span>But this fall, another presidential election will soon give the voters of this country a chance to rid the White House of the Bush clan for a second time. We hope they do.</span></p> <p><span>When the primary season started in New Hampshire this year, The Crimson Staff endorsed distinguished war veteran and Massachusetts Senator John F. Kerry in the year\u2019s first major political contest. We were glad to see that the Democrats picked a leader of such caliber to take on the president and his henchmen in the general election. Despite what misleading Republican attack ads say, Kerry\u2019s record on the war in Iraq, taxes, the environment, social security and health care is much more in line with mainstream America than Bush\u2019s radical right-wing agenda disguised by the unconvincing veneer of \u201ccompassionate conservatism.\u201d Indeed, nearly every poll taken indicates that, especially on domestic concerns, Kerry consistently beats out Bush on almost every issue of major importance to Americans. And Kerry\u2019s already enviable legacy as a public servant\u2014from the time he led Veterans Against the War to his long legislative career in the House and Senate\u2014gives him a lifetime of experience that should set him in sharp relief to his opponent, whose driving ambition before he entered politics was to become baseball commissioner. (He failed.)</span></p> <p><span>Yet a life filled with heroism, principled activism and legislative accomplishment will not be enough to beat Bush in November. Just as the polls indicate that Kerry is better on the issues than Bush, they also show that the two candidates are in a statistical dead heat and that, despite Bush\u2019s falling numbers, Kerry is having trouble picking up the support of those recently disenchanted with the president. Bush\u2019s special brand of down-home charisma and charm must be part of the reason, and it will be difficult for Kerry to battle a gut feeling most Americans have about the president, whom many voters continue to deem decisive and trustworthy. But Bush\u2019s excellent campaign staff\u2014including spin maestro Karl Rove and the likable Texas twang of Karen Hughes\u2014is another big Bush asset. The president\u2019s own Texas-tinted brain trust has already demonstrated its willingness to exploit the tragedy of September 11, 2001 in the campaign\u2019s first round of ads, which prominently feature footage of the World Trade Center\u2019s rubble. Bush may well manage to scare enough Americans into voting for him using these gut-wrenching images.</span></p> <p><span>Even if Bush weren\u2019t as formidable an opponent, Kerry still has to deal with the last election\u2019s spoiler, Ralph Nader. Though Nader has promised to leave the race if it looks like he might swing it for Bush (and polling data indicates that he very well might), his mere entry into the campaign threatens to split the liberal vote. If he really wants to form a united front against the president, Nader should rally behind the one man who has a chance at beating Bush\u2014John Kerry.</span></p> <p><span>Despite all the difficulties, though, we believe that Kerry\u2014who has proven himself an able campaigner, especially late in the race\u2014can and should win in November. Because if Bush\u2019s first term was bad, there\u2019s no telling how ruinous a lame-duck second term could turn out to be.</span></p>"}

Blumenthal decided to take slightly more drastic measures.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI was very concerned in the late \u201850s/early \u201860s, particularly when the Cuban Missile Crisis took place, about our chances of survival,\u201d Blumenfeld says. \u201cThat led me to think that I want to go to a place like New Zealand which I thought might have a good chance of escaping a nuclear attack and nuclear fallout around the world.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In 1962, Blumenfeld embarked to the South Pacific with his then-girlfriend Helaine (now his wife of more than 40 years) and a group of friends. Philia, an international community, was born.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cA lot of people came down,\u201d Blumenfeld recalls. \u201cThere was a large American contingent sent over and a number of British people.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The emigrants settled in the area of Nelson, a town on the northern coast of New Zealand\u2019s south island. Similar communities had already been established near the town, including groups of conscientious objectors who moved to the region before World War I.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt was an experiment,\u201d Blumenfeld says. \u201cWhat we wanted to do was try to show that a community could work on a cooperative basis. Decisions would be on a consensus basis, rather than a voting basis.\u201d He adds, \u201cWe felt that this was the wave of the future.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Cinema fans will note a similarity between the New Zealand settlement and the 1959 anti-war picture \u201cOn the Beach,\u201d about post-nuclear war Australians living out their last months with the specter of radioactive clouds approaching the continent.</span></p> <p><span>While Philia members took jobs in Nelson to help provide funds\u2014\u201cwe had to be very pragmatic,\u201d Blumenfeld says \u2014the community suffered from an occasionally hostile environment.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAt one time I remember there was a book burning session in the town, where they threw A Tree Grows in Brooklyn because they thought it was pornographic,\u201d Blumenfeld says.</span></p> <p><span>The community did not last for long. Fiscal difficulties plagued Philia, and the founder\u2019s attempts to secure financial backing for the venture were less than successful.</span></p> <p><span>Blumenfeld took leave from the South Pacific to visit wealthy friends in Europe, whom he hoped would provide backing. But he said that political difficulties nixed any hopes he had of securing funds.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI was declared persona non grata by the New Zealand government and I couldn\u2019t return,\u201d he explains.</span></p> <p><span>Blumenfeld\u2019s original plan had been to expand the Philia enterprise and purchase property in other South Pacific islands. Despite the failure, he recalls the experiment as being very exciting\u2014\u201cone of the great challenges in my lifetime.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><b>COLLEGE, THEN THE WORLD</b></span></p> <p><span>Born in Amsterdam, Blumenfeld spent his early childhood in France and moved to New York with his family in August 1941. He is the son of Erwin Blumenfeld, an internationally renowned and heavily influential photographer who specialized in fashion imagery, especially female nudes. Major magazines on both sides of the Atlantic used his work for cover photos and spreads, and the younger Blumenfeld recently published a collection of his father\u2019s prints, The Naked and the Veiled: The Photographic Nudes of Erwin Blumenfeld.</span></p> <p><span>Growing up in Manhattan where his father kept a midtown studio, Yorick attended Columbia Grammar School and matriculated to Harvard in 1950.</span></p> <p><span>A French, British, and Russian History and Literature concentrator at the College, Blumenfeld found himself under the tutelage of now-legendary Russian history scholar Richard Pipes. Pipes, the Baird Professor of History Emeritus, guided Blumenfeld through his undergraduate years, an academic journey that culminated in his thesis, \u201cGogol and Russian Censorship.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Blumenfeld argued that censorship acted as a fuel for global creativity, resulting in some of the world\u2019s best-known works of artistry.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe hotly disagreed,\u201d he says of his experience with the noted scholar. \u201cBut it was a very good experience to disagree with Richard Pipes.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>He pauses a moment. \u201cHe did appreciate me, I think,\u201d he says reflectively.</span></p> <p><span>Beyond academics, Blumenfeld was also involved in musical theater at Harvard. He stayed behind the scenes, designing sets for the Lowell House Musical Society and, with a friend, submitting a script for the Hasty Pudding Theatricals.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI liked writing, I didn\u2019t like being on stage,\u201d he recalls.</span></p> <p><span><b>A WORLD OF NEWS</b></span></p> <p><span>The script was not selected for production. But soon after graduation, Blumenfeld began making a career of his writing. After postgraduate work at the London School of Economics, he moved to Washington, D.C. to work as an editorial research reporter at Congressional Quarterly.</span></p> <p><span>In the waning days of 1962, after the Philia experiment had come to a halt, Blumenfeld had a chance meeting with Washington Post owner Philip Graham in Paris. \u201cHe hired me on the spot,\u201d Blumenfeld recalls.</span></p> <p><span>Graham was less than a year away from his suicide.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cPhil was very erratic\u2014a great man but off the wall,\u201d Blumenfeld said. He later became friends with Graham\u2019s wife Katharine, who took over the Post upon her husband\u2019s death and was a formidable force in Washington society until her own death in 2001.</span></p> <p><span>The chance meeting in France was the beginning of a seven-year career at Newsweek. Blumenfeld started as a cultural correspondent based in Paris, and later became the Eastern European Bureau Chief. His work included two major cover stories: profiles of dictators Nicolae Ceausescu of Romania and Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia. Blumenfeld later wrote a book on his experiences, See Saw: Cultural Life in Eastern Europe.</span></p> <p><span>The 1980s brought Ronald Reagan, and a shift in Blumenfeld\u2019s career.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI thought we were heading to another nuclear holocaust,\u201d Blumenfeld says. \u201cThere were so many warheads, mathematically it looked like sooner or later some mishap would happen and we were all going to do ourselves in.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Ironically, Richard Pipes, Blumenfeld\u2019s Harvard thesis adviser, was a key adviser to Reagan\u2019s foreign policy at the time.</span></p> <p><span>Save for several New York Times op-eds on the subject, Blumenfeld shifted his focus to books, calling periodicals \u201ctoo ephemeral.\u201d In 1981, Blumenfeld wrote Jenny: My Diary, a cautionary tale of the consequences of nuclear holocaust.</span></p> <p><span>Today, Blumenthal is the editor of \u201cProspects of Tomorrow,\u201d a series of books focusing on ideas for how to affect the future and discussions of what kinds of issues the world will face in the coming years. The series includes his own 2099: A Eutopia\u2014a look at how daily life may work in a metropolis at the cusp of the 22nd century\u2014and collections of noted scholars discussing positive methods of approaching the future and how to ensure the best possible world for later generations.</span></p> <p><span><b>ACROSS THE POND</b></span></p> <p><span>Today, Blumenfeld and his wife reside in Cambridge, England.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIn 1969, Nixon was going to come into the White House and I had decided I didn\u2019t want to bring my children up into a rather violent and very unpredictable America,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt that it would be better to move to England where we would be in the company of more civilized people.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>However, he has not eschewed the States. He fondly remembers his New York days and visits four to five times a year. \u201cI still get an enormous energy from visiting New York,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>Blumenfeld\u2019s Reagan-era anxiety has not been alleviated much today.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI deplore the way things have deteriorated with the [Bush] administration,\u201d he says. \u201cI am very much opposed to the war in Iraq. I am opposed to the war on terrorism. \u2026 You can\u2019t win a so-called war on terrorism anymore than you can win a war against drugs.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In terms of improving the world, Blumenfeld still considers the pen mightier than the sword, having editorialized on Bush\u2019s policies in The Times of London, The Guardian, and elsewhere. He has also participated in anti-war marches in England, his first experiences as an active demonstrator.</span></p> <p><span>Despite his pessimism about current events, Blumenfeld is still looking to leave the world a better place than he found it, a progressive impulse that remains from his earlier Philia days.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI\u2019m looking at the prospect for a better world and trying to give the younger generation a reason to vote. And give the generation a more positive outlook,\u201d Blumenfeld says. \u201c[I] feel that negativity leads to shock and fright and is one way to get a reaction from people and does not leave them with anything.\u2026I think the positive message is one that they can go back to\u2026.We have a lot to change and I think people really need to be encouraged.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff writer Michael M.

{"title": "Advanced Standing Option Debuts | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>After graduating from the Groton School in 1954, Henry R. Breck \u201958 spent the next year traveling in Europe and \u201cdoing all the things young guys do\u201d before he applied to college.</span></p> <p><span>Wanting to graduate with his peers in 1958, Breck wrote to Harvard and to Yale asking if he could get a year\u2019s credit for his studies of French and German languages and history.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cYale said that, \u2018we think the process of emotional maturity is furthered by a full four years,\u2019\u201d Breck recalls.</span></p> <p><span>But luckily for Breck, Harvard's Faculty of Arts and Sciences had just approved a Program of Special Standing, giving qualified students the option to skip freshman year and enroll in the College as sophomores. Breck was chosen to be the first guinea pig.</span></p> <p><span>The sophomore standing option was one of four new programs created by the Faculty in spring 1954 to give students more flexibility with their undergraduate requirements\u2014a theme echoed in today\u2019s ongoing curricular review \u2014and enable them to speed up their education by one year.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard\u2019s proposals for allowing students to expedite their education came on the heels of the Blackmer Report, issued by the \u201cBig Three\u201d universities and prep schools\u2014Harvard, Yale, and Princeton, along with Exeter, Andover and Lawrenceville.</span></p> <p><span>The Blackmer Committee was created in fall 1951 in response to increased demands for the United States to support education of its best students.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard\u2019s core curriculum at the time was designed based on the report on \u201cGeneral Education for a Free Society\u201d and intended to teach young Americans the principles they would need to protect freedom in the U.S. and across the world, and the Blackmer Committee was a natural outgrowth.</span></p> <p><span>With the Cold War well underway by 1951, the schools wanted to ensure that America\u2019s best and brightest were educated as well and as efficiently as possible to help fight communism\u2014and students, knowing that they would have to serve in the military after graduation, wanted to begin their careers as soon as possible.</span></p> <p><span>In the Committee on Educational Policy (CEP) meeting on Jan. 7, 1953, a divide emerged between those concerned with \u201cthe wastage of time on the part of men who are both unusually able and unusually well-prepared\u201d and those who believed strongly in a traditional four-year undergraduate education.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cLiberal education should not be viewed as a prison term with one-fourth off for good behavior,\u201d Professor of England J. Douglas Bush told The Crimson in February 1954. \u201cI\u2019m aware of the pressures of time and money, but these should not be the real consideration.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Eliot House Master John H. Finley \u201925 also voiced his opposition to the CEP at its Jan. 7, 1953 meeting, arguing that gifted students could be given more flexibility within a four-year program by being placed in advanced courses from their first year, but without heading towards what he feared would become a credit-hour system of education.</span></p> <p><span>The CEP eventually settled on three ways for students to slice a year off of their education: skipping twelfth grade and entering Harvard a year early; replacing the freshman year of college with three full credits (either from advanced high school classes or other college coursework); and condensing undergraduate and graduate education to seven years. These proposals, along with a proposal to grant students placement into higher-level courses, were presented to the Faculty the next spring.</span></p> <p><span>But as with the creation of General Education in 1949, Harvard\u2019s establishment of advanced standing was intended to modify Harvard undergraduate education and thereby shape American high school education.</span></p> <p><span>At the conclusion of the CEP meeting, then-Dean of Admissions Wilbur J. Bender \u201927 emphasized not the financial savings or increased educational opportunities, but that the Blackmer Report entrusted the big three universities to take steps to implement it and revise the U.S. educational system. If universities failed to grant credit for high school courses, professors were concerned, high schools would stop offering advanced classes.</span></p> <p><span>CEP granted the Blackmer Report its final approval in February 1954, with Bush alone dissenting\u2014and only on the proposal to allow students to graduate in three years.</span></p> <p><span>With no organized opposition emerging at the Faculty meeting of March 2, 1954, Harvard became the first school to endorse the Blackmer Report, approving the CEP report and creating a Committee on Special Standing. Harlan P. Hanson \u201948, then-assistant senior tutor of Kirkland House, was put in charge of its implementation.</span></p> <p><span>Though the Faculty passed regulations and created a new program, the implementation of advanced standing was somewhat haphazard at the beginning.</span></p> <p><span>Breck says that he was granted credit in German after approaching Hanson in fall 1955 and discussing a German newspaper with him for about five minutes.  Having spent a year across the ocean, Breck says, \u201cI spoke much better German than he did.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>After passing his French language and literature tests, and being granted German credits from Hansen, Breck says that he approached the English Department and asked for an English credit.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThey said, \u2018If you got a French and a German, you probably deserve an English,\u2019\u201d Breck recalls.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHarvard did something smart,\u201d he says. \u201cThey took a very young and probably very immature, bright young kid and they said, \u2018We\u2019ll do whatever you want.\u2019\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Breck lived in Lionel Hall for his first semester and then moved to Lowell House for his final two and a half years.</span></p> <p><span>Philip E. Burnham \u201960, like Breck, spent a year abroad before coming to Harvard\u2014though he spent it taking courses at the University of Edinburgh. Burnham came to Harvard in the fall of 1957, but spent much less time in the Yard before moving to Winthrop House.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI spent three days in Mass. Hall above the president\u2019s office as a freshman, and then I was subsequently and swiftly transferred to sophomore status,\u201d Burnham says.</span></p> <p><span>Though advanced standing students now remain in the Yard during their freshman year, the program as a whole has changed little since 1954. Advanced students can still graduate a year early or choose to remain for a fourth year and earn a master\u2019s degree, though most now choose the latter option.</span></p> <p><span>Looking back, some of the early participants regret having graduated early, instead of staying for a fourth year.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI don\u2019t know in retrospect if that\u2019s a terrific idea,\u201d says George M. Whitesides \u201960 about his three-year College education. \u201cAll the things that would be wonderful to have done in that last year, I didn\u2019t do them....It\u2019s nice at the time because it makes you feel special, but what comes of the flexibility is what you make it.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff writer Joshua D.

{"title": "Ivy Considers Leaving NCAA | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Before the Super Bowl, there was the Yale Bowl. Before Chicago\u2019s Soldier Field, there was Cambridge\u2019s Soldiers\u2019 Field. Before the Bowl Championship Series, there was The Game.</span></p> <p><span>And before there were college athletics, there was college sport.</span></p> <p><span>But as commercial television and intercollegiate football intersected in the immediate aftermath of World War II, the distinction between the two rapidly blurred, resulting in a fissure in the membership of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) which left the loosely-affiliated Ivy Group on the brink of withdrawing from the national body in favor of a small, self-contained conference.</span></p> <p><span>Initially, the internal debate\u2019s dominant voice came from those college administrators nationwide who decried the drop off in attendance that accompanied the nationwide airing of premier match ups each Saturday.</span></p> <p><span>In response, the NCAA formed a 10-member committee to govern coast-to-coast coverage in 1952, which first responded to member schools\u2019 complaints by implementing a game of the week policy which banned all other contests from the airwaves. Schools were limited to one appearance per year, but might be kept off the air altogether at the NCAA\u2019s discretion, as Harvard was in 1952 when the DuMont network\u2019s efforts to air The Game in New York were rejected by the NCAA, since NBC had placed the winning bid for the year\u2019s exclusive broadcast rights.</span></p> <p><span>But this accomplished little in the way of solving the problem. While the exodus from the stadiums to the couches was slowed by the restriction, attendance remained markedly down, even with just one game on television. The dissatisfaction of excluded programs\u2014most vocally expressed by Pennsylvania Athletic Director Francis Murray, who insisted that the limitations be scrapped\u2014mitigated those marginal gains, however.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe present program has proved a complete failure and, in addition, clearly violates existing anti-trust laws.\u201d Murray told The Crimson in 1952. \u201cI am highly optimistic that it will be thrown out and a new plan substituted.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Though Murray proposed a three-point revenue-sharing plan of his own to counter the extension of the television monopoly, he quickly fell under attack for his public criticisms of the NCAA policies, even within the Ivy Group, foreshadowing greater conflict to come.</span></p> <p><span>When Yale Athletic Director Robert Hall, the architect of the NCAA plan and Murray\u2019s primary adversary stepped down on May 13, 1953, the Ancient Eight\u2019s relationship with the NCAA rapidly unraveled. Harvard rejected the NCAA television framework two days later and Yale withdrew on May 25.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThomas D. Bolles, Director of Athletics, announced last night that Provost Paul H. Buck with the approval of the Harvard Corporation voted against the National Collegiate Association\u2019s football television policy for the 1953 season,\u201d the College\u2019s press release said. \u201cHarvard intends not to be bound by any program restricting its right to decide independently when and to what extent it will televise athletic sports.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Though both Harvard and Yale made no overtures to independently arrange a network broadcast arrangement, Pennsylvania almost immediately entered into such negotiations, while Princeton privately voted against the NCAA\u2019s national blackout.</span></p> <p><span>The coordinated moves prompted speculation that the Ivy schools might withdraw from the national body altogether despite denials from the colleges.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe decided not to go along with the NCAA plan because we felt we should be responsible only to ourselves for our own decisions,\u201d said Charles M. O\u2019Hearn, assistant to Yale President A. Whitney Griswold. \u201cWe are acting independently on this issue and will do so on all policy issues.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe still consider ourselves members in good standing, and are only acting independently on this issue,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Officially, talk centered on the legality of the NCAA\u2019s measures. The National Football League had pursued a comparable slate for its televised games, only to find itself the subject of a Justice Department anti-trust probe. Similar questions surrounded the NCAA\u2019s monopoly status, and it was those concerns which were cited as the principle underlying the Ivies rejection of the television deal.</span></p> <p><span>But internally at least, discussion of the NCAA\u2019s inability to adequately resolve the simplest problems and talk of secession reached the highest administrative levels at each of the colleges, spurring a series of mutual reforms that bound their athletic programs together.</span></p> <p><span>Whereas pressure from member schools had previously brought Murray in line when he spoke out against the television grid plan\u2014some traditional opponents had gone so far as to drop the Quakers from their schedule\u2014on Oct. 28, 1953 the eight schools agreed to strengthen their intra-conference calendars, implementing a round-robin schedule that guaranteed seven league games per season by 1956.</span></p> <p><span>The move was widely perceived as indicating the group\u2019s intent to create a cohesive unit strong enough to weather an NCAA boycott upon a break of any sort with the governing body, despite the pledge of the organization\u2019s Eastern director not to bring any pressure and to allow Ivy programs to continue to compete against member schools.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any possibility of that coming\u2014the Ivy colleges are active and interested members of the NCAA,\u201d Asa Bushnell said. \u201cI don\u2019t think [the discontent expressed by both Harvard and Yale is] the feeling of even a sizable part. I think most of them are quite willing to go along with the NCAA on policy matters and let the Association make the policy decisions.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cA break would be a blow to the NCAA, but I think it would be a far worse blow to the Ivy colleges themselves,\u201d Bushnell added.</span></p> <p><span>Still, the solidification campaign steadily advanced on Feb. 10, as the presidents from the informal Ivy Group reaffirmed their commitments to maintaining the purity of amateur athletics, breaking with the NCAA by banning both scholarships and spring football practice, while eliminating participation in bowl and all-star games. The Group additionally extended the round-robin scheduling format to all sports in which it was feasible, formally establishing what is now held to be the Ivy League.</span></p> <p><span>In early April, 1954, in an attempt to appease the disenchanted union, the NCAA privately offered Harvard and Yale broadcast rights for their fall contest, hoping that President Nathan M. Pusey \u201928 would be more amenable to strike a deal than his predecessor\u2019s administration, particularly after Athletic Director Thomas D. Bolles expressed interest in revisiting the College\u2019s position.</span></p> <p><span>Though both sides publicly denied that such an offer had been made, the contract would have tentatively netted Harvard $30,000. But Pusey remained steadfast, rejecting the offer with Yale not far behind.</span></p> <p><span>With the Ivy League and the Big 10 agitating for reform in the NCAA\u2019s television policies, the move was widely perceived as a means to buy off the organization\u2019s two most vocal opponents. But lingering resentment over the illegal monopoly and dissatisfaction with the commercialization of the college game due to its widespread appeal was reported to have guided the decision to remain committed to the previous non-compliance policy, while maintaining suspicion that a schism was in the works.</span></p> <p><span>But as the months passed, the tension slowly dropped off as the Ivy Group failed to extricate itself from the Eastern Collegiate Athletic Conference (ECAC), strongly in favor of the NCAA\u2019s blackout plan, by continuing to use the league\u2019s officials and remaining within the league\u2019s governing infrastructure.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe Ivy Group is just not ready to break away and become independent,\u201d said Donald M. Felt, Assistant Director of Athletics in anticipation of the meting.</span></p> <p><span>But the mounting pressure that the Big 10 and Pacific Coast Conference applied to the NCAA proved sufficient to maintain the national body\u2019s unity.</span></p> <p><span>Threatening to break away from the ECAC as a result of what the Big 10 labeled \u201cunacceptable\u201d television policies, the two western conferences countered with a less stringent regional broadcast policy\u2014with eight weekends devoted to national coverage, five to regional action\u2014that freed schools to air games in high demand on a local level without violating NCAA regulations.</span></p> <p><span>The plan passed an NCAA vote 193-27, with Harvard voting against, though its objections to the plan were notably softened with the College leaving open the possibility of broadcasting regionally without assenting to the entire policy.</span></p> <p><span>The Game was not televised in 1955, superseded by the annual match up between UCLA and USC.</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff writer Timothy J.

{"title": "The Mess in Iraq | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Another year has passed and the war in Iraq carries on, but discontent\u2014in Iraq, across America and throughout the world\u2014has grown stronger. Repeated errors in intelligence, appalling security failures for the Iraqi people, startling revelations of corruption and cronyism in the rebuilding efforts, photographs of egregious abuses of Iraqi prisoners\u2014all of these events over the past year have shocked the world. At the end of this month, the recently appointed Iraqi administration will take over \u201cfull sovereignty\u201d of Iraq\u2014at least in name. It is hopeful, although highly doubtful, that this changeover will mark the beginning of the end of the Bush administration\u2019s tragic foreign policy miscalculations in Iraq. The Iraqi people, the American people and indeed people worldwide, deserve better.</span></p> <p><span>Although our concerns about Bush\u2019s commitment to nation-building in Iraq date back months prior to the war, we have been stunned at the president\u2019s stumbles over the past year. The pace of recovery was expected to be slow, but over the past year we felt as though the American effort was running in place\u2014if not taking steps backward in the war on terror. As we feared prior to the war, America\u2019s invasion has heightened anger toward the United States and turned Iraq into a rallying point for terrorist recruitment. America seems poised to hand the world another failed state mired in internal strife\u2014a breeding ground for the terrorists the United States is ostensibly fighting. The world has become less safe\u2014not safer\u2014since the United States invaded Iraq.</span></p> <p><span>This September saw the White House\u2019s first half-hearted attempt to swallow its pride and ask the international community for help. After circumventing the United Nations Security Council and ignoring weapons inspectors in the run-up to war\u2014and refusing for nearly five months after the invasion to consult with the General Assembly\u2014Bush returned to the U.N. to rally support. We were pleased that the president recognized\u2014implicitly, if not openly\u2014the errors of his unilateral approach and the need for assistance from an institution he once wrote off as \u201cirrelevant.\u201d But emblematic of the Bush administration\u2019s general policy toward the international community, the president arrived late, missing a speech from U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan and came up short in his own address. Rather than showing humility, Bush delivered an aloof and defensive speech. He stubbornly stuck by his dismissive stance, opposing a meaningful role for the U.N. in Iraqi reconstruction. The president asked the international community to \u201ccontribute greatly,\u201d calling on the U.N. to \u201cassist\u201d the United States in drawing up an Iraqi constitution, training civil servants and overseeing elections. But he pointedly\u2014and unwisely\u2014refused to relinquish U.S. control of Iraq and make way for U.N. control of the reconstruction, stabilization and democratization of the country.</span></p> <p><span>At the time, Bush\u2019s tone was frustrating; today, after nine more months of violence, his September speech is upsetting. We have since witnessed the destructive failure of his arrogant go-it-alone approach. To be sure, at critical junctures in the past year and increasingly over the past several months, Bush has turned to the U.N. for assistance, relying on Annan to lend legitimacy to the coalition-imposed election timetable, asking the U.N. to play a role in the selection of Iraq\u2019s next slate of leaders. But the president\u2019s chronic inability to admit mistakes and his extreme arrogance have made a difficult reconstruction effort all the more trying.</span></p> <p><span>We are also concerned with Bush\u2019s determination to proclaim democracy established as soon as possible\u2014before Iraq is adequately prepared for it. After prematurely declaring \u201cmission accomplished\u201d a year and several months ago, Bush has set a firm date for the transfer of power to local authorities\u2014June 30, just weeks from today. Mired in the paranoia of an election year, this deadline ensures ample time to dissociate his presidency from the ongoing violence and volatile events on the ground. The president will be able to blame the mess\u2014the suicide bombings, random violence, rampant unemployment and poor social services that plague the country\u2014on the Iraqi administrators nominally in charge, rather than take responsibility for his unimpressive reconstruction policy.</span></p> <p><span>But as politically convenient a June power transfer might be for the president, we hope that domestic political calculations will not keep him from doing what\u2019s right in Iraq. We fear that as June 30 approaches, given the chaos on the Iraqi street and the perceived illegitimacy of the Iraqi leadership, an effective handover of authority\u2014that isn\u2019t dismissed as a farce\u2014will be impossible. We hope for the best outcome, but fear that this administration, which has never had a genuine reconstruction plan, is playing politics with people\u2019s lives.</span></p> <p><span>At a press conference last month\u2014only the third prime-time press conference of Bush\u2019s presidency\u2014the president tried hard to deflect blame for everything from the Sept. 11 attacks to Iraq\u2019s missing weapons of mass destruction. But by refusing to accept the slightest blame, or answer the most straightforward questions about his actions, Bush continues to undermine progress abroad. The Iraqi people, the international community and increasing numbers of American citizens are learning to distrust and dismiss statements from this White House, and in the global war on terror, such lack of credibility and worldwide cooperation will be disastrous.</span></p> <p><span>In recent Memorial Day speeches, President Bush attempted to equate the war in Iraq with America\u2019s honorable efforts in World War II. But in today\u2019s war, U.S. troops are largely viewed as occupiers\u2014not liberators. It is true that removing Saddam Hussein provides the potential for great improvements and new freedoms, but this divisive war is far from righteous. America has replaced tyranny with chaos, and it is the responsibility of the U.S.-led coalition to ensure lasting stability wins out in the end. That might mean that Bush has to eat his pride and humbly approach the international community or that American troops and administrators will have to remain in harm\u2019s way longer than what would be politically convenient for the president. But it\u2019s time for Bush to start doing what\u2019s right instead of continuing to live in a neoconservative pipedream.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Students Hit the Road on \u201904 Campaign Trail  | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Political campaigns attract a strange cast of characters\u2014a m\u00e9lange of college students, the unemployed and trust fund babies. Some are locals who only stick around for a few days; others are peripatetics who roam from one end of the country to the other, groupies who follow candidates from one swing state to the next.</span></p> <p><span>Harvardians readily threw themselves into this mix this school year, suffering the stress, pressures and sacrifices of a grassroots operation while still juggling classes, exams and additional extracurriculars.</span></p> <p><span>Students traveled across the country to volunteer for their favored candidates, in trips ranging from bus rides to New Hampshire to flights to South Carolina.</span></p> <p><span>And with national elections heading into full swing in the fall, all campus political organizations are expecting an active next few months in the chaos of the campaign.</span></p> <p><span><b>ON THE ROAD</b></span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt was one of the greatest learning experiences I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d Eric P. Lesser \u201907 said of his work for Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., in Charleston, S.C. last January.</span></p> <p><span>Lesser, a member of the Harvard College Democrats, flew to the Palmetto State with 21 other students to help campaign in the South Carolina presidential primary.</span></p> <p><span>Jessica R. Rosenfeld \u201907, who worked in the Londonberry, N.H. campaign office of Sen. John Edwards, D-N.C., laughed at the memory of her experiences.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI came back [to campus] once for my Justice final,\u201d she said. Rosenfeld, internships director for the College Dems, spent almost the entirety of fall reading period working in the Granite State, living in volunteers\u2019 basements and subsisting on the coffee-and-snacks campaign diet for nearly three weeks.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt was freezing,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were some points where it was 30 below...at one point I was sitting on an overpass over I-93 and I physically got sick. We had volunteers with frostbite, it was just ridiculous. You knew you had to do it, it was just the weather was not cooperating.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Rosenfeld appreciated the camaraderie that came with the campaign climate, however.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cEveryone there for the most part was between the ages of 18 and 30,\u201d she said. \u201cYou get to be really close friends in a very short time with people.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Although Edwards emerged from New Hampshire with a defeat, Rosenfeld followed Edwards to his more successful run in South Carolina, where she helped coordinate volunteer activities at the Charleston field office. Three weeks later, she joined the New York offices of the campaign, acting as field director for Long Island.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI definitely missed a lot of class,\u201d Rosenfeld said. \u201cThankfully my grades, I don\u2019t think have suffered. I definitely worked very hard before I left to get ahead and worked very hard when I got back to catch up.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In Charleston, the Harvard contingent split into four groups, each volunteering for a specific candidate. Students were out in support of Kerry, Edwards, Gov. Howard Dean, D-Vt., and Gen. Wesley Clark.</span></p> <p><span>While intraparty tensions ran high among the Dems when the primary was involved, they put aside their differences after hours, when debates finished and television pundits mouthed superficial insight and insubstantial chatter into the night. As Kerry fans and Deaniacs came together to share a pitcher of beer, cameras preserved the memories of fun times on the campaign trail.</span></p> <p><span>Lesser, who worked for Dean\u2019s campaign in New Hampshire but switched to Kerry in South Carolina, found his Charleston experience an eye-opening one.</span></p> <p><span>\u201c[We] really became immersed in the culture of the campaign. You learned what the concerns and needs of people in that area were,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a tremendous chance to see the differences in American political culture but also see the similarities. Everyone wanted a better economy, everyone wants government to be effective.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>A visit to a poor African American neighborhood in Charleston brought out strong emotions in Kerry volunteer Jonathan D. Einkauf \u201906. Einkauf, who said his family \u201cjust scraped by\u201d at one point in their lives, said he was frustrated that other campaigns were ignoring poorer communities.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI feel that no one else treats [these people] with respect and I feel that we are,\u201d he said while walking through the area, on the outskirts of metropolitan Charleston.</span></p> <p><span><b>SOFT MONEY</b></span></p> <p><span>The Dems were not alone in their off-campus junkets. The Harvard Republican Club (HRC) also sponsored a campaign trip to Rhode Island in December. With a heated primary race affecting the party, however, the Democrats were much more active in campaigning this year.</span></p> <p><span>This disparity actually led to conflict between the HRC and the Institute of Politics (IOP).</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt was frustrating to hear the IOP talk about parity during a semester in which its resources were focused so exclusively on the Democratic primary,\u201d HRC President Mark T. Silvestri \u201905 said in February.</span></p> <p><span>Silvestri and other club members said they were concerned that while the Dems had received $2,500 from the IOP for the Charleston trip, the HRC had received hardly any IOP funds for their own campaign activities.</span></p> <p><span>The IOP defended the disparities in funding as a \u201cfunction of the campaign cycle,\u201d according to Ilan T. Graff \u201905, president of the IOP Student Affairs Committee.</span></p> <p><span>The HRC had previously filed a request for an IOP grant to fund its 115th anniversary dinner last fall at the Faculty Club. The original application asked for $1,500, but the IOP only provided $500 to the club. Per IOP regulations, the HRC was then barred from applying for a second grant for the remainder of the year.</span></p> <p><span>Despite his frustrations, Silvestri said in January he was hopeful that the IOP would provide funds to bankroll later trips taken by the HRC, perhaps on the same scale as the Dems\u2019 South Carolina sojourn.</span></p> <p><span><b>DON\u2019T STOP THINKING ABOUT TOMORROW</b></span></p> <p><span>At the close of the primary season, the Dems shifted gears, mobilizing behind the primary victor and apparent Democratic presidential contender Kerry.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe work closely with the Kerry campaign and try to do whatever we can for them,\u201d Dems President Andrew J. Frank \u201905 said. \u201cUnfortunately we didn\u2019t work as much as we wanted to. It\u2019s a lot to shift from a primary campaign in the states to a national campaign.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Frank cited disorganization on the part of the Kerry campaign as a reason for a post-primary slow start.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt took awhile for [the Kerry campaign] to get everything set up,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have field offices, they had to hire a lot more staff.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Nevertheless, the Dems tried to form an active presence on campus during the spring semester. A \u201cBeat Bush\u201d rally, organized by the Dems, the Bisexual, Gay, Lesbian, Transgender and Supporters Alliance, Harvard Socialist Alternative and other campus groups, was held outside the Science Center in mid-May.</span></p> <p><span>And Frank said that compared to other schools, Harvard Dems were ahead of the game.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe\u2019ve done a lot for this stage in the campaign,\u201d Frank said. \u201cIn most colleges the campus is pretty dead until the fall before the election.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Frank said he is proud of the Dems\u2019 fundraising efforts, which he said have brought in between $700 and $1,000 for the Kerry campaign.</span></p> <p><span>Every weekend in the fall, the Dems plan to send volunteers to New Hampshire, the nearest swing state. Frank said the group is also planning a campaigning trip outside of New England. On campus, Dems will set up phonebanking hubs in dorms and House junior common rooms.</span></p> <p><span>On the GOP side, Silvestri confirmed last week that the HRC will ask the IOP for funding in the fall.</span></p> <p><span>Josh M. Mendelsohn \u201905, former president of the HRC and chair of Harvard Students for Bush, said the HRC will be looking to dispatch student Bush supporters off campus to help support the president.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMassachusetts is obviously a very dynamic state but unfortunately is very liberal and is very loyally Democratic,\u201d said Mendelsohn, who is also chair of Massachusetts Students for Bush. \u201cAs a result, we are focusing our efforts on exporting the time, talent and energy of our volunteers.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe\u2019re going to go to New Hampshire where the president had a very narrow [victory] margin there and we want to maintain that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are going to make ourselves available to some of the key swing states across the country, whether that be Ohio, Michigan or Florida.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Mendelsohn also said the club will participate in an absentee ballot initiative on campus.</span></p> <p><span>He noted that while no plans have been confirmed, there will \u201cdefinitely be out-of-state trips.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Stephanie N. Kendall \u201905, membership director of the HRC, is already on the ground for her candidate. Kendall is currently in Tallahassee working at the central Florida office of the Bush-Cheney reelect campaign.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s an adventure everyday,\u201d said Kendall, who is also communications director for Massachusetts Students for Bush. Kendall is in charge of handling campus press queries in Massachusetts, and is performing odd jobs around the Tallahassee office.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cStudents have a lot of energy and in the summer they have a lot of time and they\u2019re eager,\u201d Kendall said. \u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic opportunity to gain a lot of experience themselves and also it\u2019s a fantastic position for the campaign to get a lot of people willing and able to work long hours.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff writer Michael M.

{"title": "New Programs Reflect Emphasis on Science | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>University President Lawrence H. Summers forged ahead this year in his efforts to bolster science at Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>He recommended that the University create a third science campus, while he oversaw the creation of a half-dozen new science initiatives and embraced sweeping proposals to reinvigorate undergraduate science education.</span></p> <p><span>The Allston science and technology task force, whose report was released last month, urged the University to invest significantly in expanding engineering, applied science and emerging areas like stem cell research as part of Harvard\u2019s campus of the future south of the Charles River. The one-million-square-foot science hub that will serve as the campus\u2019 academic heart will feature cutting-edge laboratories intended to encourage cross-disciplinary research.</span></p> <p><span>Last June, the University entered into a historic partnership with MIT and the Cambridge-based Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research to create the $300-million Broad Institute, charged with finding clinical applications for the recently mapped human genome.</span></p> <p><span>A spate of other ambitious initiatives were rolled out this year, including the Harvard Stem Cell Institute. And more\u2014mostly intended for the Allston campus\u2014remain in the works.</span></p> <p><span>The College\u2019s curricular review report, released in May, encourages more emphasis on the sciences, including offering more comprehensive survey courses for non-concentrators and a renewed emphasis on hands-on research.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe present report suggests that we enhance significantly the opportunities for our students in international studies and in the sciences, two areas in which our world has arguably changed most dramatically since our last general review,\u201d Dean of the Faculty William C. Kirby wrote in a letter introducing the report.</span></p> <p><span>And to fund much of this science expansion, the University plans to begin a sweeping capital campaign\u2014with a likely goal of over $4 billion, the largest in higher education history, and with a primary goal of expanding the sciences.</span></p> <p><span>Summers insisted in September that Harvard take advantage of emerging fields in science.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe must not miss the tremendous opportunity that is inherent in this moment\u2014excellence has its cost,\u201d Summers said. He added that the University must ensure \u201cthat the limits of what we can accomplish are the limits on the imaginations of our scientists.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Professors say the new initiatives, in addition to at least 15 new science faculty appointments, are likely to reshape the curriculum and make steps toward a resurgence in Harvard\u2019s sciences.</span></p> <p><span><b>BRANCHING OUT</b></span></p> <p><span>Since the end of the last academic year, Summers has unveiled a plethora of new University-wide science initiatives.</span></p> <p><span>The Broad Institute, which officially began operating last month, will work to bring together math and biology to apply the genome to clinical ends.</span></p> <p><span>Its formation marks a major step in implementing so-called \u201cbig science\u201d at Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>\u201c[There is] also a sociological goal\u2014which is to allow larger collaborative efforts in both teaching hospitals, Harvard and MIT, to bring people together to take on challenges that can\u2019t be taken on by individuals,\u201d said Broad Director Eric S. Lander.</span></p> <p><span>Lander said the institute will also have an impact on undergraduate education by increasing research opportunities and eventually by offering seminars and workshops through its faculty.</span></p> <p><span>And the Broad Institute was just the beginning of the University\u2019s scientific expansion.</span></p> <p><span>In February, The Boston Globe reported the formation of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute, which was not officially launched or announced until April.</span></p> <p><span>The center was formed partially in response to the Bush administration\u2019s more restrictive policy on federal funding for stem cell research, in the hopes that Harvard could solicit private support instead.</span></p> <p><span>News of the new institute came not long after Harvard took a hit in February, when two South Korean researchers announced that they had taken therapeutic cloning to a whole new level by extracting a line of stem cells from a cloned human embryo.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis is a field which was started in the U.S., and we are currently in the position of falling behind amongst international competitors,\u201d said David T. Scadden, director of Massachusetts General Hospital\u2019s Center for Regenerative Medicine and Technology and co-director of the institute. \u201cPartly what has driven the U.S. research machine is U.S. government funding. Because scientists\u2019 engagement in [stem cell research] is highly restricted, there has been a chill in this field, and we hope this effort will partly compensate for that by providing monetary resources for scientists.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The Stem Cell Institute intends to unite a wide range of professional fields within the University, such as lab science, business and medicine, to develop ethically responsible stem cell therapies with a focus on degenerative diseases.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe think that Harvard can offer particularly unique contributions to this field both because of its depth and...extraordinary people,\u201d Scadden said. \u201cBecause this spans a wide range of disciplines, this can create new types of courses and also engage students in independent research projects.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In September, Harvard\u2019s Bauer Center for Genomics Research (CGR) received a five-year, $15 million grant from the National Institutes of Health endowing a Center of Excellence in Complex Biomedical Systems Research, aiming to investigate organisms\u2019 molecular structure.</span></p> <p><span>CGR Director and Professor of Molecular and Cellular Biology Andrew W. Murray said the money will help fund the study of \u201cmodular design\u201d in various lifeforms.</span></p> <p><span>The center is unique in seeking to combine biological theory with empirical results, Murray said.</span></p> <p><span>The University\u2019s commitment to biological research was reinforced two weeks later, as Harvard Medical School (HMS) unveiled the $260-million New Research Building. The massive new research facility stands as the University\u2019s largest structure ever\u2014spanning over half a million square feet.</span></p> <p><span>Associate Dean for Public Affairs Donald L. Gibbons said that the building will \u201cwork to foster a closer relationship between basic science research and translational research occurring at hospitals,\u201d thereby speeding the creation of clinical applications for lab discoveries.</span></p> <p><span>In October, Summers announced an interdisciplinary Center for Systems Neuroscience, another burgeoning initiative which will integrate the study of neurons, nervous systems and cognition with other fields such as psychology, biology, physics and engineering.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe center will have a big role to play in changing the curriculum,\u201d said Tarr Professor of Molecular and Cellular Biology Markus Meister. \u201cYou can imagine that with 10 additional faculty to teach neuroscience, the curriculum will look very different from the way it looks now.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Alumni Endowed Professor of Anatomy and Neurobiology Joshua R. Sanes at the Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine, who will become director of the Center for Systems Neuroscience in July, said the new focus on neuroscience will provide a healthy balance to the current broad study track of Mind, Brain and Behavior (MBB) at Harvard, which incorporates such fields as linguistics, psychology and sociology in studying the brain.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere is a tremendous amount of interest in neuroscience. The MBB program is quite broad, and neurosciences is only one of its components,\u201d said Sanes, as he explained that neuroscience is a way of studying the brain that\u2019s based purely in biology. \u201cSo I think there is a huge need for education opportunities in neuroscience for undergraduates, both in terms of course work, seminars and lab opportunities.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Sanes said one of the key aspects of the neuroscience center will be to attempt to combine studies of neuroscience and behavior and that new courses designed in the field of neurobiology will reflect this focus.</span></p> <p><span>In addition, Sanes said the neuroscience program in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS) will work closely with HMS and other graduate programs.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cLarry Summers is quite interested in having the university together, and FAS and HMS have not worked together well in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are in the vanguard of increasing interactions between FAS and the med school.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>This February, in a significant boost to an existing initiative, the School of Public Health was granted $107 million over the next five years from President Bush\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief to fight HIV/AIDS in Africa.

{"title": "Bill Clinton, Porter Trade Sharper Jabs Over Memoir | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Timothy J. Mcginn", "body": "<p><span>Hours after his address to the Democratic National Convention, Bill Clinton was back on the offensive, flatly dismissing allegations that his recently published autobiography included a fabricated account of a conversation  with Kennedy School of Government professor Roger B. Porter.</span></p> <p><span>In an exclusive interview in Cambridge early this morning, Clinton told The Crimson that Porter\u2019s claims about the book, <i>My Life</i>, were simply \u201cnot true.\u201d But, despite the hour, Porter wasted little time answering right back, sharpening his criticisms of Clinton\u2019s account and expanding their scope.</span></p> <p><span>Clinton had written in his memoir that Porter, who was Economic and Domestic Policy Adviser under President George H. W. Bush, had fired a warning shot at him.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHere\u2019s how Washington works,\u201d Clinton quoted Porter as saying in <i>My Life</i>. \u201cThe press has to have somebody and we\u2019re going to give them you...We\u2019ll spend whatever we have to spend to get whoever we have to get to say whatever they have to say to take you out. And we\u2019ll do it early.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In June, after the autobiography was released, Porter said Clinton\u2019s account was untrue, a charge the former president rebutted this morning.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cYou don\u2019t forget something like that,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cJust think about it. I wouldn\u2019t make something like that up.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But Porter scoffed when told of Clinton\u2019s reply, noting that he would certainly remember so important an exchange.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhy would anybody believe him?\u201d Porter told The Crimson early this morning. \u201cHe is absolutely correct that I would not have forgotten a conversation like that, and that just buttresses my claim that such a conversation never took place.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In his book, Clinton cited the exchange as one of the primary motivating factors behind his first presidential run in 1992. Though he was comfortably situated in Arkansas at the time and hesitant to abandon his position, Clinton wrote, a telephone call from Porter \u201cshowed what was wrong with [George H. W. Bush\u2019s] administration.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>According to Clinton\u2019s book, Porter\u2014who is Dunster House Master and IBM professor of business and government\u2014said that while other potential Democratic opponents could be undermined through weaknesses grounded in their politics, the Arkansas governor\u2019s voting record made him \u201cdifferent.\u201d According to Clinton, this also made him a prime candidate for a Republican-orchestrated smear campaign.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cSubsequent events sort of confirmed that,\u201d Clinton said early this morning, referring to the scandals that plagued his second term of office. \u201cWhen [the call] happened, I respected it, but I didn\u2019t fold.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Clinton cited conversations he had immediately after the phone call to support his version of the account.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAs soon as I hung up the phone, I called Hillary,\u201d Clinton said this morning, \u201cand then I called Mack McLarty,\u201d his future chief of staff.</span></p> <p><span>But Porter told The Crimson in June that the only conversation he can recall with the Arkansas governor came during President Bush\u2019s 1989 Education Summit with the Governors, where he joked with Clinton about how the rising politician ought to run for president in much the same fashion as Ronald Reagan\u2014as a Republican.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe never had any conversation as he has described in his book,\u201d Porter said in June. \u201cYou don\u2019t remember every conversation in life, but I would certainly remember a conversation like that.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Porter pointed to \u201ctell-tale\u201d signals within the purported dialogue as confirming his version of the account, singling out the use of the word \u201ccrap\u201d in the account. Clinton wrote that Porter broke off a policy conversation with \u201cCut the crap, Governor,\u201d before the alleged threat.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s not the way I talk,\u201d Porter said in June, \u201cand anybody who\u2019s been around me knows that\u2019s not the way I talk.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Porter also rejected the possibility that anyone in George H. W. Bush\u2019s administration would make such a call, stating that discussions of character attacks on Clinton never took place during any of the meetings he attended or was aware of during his time at the White House.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThat was not President Bush\u2019s style or that of those who worked for him,\u201d Porter said in June.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt gives me no particular pleasure to set the historical record straight,\u201d he read this morning from a prepared statement. \u201cI do so for two reasons. First, historians and scholars of the presidency deserve to base their judgments and assessments on facts. Bill Clinton was not propelled, as he claims, into running for president in 1992 in part because he was courageous in responding to threats he received from me or from anyone else. Second, our political system needs more trust and less cynicism...Fabricating stories does not contribute to building the trust that is so needed.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Clinton\u2019s allegations initially surfaced during his first term in office, when Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward learned of the account.</span></p> <p><span>According to the June 23, 2004 edition of the White House Bulletin, provided by Porter to The Crimson, Woodward stated that he did not think Clinton\u2019s assertion about Porter making the threat was credible enough to be included in his 1994 book <i>The Agenda</i>, which he was then working on.</span></p> <p><span>\u201c[It] sounds like someone from \u2018The Sopranos,\u2019\u201d Woodward told the Bulletin. \u201cIt\u2019s an apocryphal story.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>And while Porter agreed that is all Clinton\u2019s version of the events amounts to, he was not quite so quick to dismiss its effects.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think he diminishes the office of the president, which I treasure, when he repeatedly lies,\u201d said Porter this morning. \u201cAnd I think he ought to be ashamed of himself.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Porter teaches the popular course Government 1540: \u201cThe American Presidency.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Clinton accused Porter of deviating from his initial account of what had transpired, claiming that his version had evolved from a difference over details to a flat-out denial.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhen they first asked Roger Porter about it, he didn\u2019t say it didn\u2019t happen,\u201d Clinton said this morning. \u201cHe just said, \u2018It didn\u2019t happen that way.\u2019\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But according to Porter, who was first confronted with the charges by Woodward, his story has remained the same over the course of a decade.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe\u2019s lying,\u201d Porter said this morning. \u201cI have never changed my account of this one whit.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>According to Clinton, neither he nor Porter has attempted to contact the other since the purported incident.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI never heard from or saw Roger Porter again until he attended a reception for White House Fellows when I was President,\u201d Clinton wrote. \u201cI wonder if he ever thinks about that phone call and whether it influenced my decision.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Clinton reiterated this morning that neither he nor Porter has contacted the other since the incident, prompting chuckles from his supposed antagonist.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI talked to him the day before his book came out,\u201d Porter said this morning. \u201cI had a brief conversation with him at the White House portrait ceremony,\u201d on June 14, 2004.</span></p> <p><span>Neither Clinton nor Porter would speculate as to the other\u2019s motives in falsifying his account.</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff writer Timothy J.

His speech addressed why he is running for president and what is wrong with U.S. politics.</span></p> <p><span>Nader\u2019s most obvious complaint was that the creeping increase of corporate influence in government is turning the United States into a de facto dictatorship.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe two major parties are running this country into the ground for corporate campaign contributions,\u201d Nader said. \u201cGeorge W. Bush is a giant corporation disguised as a human being residing in the White House, and his administration was marinated in oil.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Nader's ridiculing of his incumbent opponent drew loud roars from the fiercely anti-Bush attendees, many of whom were lured inside the rally by a demonstrator on the plaza outside the Science Center, where a disgruntled old man, crowned by multi-colored balloons, yelled \u201cFuck Bush!\u201d to help publicize the rally.</span></p> <p><span>But in addition to criticizing the Bush administration, Nader marshaled evidence that Kerry does not support a liberal constituency.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe\u2019s for the war and wants to stay in Iraq, he toes the Sharon party line, he\u2019s for corporate globalization, the WTO and NAFTA, and he voted for the PATRIOT Act\u2014the greatest single assault on civil liberties in the country\u2019s history,\u201d Nader said.</span></p> <p><span>He also faulted Harvard University for being \u201ca processing center for giant corporations.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Nader cited a statistic that 95 percent of the people in his Harvard Law School class are now representing corporations while only 5 percent are representing civic interests.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cPolluters have the lawyers, but people with respiratory diseases don\u2019t have many lawyers,\u201d Nader said.</span></p> <p><span>He also criticized the system that perpetuates a two-party \u201cduopoly,\u201d and in the question-and-answer session following the speech, he supported an instant runoff system instead of the current indirect elections.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe 200-year-old electoral college system ensures that winner takes all,\u201d Nader said. \u201cVoters go for the least-worst and demand nothing because they fear the worst.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Nader also criticized the lack of choice in local and state elections\u2014a trend he said has spread to the national level due to redistricting.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cNinety-five percent of voters are in a one-party-dominated or nominally opposed district,\u201d Nader said. \u201cOf the 435 seats in the House of Representatives, only 25 are competitive. Election implies selection!\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In addition to describing why he was running for president, Nader explained why he had chosen Peter Camejo, a member of the socially responsible investment movement, as his running mate, using anecdotes from Camejo\u2019s past and noting what he thinks Camejo brings to the election.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe\u2019s Latino, and we\u2019ve never had a Latino candidate for V.P.\u2014he speaks Spanish beautifully,\u201d Nader said.</span></p> <p><span>During the question and answer session, Nader fielded several queries concerning his role in the election of 2000 and whether he believes his current campaign weakens that of John F. Kerry, the Democratic candidate.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHow can you sleep at night with the blood of the soldiers who died in Iraq on your hands?\u201d an audience member shouted out.</span></p> <p><span>Nader responded by stating that he is certain that Bush is self-destructing, and that those who live in states where Democrats are expected to win by a wide margin should vote Nader/Camejo.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cBush is a one-term president,\u201d Nader said. \u201cKerry is swinging and missing for four months, but Bush is swinging and socking himself.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>After Nader finished answering questions, a Nader spokesperson attempted to raise money from the crowd for the campaign\u2014which he claims does not accept any corporate donations.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI\u2019m looking for a $1,000 hero,\u201d the spokesperson said.</span></p> <p><span>No such \u201chero\u201d stepped forward, although two individuals came forward to donate $500 each.

About 20 percent changed to support Bush, and the remaining 20 percent switched their intended vote to independent candidate Ralph Nader.</span></p> <p><span>King, who is also an associate professor at the Kennedy School of Government, said the volatility of the youth vote\u2014which he said is higher than that of the overall voting population\u2014shows that the so-called \u201cundecided\u201d voters who do not identify with a candidate until late in the campaign are not the only votes up for grabs.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt is the case that people change their minds,\u201d King said.</span></p> <p><span>Most of those surveyed who switched to Kerry objected to some aspect of the war in Iraq, King said.</span></p> <p><span>But Harvard Republican Club (HRC) Secretary Lauren K. Truesdell \u201906 said a Wednesday United Press International article that featured unnamed sources claiming three nuclear warheads were found in Tikrit, Iraq, could cause a swing back towards Bush.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI obviously have no more knowledge of the truth of that [particular] article than anyone else, but if something big happens to justify the war, that will be a big help to Bush,\u201d Truesdell said.</span></p> <p><span>HRC president Mark T. Silvestri \u201905 was in Honduras and could not be reached for comment.</span></p> <p><span>The poll, which had a five-point margin of error, also showed Kerry with 55 percent of the student vote, to Bush\u2019s 35 percent. In March, Kerry had 50 percent of the vote and Bush 39 percent.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhat you could legitimately say is [Kerry\u2019s] lead is statistically significantly higher among these students,\u201d King said. \u201cDoes it mean it\u2019s actually a 5-point gain for Kerry on top of a 4-point loss for Bush? That\u2019s in question.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The data show that 44 percent of students who switched their support to Kerry from Bush said their primary reason for the move was a general dislike of Bush.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cYoung people I think are not embracing John Kerry. They disdain George Bush,\u201d King said. \u201cThis election among college students is more of a referendum of George Bush than moving to John Kerry. That means it is still Bush\u2019s race to win or lose.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Harvard College Democrats President Andrew J. Frank \u201905 said the positive results for his party are indicative of Kerry\u2019s campaigning efforts.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe\u2019ve known for a while that Bush is not popular. His approval ratings have dropped below 50 percent,\u201d Frank said. \u201c[Voters] may not be completely enthusiastic about Kerry, but he may have relieved a lot of their fears.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But King cautioned that the results are not as positive for Kerry as the 20-point margin might seem to indicate.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf I were John Kerry, I wouldn\u2019t take a whole lot of comfort in these poll results,\u201d King said. \u201cThe students appear to be pretty fickle\u201420 percent have changed their minds over the past five months, and most of them are with Kerry because they don\u2019t like Bush.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Chair of the IOP survey committee Jonathan S. Chavez \u201905 said the survey might not be as accurately representative of the national collegiate population as the March IOP poll because of the decreased sample size.</span></p> <p><span>Half of the surveyed students said Kerry addressed issues they cared about, whereas only 26 percent felt that way about Bush\u2014a result that King said puzzled him.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt hasn\u2019t seemed to me that either candidate has done an especially effective job reaching out to younger people, and both tend to speak about the same issues,\u201d King said.</span></p> <p><span>Truesdell cited what she said were historical patterns of college students being more liberal than the rest of the population as driving the perception of Bush\u2019s inattention to young voters.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think the Bush campaign probably knows they are weaker in the college student demographic than they are perhaps in other demographics,\u201d Truesdell said.</span></p> <p><span>But Truesdell added that she did not expect such a big gap between the candidates on the topic of issues.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI\u2019m surprised because Bush has been talking about issues that matter to students\u2014especially the economy, which is in a great recovery right now,\u201d Truesdell said. \u201c[Respondents] might have interpreted the question as which candidate is talking about the issues in a way that they like, since both candidates are talking about the same issues.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Chavez said he was not surprised by the perception that Kerry paid more attention to students than Bush.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cBush is not caring about this generation and is not talking about the issues students care about,\u201d Chavez said. \u201cSimply put, Kerry is.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The poll may have shown somewhat inflated results for Democrats because independent voters\u2014who King said are easily swayed\u2014might have been influenced by increased media attention to the Kerry camp after Sen.

{"title": "Movie Review: Outfoxed | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>NEW YORK\u2014According to <i>Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch\u2019s War on Journalism</i>, the Fox News Channel is a conservatively biased, pro-Republican network whose \u201cfair and balanced\u201d maxim is nothing less than a lie. A legitimate argument, indeed\u2014and one that calls for a nuanced, gripping and affecting cinematic expos\u00e9.</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately, <i>Outfoxed</i> is not that film. Robert Greenwald\u2019s low-budget documentary, co-sponsored by liberal advocacy groups MoveOn.org and the Center for American Progress, is short, sloppy, occasionally impactful and frequently superfluous. It presents a convincing compilation of damning footage and expert testimony demonstrating Fox\u2019s myriad violations of journalistic ethics, but a key ingredient remains missing. Cinema must be engaging; it must be attractive. Greenwald falls flat on both counts.</span></p> <p><span>Not to say the evidence isn\u2019t compelling. Using dozens of clips from the 24-hour news network and interviews with prominent critics and commentators, Greenwald has pieced together a comprehensive look at how Fox distorts and twists the news.</span></p> <p><span>But unlike its obvious counterpart, <i>Fahrenheit 9/11</i>, <i>Outfoxed</i> fails to translate its abstract ideas to the audience\u2019s level. Michael Moore\u2019s talent as a filmmaker is demonstrating how politics and policy affect the average Joe. Conversely, no apathetic viewer will be swayed by the statistics and wonkish experts Greenwald parades on screen. Without a dash of showmanship, the strains of Greenwald\u2019s sermon will reach only the choir.</span></p> <p><span>The film\u2019s structure, essentially a series of bullet points from \u201cfear\u201d to \u201cO\u2019Reilly,\u201d is bland and dilettantish. The music is dramatic but tinny: the <i>Fahrenheit 9/11</i> score for Nintendo. Worse, the on-screen graphics bring to mind the videos on acids and bases you used to watch in your high school chemistry class. Greenwald calls this \u201cguerrilla\u201d filmmaking; I call it \u201cshoddy.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Most damningly, the film is devoid of humor. In using a clip from \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d Greenwald lets Jon Stewart make the jokes for him. A defter editor would have used the frequently absurd clips from Fox to comedic effect. Instead, the director elicits a few chuckles but misses the belly laughs his material so richly deserves.</span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile, the dark irony of <i>Outfoxed</i> is that its worst offenses are journalistic, not cinematic. Greenwald splices his interview subjects to shreds, constantly cutting their words even as they ostensibly provide important evidence. The effect is the visual equivalent of a sea of ellipses. The practice is prevalent enough to cast doubt on the veracity of the comments (Were they taken out of context? Why can\u2019t we see them uncut?), not an advisable tactic when the subject in question is an allegedly biased and slanted news network.</span></p> <p><span>Furthermore, <i>Outfoxed</i> engages in some of the same tactics utilized by its antagonists. Greenwald holds up polls comparing the political beliefs of Fox viewers to those of patrons of public broadcasting. The numbers are alarming (nearly 70 percent of Fox viewers believed Saddam Hussein was connected to the Sept. 11 attacks, compared to 16 percent of PBS viewers), but causality is unclear.</span></p> <p><span>Greenwald also interviews a kennel of liberal media watchdogs, but does not include, say, Columbia Graduate School of Journalism Dean Nicholas B. Lemann \u201976 (also a former Crimson president), who has offered a more tempered view of Fox\u2019s problems. How are slanted statistics and experts like these any different from those used on \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor\u201d?</span></p> <p><span>The film\u2019s troubles are only compounded by the fact that Greenwald did not approach Fox News for comment. His excuse? Fox \u201cgets its message out every day,\u201d Greenwald said at a press conference here last Monday. Perhaps, but a Bush-bashing story by any legitimate news outlet won\u2019t run without White House comment, despite a press secretary\u2019s daily briefings. Greenwald\u2019s error is a grave one, and <i>Outfoxed</i> suffers for it.</span></p> <p><span>Beyond its surface flaws, does <i>Outfoxed</i> harbor an important message? Yes. Fox\u2019s news coverage is rife with fearmongering, mistruths and rampant partisanship. The most powerful sequence of the film is Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s on-air interview with Jeremy Glick, the son of a Sept. 11 victim. Glick attempted to explain his opposition to Bush\u2019s post-attack foreign policy; an enraged O\u2019Reilly interrupted and browbeat his guest, even asserting that his father \u201cwould not approve of this.\u201d Later, O\u2019Reilly claimed Glick had \u201caccused President Bush of knowing about 9/11 and murdering his own father.\u201d Glick, of course, had said nothing of the sort. Such repugnant behavior is a testament to the network\u2019s hypocrisy and distortion.</span></p> <p><span>Americans need to be exposed to these facts. Fox News\u2019s persistent bias and manipulation is a clear and present danger to the viewing public. Too bad, then, that <i>Outfoxed</i> is a flawed, uninspiring film.</span></p> <p><span>Outfoxed <i>is currently available on DVD. On Tuesday, the film will be screened at the Brattle Theatre in Harvard Square (40 Brattle Street, 617-570-8030). Showtimes are 5:30 p.m. and 7:45 p.m. See outfoxed.org for more details.</i></span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM</i></span></p>"}
{"title": "Lehane's 'Mystic' Mind | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Alan J. Tabak", "body": "<p><span>Hundreds of fans overflowed the pink plush fold-down seats of Science Center C Tuesday to get a look into the mind that created <i>Mystic River</i>, the acclaimed novel of crime and retribution that was made into a star-studded, much-applauded film in 2003.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI would love to believe in a world in which justice prevails, but I don\u2019t see it much,\u201d said Dennis Lehane, the novel\u2019s author, after a free screening of the movie.</span></p> <p><span>In a 45-minute question and answer period, Lehane discussed his personal experience and outlook and how they affected the writing of <i>Mystic River</i>.</span></p> <p><span>Lehane won the Anthony Award and Barry Award for Best Novel for the book, which was published in February 2001. He also won the Massachusetts Book Award in Fiction and was a finalist for the PEN/Winship Award.</span></p> <p><span>The film received widespread critical acclaim and saw two of its leading actors\u2014Sean Penn and Tim Robbins\u2014take home the Academy Award for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor, respectively.</span></p> <p><span>In the opening scenes of the film, the three main characters\u2014then 10 years old\u2014are approached by a man claiming to be a police officer after they write their names in wet cement. The man, whose badge is fake and who is not wearing a uniform, insists on taking Dave Boyle (later played by Robbins) to his mother, shoving him in the back seat of his car. He then sexually molests the boy for four days, setting up the rest of the film.</span></p> <p><span>The three main characters, also including Jimmy Markum (Penn) and Sean Devine (Kevin Bacon), reunite 25 years later when Jimmy\u2019s daughter is brutally murdered.</span></p> <p><span>Lehane said Tuesday that the major inspiration for <i>Mystic River</i> came from a childhood fight in which he participated.</span></p> <p><span>After two police officers initially broke up the fight, Lehane said, he and the other youth resumed their melee. The police returned and drove Lehane and his adversary back to their homes.</span></p> <p><span>Lehane said his mother was alarmed\u2014not because the two boys were fighting, but rather because they never noticed if the officers had been wearing badges.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI can never forget the look on my mom\u2019s face,\u201d Lehane said.</span></p> <p><span>Lehane implied that his character Dave\u2019s abduction was an alternate scenario of what he and his foe might have experienced had their failure to confront the officers about their identities proved more serious.</span></p> <p><span>In addition to that experience, Lehane said he focused on the issue of child molestation after spending several years working with sexually abused children.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhen it comes to politics, I am slightly to the left of Canada,\u201d Lehane said. \u201cBut on one issue, I am to the right of Pat Buchanan. That\u2019s child predators. I think if you\u2019re caught once\u2014life. Chances are, when you\u2019re caught for the first time, you\u2019ve probably already molested six other kids.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI worked with sexually abused kids for several years,\u201d Lehane added. \u201cOnce it\u2019s in the blood, it never comes out.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><b></b></span></p> <p><span>GOOD AND EVIL</span></p> <p><span>Lehane said the underlying confusion of appearance and reality that plays out in the climax of <i>Mystic River</i>\u2014which leads to no definitive \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cevil\u201d characters\u2014is also reflected in his political outlook.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI don\u2019t think human beings are any more dangerous than when they\u2019re sure they\u2019re right,\u201d Lehane said.</span></p> <p><span>Lehane elicited applause from the crowd when he emphasized his point by mocking the Bush administration\u2019s insistence that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction before last year\u2019s invasion.</span></p> <p><span>But Lehane also said he thinks society in general confuses desire for understanding with fair analysis of evidence.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI had a conversation with a person who politically leans like me, but was convinced that Saddam somehow funded the 9/11 attacks,\u201d Lehane said. \u201cI said, \u2018What evidence do you have?\u2019 She said, \u2018I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m so mad.\u2019\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe\u2019ve become a society of infotainment. We like stories, not facts,\u201d Lehane continued. \u201cWe believe a myth, even though there\u2019s no evidence. The idea of <i>Mystic River</i>\u2014get the evidence.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Writing a story with no archetypal characters also made the book more interesting, Lehane said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI always tell students, don\u2019t write a villain who knows he\u2019s evil, because that\u2019s just boring,\u201d Lehane said. \u201cI don\u2019t think even Hitler got up in the morning and looked himself in the mirror and said, \u2018Let\u2019s do some evil.\u2019\u201d</span></p> <p><span><b></b></span></p> <p><span>KEEPING SECRETS</span></p> <p><span>Lehane said he learned the two most important aspects of writing when he was 16 years old. The first, he said, is that a writer never explains elements of a book that are not expressly written.</span></p> <p><span>In keeping with this principle, Lehane bristled when one audience member asked about an ambiguous gesture that Bacon makes towards Penn in the last scene of the movie.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere are a few things in this world that I will never explain, and this is one of those,\u201d Lehane said. \u201cIt\u2019s there to make you think, not for me to say, \u2018Well, actually, it means this.\u2019\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The second lesson Lehane said he learned is that once an author finishes a book, any interpretation of the work that is not totally irrational should not be dismissed.</span></p> <p><span>Lehane challenged the audience to accept varying interpretations of his work after several attendees appeared to seek definitive explanations of the symbolism in <i>Mystic River</i>.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI\u2019ve begun to worry that in America, we can\u2019t hold two ideas in our hand at one time,\u201d Lehane said.</span></p> <p><span><b></b></span></p> <p><span>FROM PAGE TO SCREEN</span></p> <p><span>Lehane\u2014who did not write the screenplay for the film of <i>Mystic River</i> but said that he had been able to review the script before production began\u2014also spoke about adapting his book to the big screen.</span></p> <p><span>The majority of authors feel as if Hollywood screenwriters do not do their books justice, Lehane said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMost people who have film adaptations get really tight smiles on their faces when you ask them about it and say, \u2018Oh yeah\u2014it\u2019s good,\u2019\u201d Lehane said. \u201cIn private, they say bad things about it.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Although Lehane said he enjoyed the film of <i>Mystic River</i>, he added that he did not think the movie was capable of capturing the full force of his book.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI respect the film and am a great admirer of it, but I don\u2019t feel comfortable comparing it to my book,\u201d Lehane said. \u201cEven the greatest film is just a Cliff\u2019s Notes compared to the book.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cBut I\u2019m comfortable with that because I love the film,\u201d he added.</span></p> <p><span>Furthermore, Lehane suggested that he had never expected his words to be flawlessly transferred to the set.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMy feeling about Hollywood is like the joke about the man who came out of a whorehouse and said he didn\u2019t feel loved,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Lehane admitted that a significant difference between books and movies is that in a movie, each scene has to advance the plot.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere\u2019s a scene in the book where Sean goes and talks to his father about the day Dave was abducted 25 years ago,\u201d Lehane said, explaining that the scene does not appear in the film. \u201cIt\u2019s the best scene I\u2019ve ever written, but it had nothing to do with the plot.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Lehane added that he lamented a subplot in both versions of <i>Mystic River</i> involving the character Sean and his estranged wife because it was too peripheral to the core of the movie.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI fought for it, and I regret it to this day,\u201d Lehane said. \u201cIt never worked in the book, and it didn\u2019t work in the movie.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>One of the final questions for Lehane was about casting. While he said he had no role in that process, he was pleased with the choices of actors to play his characters.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMy favorite moment was when [Director Clint Eastwood] called me up and said he wanted to cast Laurence Fishburne as Whitey,\u201d Lehane said. \u201cI love Laurence Fishburne, and it\u2019s so cool to have a black character named Whitey.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In response to the final question from the audience, Lehane offered a piece of succinct advice.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cRead the book, damn it,\u201d Lehane said. \u201cCome on, Daddy needs a new pair of shoes.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff writer Alan J.

{"title": "No Scholar Left Behind | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>WASHINGTON\u2014Let this serve as fair warning\u2014good news rarely entertains.</span></p> <p><span>Recently, the 2004 U.S. Presidential Scholars gathered in the nation\u2019s capital to be honored by the President of the United States. With two students from each state and a handful at large, these were some of the nation\u2019s brightest and most accomplished high school students, selected through lengthy review by the Department of Education. I had the lucky job of working as one of the students\u2019 advisers during the weeklong recognition event in D.C.</span></p> <p><span>Amid the great anticipation of scholars, President Bush seized the opportunity to publicly promote the virtues of education in a heartfelt, inspiring (and grammatically-correct) speech. It was a message of hope and celebration; it was proof that a shared priority of education could strengthen our nation and even transcend the boundaries of partisanship.</span></p> <p><span>Well, not exactly. Unfortunately, this noble action was no more than the figment of an imagination waxing pathetic. In reality, President Bush, despite repeated appeals from the Department of Education, simply could not be convinced to attend. A similar fate had arisen the previous year, when I was a scholar: Bush found time to meet with NCAA athletes in the White House just days before he was due to meet the Presidential Scholars, but when the scholars\u2019 moment for recognition came, he never showed.</span></p> <p><span>So enter the political foe\u2014John Kerry, perhaps, or Ralph Nader, if that\u2019s your thing\u2014who smartly identifies this as an opportune moment to present his own vision for American education, a foil to Bush\u2019s stale and recycled rhetoric. He points out the obvious: that true education isn\u2019t just about leaving no child behind, but about moving all children forward\u2014about actively encouraging a culture of excellence.</span></p> <p><span>Needless to say, none of this happened, either.</span></p> <p><span>And really, one might be tempted to ask, who could blame Bush or Kerry for what amounts to relatively benign neglect?  It is, after all, election year, and there are far bigger fish to fry. Yet it is precisely this mentality that reveals one of the most troubling contradictions nestled within our culture: the demand for and expectation of excellence, coupled paradoxically with indifference when excellence is attained.</span></p> <p><span>The Presidential Scholars program, in recent years, has suffered under the hand of this paradox. Created in 1964 by President Lyndon B. Johnson to both honor a select group of students and \u201csymbolically [honor] all graduating high school seniors of high potential,\u201d it historically has served to celebrate outstanding achievement and, more importantly, promote the values associated with the pursuit of noble aspirations.</span></p> <p><span>But good news is hard to sell\u2014it\u2019s always been this way. Our culture thrives on sensationalism, on grotesqueness and intrigue. Teen idols and school shootings captivate far more easily than stories of increased volunteerism among young people or displays of exemplary leadership. The implicit message is clear: Money, fame or quick glory may turn heads, but quieter excellence simply doesn\u2019t entertain.</span></p> <p><span>So I probably shouldn\u2019t have been surprised when Bush failed to make an appearance, even considering that it was an election year. I did think that he would be hungry for opportunities to bolster his campaign, or at the very least buff his public image a bit before the voting booths went up. What I forgot to factor in was the reality that what attracts the media, and voters in turn, determines what politicians emphasize in their quests for popularity. And who was I kidding? Bright, enthusiastic, cancer-curing, symphony-composing 18-year-olds don\u2019t usually make for very exciting headlines. In a faceoff against the NCAA for the president\u2019s attention, it\u2019s no wonder they didn\u2019t stand a chance.</span></p> <p><span>And of course, it wasn\u2019t Bush\u2019s physical absence itself that was so troublesome, but rather the general complacency and indifference that his neglect, in a way, epitomized. Many of the scholars actually disapproved of Bush\u2019s presidency; but each, regardless of political persuasion, also expected him to uphold the sacred traditions that had been respected by every president since the program\u2019s conception. Though I reasoned flippantly that scratching the ears of Bush\u2019s dog Barney, whom we happened to encounter on our White House tour, was really just as exciting as shaking the hand of George W. Bush, in my heart I couldn\u2019t blame the scholars for finding the whole thing just a bit disappointing, or just a tad disrespectful.</span></p> <p><span>But perhaps such a bleak outlook is slightly hyperbolic. Even without Bush\u2019s presence, the Presidential Scholars program continues to be a dynamic and determined force of hope. And after spending a week with the scholars, shuttling them around D.C., bonding over Frisbee and sharing dreams for the future, my optimism can\u2019t help but overwhelm the aspect of disillusionment. I\u2019m still confident that the gap between what society passively expects (a good education) and what it actively values (a good time) will eventually be bridged. We will finally learn that while no news may be good news, the converse is certainly not true. And even though it may be that only after society itself undergoes a revamping of values will our trustworthy politicians follow suit, I still contend that it\u2019s not too naive to hope for a leader with enough vision to take initiative in what he believes is right\u2014even if the cameras aren\u2019t clicking away, and even if his good deed doesn\u2019t automatically translate into an extra stash of ballots.</span></p> <p><span><i>Rena Xu \u201907, a biochemistry concentrator in Eliot House, is an editorial editor of The Crimson.

McSorley \u201906 said last month. \u201cI really do believe this issue will change as our generation grows older.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Kerry\u2019s opponent in the November election, President George W. Bush, advocates a constitutional ban on same-sex marriages, and the Harvard Republican Club (HRC) \u201cstands with the president\u201d on the issue, club spokesperson Lauren Truesdell \u201906 told The Crimson last month.</span></p> <p><span>But this stance has prompted criticism from member Joshua A. Barro \u201905, who organized a group of Republicans in support of gay marriage to travel to City Hall on the night couples were first allowed to file for licenses.</span></p> <p><span>HRC members have been engaged in debate over their e-mail list, with Barro and others arguing that the Republican Party offers no clear statement about a federal ban.</span></p> <p><span>They say that without an official party platform or a decision by the club\u2019s executive board, the HRC should not take a public stance on an issue on which its membership is divided.</span></p> <p><span>According to a Crimson poll conducted last December, 49 percent of students who would vote Republican in a hypothetical Congressional election said they supported the court\u2019s ruling in favor of same-sex marriages, while 43 percent said they disagreed with the decision.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s clear that Lauren overstepped her bounds by making that statement on behalf of the club,\u201d Barro says.</span></p> <p><span>Truesdell says the club stands by its statement, although the board may discuss its policy when it returns in the fall.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe are bound by our constitution to follow the party platform, and I took that to by extension mean the policies of the sitting president, who is the head of the party,\u201d Truesdell says.</span></p> <p><span>In the past Harvard has had two Republican clubs taking different positions on social issues. Barro says he believes it is best to have one club focused on less divisive topics such as supporting the \u201cwar on terror\u201d or limited government, as long as it refrains from taking stances on contentious social issues such as abortion and gay marriage. But he adds that he would consider the possibility of forming a new club if HRC\u2019s leaders take stances he opposes.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI, as a person who is not a social conservative, don\u2019t feel at home in this club if we\u2019re going to be going out there and expressing our support for the [constitutional ban on same-sex marriage], for policies where the government attempts to impose moral order on the public,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think the club has to be an organization that takes stances on issues that are divisive among Republicans at Harvard. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s particularly productive.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But Truesdell says she does not believe that the club should avoid socially divisive issues, adding that members often differ with the party on some parts of the platform but \u201caccept that there are more important things\u201d that led them to support the party.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think it\u2019s very important that we support national policy because it makes our club stronger,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re the Republican club. That means we support Republican beliefs. Whether or not they are fashionable on our particular campus is not so much the issue.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff writer Jessica R.

{"title": "Under the Lights: Summers Addresses National Audience | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>When former University President Neil L. Rudenstine first appeared on the cover of a national magazine, Newsweek, it was for taking a three-month hiatus in 1994 to recover from exhaustion.</span></p> <p><span>University President Lawrence H. Summers had already graced the cover of Time when he was selected to succeed Rudenstine in March 2001.</span></p> <p><span>And when The New York Times Magazine made Summers its cover profile last August, it was for his time on\u2014not off\u2014the job.</span></p> <p><span>So it comes as no surprise that pieces on the former Secretary of the Treasury are slated to run in the pages of The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post this week alone.</span></p> <p><span>In his first three years as Harvard\u2019s 27th president, Summers has, by all accounts, fashioned himself as one of the most high-profile university presidents of the last half-century.</span></p> <p><span>He has not hesitated to pound the bully pulpit on issues of importance to Harvard and higher education, from affirmative action to financial aid.</span></p> <p><span>So far, the world is listening.</span></p> <p><span>From phone calls with top Washington officials to front-page coverage in the national media, Summers has made waves, trading on the Harvard name to plug an agenda that he says will bolster the University\u2019s standing and, in turn, his own public image.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s sort of a judgment of how to best advance the interests of the University,\u201d Summers says in an interview.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever tried to speak out on issues that were apart from the University,\u201d he adds, noting that he has attempted to \u201cspeak out quite consistently on issues in which there is a clear higher education nexus that seemed of national importance and that advances Harvard\u2019s interests\u2014and hopefully advances the country\u2019s interests as well.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In doing so, Summers has been increasingly careful to choose his battles from his presidential perch, speaking out in recent months on equal opportunity and financial aid in education and the importance of sciences and international awareness in a liberal arts education, while dodging more controversial political issues. In the process, he has meticulously cultivated his image as a leader on both national and educational issues.</span></p> <p><span>Summers has also maintained ties to Washington, keeping up with his former colleagues from the Clinton administration. He is widely considered one of the top Democratic contenders to replace Chairman of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan upon his departure in 2006.</span></p> <p><span>Summers will not comment on a return to Washington.</span></p> <p><span>But for now, he is using his Washington connections and Washington-born fame to solidify the University\u2019s role\u2014and his own image\u2014at the vanguard of higher education.</span></p> <p><span><b>STEPPING TO THE PULPIT</b></span></p> <p><span>Rudenstine was going to be the first president to make an official Harvard visit to Latin America. But when he took three months off to nurse himself back to health, the trip was cancelled.</span></p> <p><span>That excursion, which had been planned for January 1995, did not materialize until March 2004, when Summers jetted off to Latin America for spring break.</span></p> <p><span>In Santiago, Summers met with Chilean President Ricardo Lagos and members of his cabinet. He also addressed the U.N. Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean on the importance of teaching and research at universities.</span></p> <p><span>And in Sao Paulo, Summers met with former Brazilian President Fernando Cardoso and also delivered a major speech.</span></p> <p><span>During a year in which he visited London and Davos, Switzerland, the Latin American trip highlighted the increasingly international role Summers has played as University president.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think that one of the really important transitions underway is towards becoming a more global university,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cInevitably, that will mean that University leaders will travel more widely than they have in the past.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>He added that Harvard has a broader role to play in society, not only abroad, but in the United States as well.</span></p> <p><span>This year, he put a little money where his mouth is, committing $2 million to addressing what he calls \u201cour greatest domestic concern today\u201d\u2014inequality.</span></p> <p><span>The initiative\u2014which eliminated the student financial aid contribution for families with incomes under $40,000 and reduced it for families with incomes between $40,000 and $60,000\u2014was rolled out to much fanfare at the annual conference of the American Council of Education in Miami this February.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe want to send the strongest possible message that Harvard is open to talented students from all economic backgrounds,\u201d Summers told the conference. \u201cWe are determined to change both the perception and the reality.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>After the speech, Summers launched an aggressive media campaign to publicize the initiative, going on NPR and speaking with a wide range of other media outlets. He has also touted the initiative and addressed the issue of economic inequality in countless speeches since February.</span></p> <p><span>Summers had purchased a spate of positive publicity and a few more turns in the national media.</span></p> <p><span>With affirmative action up for the first major challenge in its 25-year history, Summers co-wrote an op-ed in The New York Times with Tyler Professor of Constitutional Law Laurence H. Tribe \u201962. Tribe also authored a friend-of-the-court brief\u2014co-signed by seven other universities\u2014trumpeting Harvard\u2019s policy in urging the Court to uphold the University of Michigan\u2019s policy.</span></p> <p><span>Facing an across-the-board drop in graduate admissions from abroad this spring, Summers fired off public letters to Secretary of State Colin Powell and Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge \u201967, pressing them to address the bottleneck in student visas that was deterring applicants from coming to Harvard and other American schools.</span></p> <p><span>Summers says \u201cthere was a very clear need to bring public pressure to bear\u201d on visas because \u201cit was an issue directly affecting Harvard\u2019s competitiveness internationally.\u201d He adds that he was \u201cencouraged by those within the government\u201d to push forward on the issue.</span></p> <p><span>In a now-famous September 2002 morning prayers address, Summers said that divestment\u2014a drive urging Harvard to disinvest from holdings in Israel because of alleged human rights violations\u2014and similar movements singling out Israel were \u201canti-Semitic in their effect if not their intent.\u201d In that address, he expressed his concern from a very personal perspective, despite its strong impact on campus.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI speak with you today not as president of the University but as a concerned member of our community,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League, says Summers\u2019 remarks stood out because despite his rhetoric, he was still a university president\u2014the first such leader to address the divestment movement.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt was unusual, because there seems to have been a reluctance around the university community for any condemnation of anti-Semitic behavior or behavior that would result in anti-Semitic impact,\u201d Foxman says.</span></p> <p><span>Summers\u2019 remarks on divestment attracted attention in large part due to the criticism he drew, from faculty and a Crimson editorial, for stifling debate.</span></p> <p><span>Nonetheless, Summers\u2019 message reverberated far beyond the walls of Harvard Yard.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt did focus attention on the subject to an extent it hadn\u2019t been before\u2014many more people found it outrageous,\u201d Foxman says. \u201cThe fact that it was Harvard, the fact that it was the president, did at the end of the day focus the outside community\u2019s attention on the issue.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Even in Washington, when Summers talks, people listen.</span></p> <p><span>The visa letter, for instance, landed Summers phone calls with Powell and Ridge.</span></p> <p><span>Corporation member Robert D. Reischauer \u201963 says Summers\u2019 high profile and long-standing Washington relationships have benefited the University in allowing Summers better access to top government officials.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThat gives Harvard a much stronger voice on all sorts of matters,\u201d says Reischauer, who directed the Congressional Budget Office from 1989 to 1995.</span></p> <p><span>Barry Toiv, director of communications and public affairs for the Association of American Universities, says that while the leaders of most major universities would be heard by government officials, Summers\u2019 preexisting relations are important.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cOf course it doesn\u2019t hurt to be on a first name basis already with a lot of the people you might want to speak with,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>Summers has remained prominent both because of who he is\u2014Harvard\u2019s president\u2014and who he was\u2014secretary of the Treasury. Both have drawn him considerable media attention.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to tease out when he speaks and the press wants to talk to him on a follow-up whether it\u2019s because of Harvard\u2019s visibility or his or both combined,\u201d says Vice President for Government, Community and Public Affairs Alan J. Stone. \u201cHarvard in itself is a very special public relations case.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Reischauer adds that his ties to the national press corps increases his public visibility when he speaks out.</span></p> <p><span>The upshot has been a slew of fawning national media attention, from what Summers acknowledges was a flattering New York Times Magazine profile, lauding his bold activism on campus, to puff question-and-answer pieces in Time and The Wall Street Journal, to a spate of other positive stories on the curricular review and other Summers issues.</span></p> <p><span>Toiv says Summers\u2019 high profile is not historically unusual for a school like Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe had a head start as a public figure, and that fits very well with the traditional role of Harvard presidents [who] have used the bully pulpit to speak out on issues relating to higher education as well as other important national issues,\u201d Toiv says. \u201cHarvard has had this traditional role because Harvard is Harvard.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><b>REPUDIATING RUDY?</b></span></p> <p><span>Summers does not just present a marked contrast to the more internally-minded Rudenstine, but he also towers above most of his presidential peers in stature. While Rudenstine maintained a low profile on Mass. Ave., Summers developed a high profile on Pennsylvania Avenue.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf you stopped random people on the street in Washington or in New York and asked who was the president of Harvard and who was the president of Stanford and Yale, I\u2019m sure Larry\u2019s name recognition would be 10 times any of the other presidents,\u201d Reischauer says. \u201cPeople know who he is, respect the job he did in Washington\u2014even those who disagreed with it.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Only a few university presidents\u2014like Summers and Columbia President Lee C. Bollinger\u2014have national name recognition.</span></p> <p><span>And the fact that Summers and Bollinger were two of the four finalists in Harvard\u2019s 2001 presidential search is no accident. Some members of the search committee had decided they wanted a president better suited to the limelight than Rudenstine and his peers.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cSome members of the [Harvard] Corporation during the search process thought that it would be a desirable feature, not a necessary one, if the president were to speak out, use the bully pulpit more than other presidents have,\u201d says one well-informed administrator.</span></p> <p><span>Robert E. Rubin \u201960\u2014a close Summers friend, his former boss at the Treasury and a Corporation member who has been appointed since Summers\u2019s selection\u2014says that he thinks Summers was chosen because as \u201cHarvard faced a new century,\u201d the Corporation wanted it to do so \u201cwith a president who was going to engage with the issues that Harvard has to deal with now.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThey knew what they were getting,\u201d the administrator says. \u201cThey expected Summers to be more outspoken than any other president.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Georgetown Law Professor Daniel K. Tarullo, who has known Summers since their time on the Dukakis campaign and later as a colleague who advised former President Bill Clinton on economics, says that he \u201chad assumed that the Corporation would not offer the presidency to Summers unless the Corporation had wanted a broad-ranging president who would be a leading figure in American education.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhy would they want a man who had expanded the scope of every job that he had been in...unless they wanted a president like that,\u201d Tarullo says. \u201cIt seems that has been exactly what they have gotten.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Professor of Economics Lawrence F. Katz notes that in recent times, the Harvard president\u2019s role has fluctuated between public figure and internal administrator, noting the prominence of former University Presidents James B. Conant \u201914 and Derek C. Bok compared with the relative obscurity of Nathan M. Pusey \u201928 and Rudenstine. He added that the Corporation was aware of Summers\u2019 \u201clong history of being engaged with political issues\u201d when they chose him.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf you look at the history of Harvard, there has always been a movement back and forth between those who have been more internal and more fundraisers,\u201d Katz says, noting that the selection committee had clearly swung back toward the public model of university president.</span></p> <p><span>Reischauer said the feedback he\u2019s heard has been \u201chighly positive.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAnd almost always in the form, \u2018well it\u2019s about time,\u2019\u201d Reischauer says. \u201cNot with respect to Larry or Harvard, but with respect to the great universities of America coming out of their shells.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><b>MANICURING THE IMAGE</b></span></p> <p><span>When he arrived in Cambridge, Summers said he had learned in Washington to temper his public opinions.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cYou learned very quickly that the right way to handle things was to speak with restraint,\u201d Summers said in 2001. \u201cBeing provocative and interesting wasn\u2019t always good.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>While Summers understood that being secretary of the Treasury involved constant media scrutiny, it\u2019s taken some time for him to adjust to the critical eye that many have aimed him at Harvard, Reischauer says.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhen you\u2019re new in a job, you have to figure out how to ride the horse. I think he\u2019s adapted quite well,\u201d he says. \u201cI think he realized very quickly that it\u2019s very hard just to speak to the Harvard community without there being someone who\u2019s going to take interest in it in the national media.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Early on in his tenure, Summers drew fire for two high-profile incidents: a reported tiff with former Fletcher University Professor Cornel R. West \u201974 and his denouncement of the divestment movement.</span></p> <p><span>Summers told the Wall Street Journal earlier this week that the divestment movement has fizzled since his morning prayers address.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cOver the last year and a half, since my speech, the divestment issue has faded away,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>But Summers has tackled less controversial issues since the anti-Semitism flare-up, a trend he insists is entirely incidental.</span></p> <p><span>At his morning prayers address this past September about the morality of economics, he noted that he intended to duck the hailstorm of controversy sparked by his previous morning prayers appearance.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhatever their merits, I think it fair to say that my observations [last year] did not go unnoticed,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope my remarks today will be cause for reflection but trust that that reflection will be rather more private and local than followed my remarks last year.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Nonetheless, his outspokenness remains a difficult pill for many faculty to swallow.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cEven if he\u2019s saying good things, it seems a little too much like Washington and playing to the media, and faculty just generally don\u2019t like that, even if it\u2019s serving good causes,\u201d one professor says. \u201cAnd here, some of the causes they don\u2019t agree with.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Summers says his criteria in picking his battles is to find issues of importance to higher education.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWith respect to other public controversies that have a partisan nature and do not have a nexus with the university, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate for university presidents to comment,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>Summers is cautious about proselytizing even in the most informal arenas on campus\u2014and even when his political views as a former cabinet member in a Democratic administration might seem relatively obvious, he consistently declines to comment on President Bush\u2019s economic policy, only making occasional veiled references to his presumed disapproval.</span></p> <p><span>He agreed to address a student\u2019s question about his views on the war in Iraq only \u201coff the record\u201d at an open Mather House study break in April.</span></p> <p><span>When asked about the relationship of the United States and the U.N. at a Winthrop House study break, Summers asked, \u201cIs anyone covering this for The Crimson?\u201d Only when the answer was \u201cno\u201d did he address the question, noting that over the past few years the United States has made large tactical errors that have resulted in losing the world\u2019s sympathy gained after the Sept. 11 attacks, according to a student who attended.</span></p> <p><span>Reischauer says it\u2019s tough to strike a balance between being outspoken and being radical.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt would be unrealistic to say that there are no constraints on an individual in Larry\u2019s position,\u201d Reischauer says. \u201cHe is representing a great and diverse institution\u2014that\u2019s his day job, which you don\u2019t want to jeopardize. At the same time you don\u2019t want to forgo an opportunity to make the world a better place.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Finding the right level of publicity is no easy task for a Harvard president, according to former Dean of the Faculty Jeremy R. Knowles.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe so-called \u2018bully pulpit\u2019 is a chain around the neck of any president,\u201d said then-Dean Knowles upon Summers\u2019 arrival in 2001. \u201cSay too much, and you are excoriated for exploiting the Harvard name for a personal\u2014or even an institutional\u2014agenda. Say too little, and you\u2019re accused of failing to use the opportunities that your position provides.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Summers\u2019 predecessor Rudenstine was assailed for his lack of presence with students. And he certainly kept a lower national profile than Summers, spending much of his time fundraising.</span></p> <p><span>But Rudenstine insisted that it was the key to his internal University successes.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cOtherwise, you really begin to substitute communications and media relations for the true business of the institution,\u201d he said as he left office. \u201cThat would be a disaster.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Disaster or not, Summers has certainly built a \u201ccommunications and media relations\u201d machine at the University, expanding the role of the Office of News and Public Affairs and hiring\u2014for the first time in Harvard\u2019s history\u2014a personal spokesperson.</span></p> <p><span>In part, that\u2019s because Summers brought nearly unmatched recognition into the job. In part, it\u2019s because he\u2019s the president of the world\u2019s most famous university. (Summers gets 40 to 50 media requests each day, according to his handlers in the news office.)</span></p> <p><span>But not least of all, it\u2019s because he is closely manicuring his image as both economist and higher education advocate, while striving to pacify critics.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe is just generally sensitive to his political image in the broader sense, not just with regard to Washington,\u201d a well-informed administrator says. \u201cThe contrast with other presidents I\u2019ve known is considerable\u2014he\u2019s very attentive to how he appears.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Professor of the History of Science Everett I. Mendelsohn says Summers has tried to exert much more influence over Dean of the Faculty William C. Kirby and Dean of the College Benedict H. Gross \u201971 than his predecessors, noting that \u201cthey feel constraints from across the old Yard\u201d\u2014where University administration building Mass. Hall sits.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cRudenstine gave University Hall [the Faculty and College administration building] a large degree of autonomy on how they handled most things,\u201d he says. \u201cI think Summers wants a lot more influence\u2014I felt that on a number of occasions on the Faculty Council, when we would be told, directly or indirectly, that the president really did want something to happen.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Mendelsohn adds that Summers refused a faculty request for addressing homeland security questions through an ad hoc committee and was similarly possessive of handling the response to visa questions.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe wanted to handle it through the president\u2019s office,\u201d Mendelsohn says.</span></p> <p><span>Dan Glickman, who directs the Institute of Politics and served in the Clinton cabinet with Summers, says his choice of topics has been reflective of this attention to image.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe has picked and chosen his issues wisely\u2014by and large he has enhanced his reputation at Harvard nationally and internationally,\u201d Glickman says. \u201cHe has recognized that you have to be a good politician to be a good president.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><b>MR. SUMMERS GOES TO WASHINGTON</b></span></p> <p><span>But the question is, in trying to be a good president, is he also trying to be a good politician?</span></p> <p><span>Though Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., said in January that Summers had given advice to him during his primary campaign, Summers insists he\u2019s avoided any active political role because the Harvard presidency should not be a partisan position.</span></p> <p><span>Nonetheless, Summers remains close with many in Washington and is a frontrunner, under a Kerry administration, to replace Alan Greenspan when his tenure as Chairman of the Federal Reserve expires in 2006, according to several published reports.</span></p> <p><span>Over the last year, Summers has co-chaired a highly-publicized Council on Foreign Relations task force with former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger \u201950. They concluded their year-long work in March, when Summers traveled to D.C. to release the findings: the United States\u2019 relationship with Europe is strained and both sides must work to bridge the gap. He has also begun to speak out on major economic issues separate from the academy, like the lecture he delivered to the Institute for International Economics on the problem of low American savings and his trip to Davos, Switzerland for the World Economic Forum.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe is a leading economist of his day, so it is quite natural for him to comment on issues relating to the world economy,\u201d Katz says.</span></p> <p><span>Rubin even says he should address more economic issues of public interest.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think it would be good for him to speak out from time to time, on economic issues,\u201d Rubin says.</span></p> <p><span>Summers says his public stances\u2014frequently on national issues\u2014do not represent political stances, instead marking important advocacy for higher education or areas of Summers\u2019 academic expertise.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI feel that having been here a little longer I have probably been more active in speaking on public issues kinds of broad public concern in higher education this year than in the first two years of my presidency,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>But one administrator says that while he does not seem to be interested in Washington, he would strive to give off that appearance even if he were so inclined.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe sees people, but he doesn\u2019t give the impression as somebody who\u2019s trying to keep his Washington contacts so that he might go back there,\u201d the administrator says. \u201cIf he were doing this, he wouldn\u2019t want people here to know\u2014because Summers is himself aware of this speculation, he\u2019s being very careful. If he had any intention or aspirations of that sort, he would not show it to anybody and go out of his way to avoid it.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Reischauer says he thinks Summers seems to be having a \u201cgood time\u201d as the president of Harvard, and while he\u2019s sure Summers is on many insiders\u2019 short lists to replace Greenspan, the issue has not been discussed by the Corporation.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMy view is he has a better job now\u2014my guess is he feels that now,\u201d Reischauer says. \u201cThis is a fellow who\u2019s already been in the cabinet. A lot of people would argue that the job of Treasury secretary...is a lot more interesting than Chairman of the Fed.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Rubin adds that he doesn\u2019t think that Washington is \u201cwhere his focus has been\u201d recently.</span></p> <p><span>While Katz notes that Summers, due to his economic preeminence, is an obvious candidate for Kerry to look to, he says he doesn\u2019t believe Summers will take a political position.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHis very long-term future is at Harvard,\u201d Katz says.</span></p> <p><span>But Rubin also says that much lies ahead for Summers. \u201cI think he\u2019s got a lot left in him,\u201d he says, adding that he has \u201cno idea what [Summers] is going to do\u201d after Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>Summers declined to comment on whether he would accept another Washington job if offered it.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI love my job and I love it more than I did two years ago,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Of course he does: he\u2019s recast his image from the \u201cbull in a China shop\u201d of the Cornel West era to the educational visionary of today, gaining publicity and shedding critics along the way.</span></p> <p><span>And that combination of shrewd self-projection and political endurance is exactly what makes him such an attractive candidate to be Chairman of the Fed.</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff writer Stephen M.

Eck and Dorothy A. Austin stood outside a packed Cambridge City Hall, watching the ruling come to life and looking forward to a wedding of their own.</span></p> <p><span>Over 225 same-sex couples raced to file for their marriage licenses in Cambridge when the ruling took effect at midnight on May 17, but Eck and Austin opted to avoid the rush and have since announced plans to marry on July 4 in Memorial Church.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt will be a celebration of our constitution, our nation, the courts\u2014it\u2019s a wonderful day. And there will forever be fireworks on our anniversary,\u201d said Austin, who is a lecturer at Harvard Divinity School and associate minister at Memorial Church.</span></p> <p><span>Cambridge\u2014a city dubbed \u201cthe People\u2019s Republic\u201d and well known for its liberal leanings\u2014prided itself on being the first municipality in the nation to allow same-sex couples to file for state-sanctioned marriage licenses.</span></p> <p><span>Members of the Bisexual, Gay, Lesbian, Transgender and Supporters Alliance (BGLTSA), along with a large contingent of other Harvard students, traveled to City Hall to witness the early-morning festivities.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cNo one that went to the event walked away without being touched and affected by it,\u201d said Mayor Michael A. Sullivan. \u201cNo matter how people felt about the underlying issue, you really walked away touched and reinvigorated in terms of the depth of human compassion.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The reaction on campus was largely positive, reflecting the fact that about 77 percent of students said in a mid-December Crimson poll that they supported the SJC ruling.</span></p> <p><span>But as same-sex weddings continue across the state, opponents are gearing up to challenge gay marriage on both the state and national levels, leading to uncertainty about the ruling\u2019s long-term legacy.</span></p> <p><span><b>SAYING \u2018I DO\u2019</b></span></p> <p><span>The SJC paved the way for last month\u2019s same-sex weddings with its landmark ruling on Nov. 18 declaring that homosexual couples have a constitutional right to marry.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cBarred access to the protections, benefits and obligations of civil marriage, a person who enters into an intimate, exclusive union with another of the same sex is arbitrarily deprived of membership in one of our community\u2019s most rewarding and cherished institutions,\u201d the court declared in its majority opinion, written by Chief Justice Margaret H. Marshall, Harvard\u2019s former general counsel.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThat exclusion is incompatible with  the constitutional principles of respect for individual autonomy and equality under law,\u201d the 4-3 decision continued.</span></p> <p><span>The court delayed its ruling from taking effect for 180 days in order to allow the legislature to make the necessary changes to the state laws.</span></p> <p><span>The SJC opinion provoked immediate criticism from gay marriage opponents including Gov. W. Mitt Romney, who advocated for an amendment to the state constitution limiting marriage to heterosexual couples as a way to circumvent the court\u2019s ruling.</span></p> <p><span>But Cambridge politicians were just as quick to praise the decision, with two councillors announcing the day after the ruling that they would take steps to begin issuing same-sex marriage licenses in the city immediately, despite the 180-day stay period.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhen you\u2019re in a community that has been denied their rights and privileges for such a long time, then you will understand our impatience,\u201d E. Denise Simmons, an openly gay councillor and one of the co-sponsors of the order, told the council at their Nov. 24 meeting. \u201cWhether the state wants to give us licenses or not, I think Cambridge should do it anyway.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But after lawyers advised them that licenses issued before the end of the 180-day period might be subject to legal challenges that would further delay the process, the councillors voted instead to begin granting licenses \u201cas soon as legally possible.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cTo push forward now would simply drag the process out in a legal quagmire that would probably take more than 180 days,\u201d said Councillor Brian P. Murphy \u201986-\u201987, the other co-sponsor of the original order. \u201cThis is an exciting time and I want to move forward as quickly as we can.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><b>\u2018GOING TO THE CHAPEL\u2019</b></span></p> <p><span>Six months later, Cambridge began issuing licenses as soon as legally possible, allowing couples to file forms declaring their intention to marry at midnight on May 17.</span></p> <p><span>As hundreds of couples streamed into City Hall the night before, Superintendent of Schools Thomas Fowler-Finn and Chief Public Health Officer Harold Cox, decked out in tuxedoes, handed out numbers to each couple indicating their place in line to file the forms.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWelcome to Cambridge for this historic long-awaited event,\u201d read the instructions given to each couple as they entered the building, which was decorated with wreaths and ribbons for the occasion.</span></p> <p><span>As members of the media from across the country\u2014and some from as far away as Great Britain and The Netherlands\u2014gathered nearby in a roped-off section, some of the couples turned the lens back on them, recording all aspects of the night on their hand-held video cameras for posterity.</span></p> <p><span>Sullivan Chamber was packed with the couples and their supporters who gathered an hour before midnight to listen to speeches and musical performances as a digital clock counted down the minutes until gay marriage became legal.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI just want to be here as part of history,\u201d said State Sen. Jarrett T. Barrios \u201990, an openly gay politician and vocal advocate of same-sex marriage who was on hand to watch the festivities.</span></p> <p><span>In her invocation, Rev. Irene Monroe likened the occasion to the legalization of interracial marriage or the Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education, which occurred 50 years to the day before gay marriage became legal.</span></p> <p><span>She added that the traditional wedding pronouncement of a couple as \u201cman and wife\u201d could now change to \u201chusband and husband,\u201d \u201cwife and wife\u201d or \u201cspouse and spouse.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cBut my favorite is this: \u2018I now pronounce you married,\u2019\u201d Monroe said, with the ovation growing louder as she continued, \u201cunder the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The Cambridge Community Chorus drew smiles and got some in the chamber to sing along to their rendition of the Beatles\u2019 \u201cCan\u2019t Buy Me Love.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Mary Bonauto of the Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders, the lead attorney on behalf of the gay couples in the SJC case, received thunderous applause as the crowd chanted her name.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis decision was controversial in the eyes of some, courageous in the eyes of others,\u201d she said of the SJC ruling. \u201cBut I think we will all come to see that this decision was undoubtedly correct.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>As couples listened to the speakers and music, some of them wiped away tears, others held each other and one couple sang quietly under their breath, \u201cWe\u2019re going to the chapel and we\u2019re going to get married.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>And the ceremony was punctuated with cheers from the throngs gathered outside who filled the City Hall lawn and across Mass. Ave.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI\u2019ve never been so proud to be from Cambridge,\u201d said Arthur Lipkin of the Cambridge Lavender Alliance, a gay and lesbian advocacy group.</span></p> <p><span>He added after hearing cheers from outside, \u201cThey\u2019ve never been so proud to be from Cambridge!\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The couples who filed in Cambridge were among over one thousand same-sex couples to be married across Massachusetts in the first days after the court ruling took effect.</span></p> <p><span>Twenty-three couples in Cambridge and more across the state obtained court waivers of the three-day waiting period and received their marriage licenses on May 17.</span></p> <p><span><b>AFTER THE HONEYMOON</b></span></p> <p><span>Following the court decision in Massachusetts, several other communities across the nation\u2014from Oregon to New Jersey\u2014defied their own state laws to award marriage licenses to same-sex couples.</span></p> <p><span>San Francisco issued 4,200 licenses until the state\u2019s Supreme Court ordered the city to stop in March, and the mayor of New Paltz in upstate New York faces criminal charges for granting licenses to 25 gay couples.</span></p> <p><span>But even in Massachusetts, the only place to issue state-sanctioned licenses, the future of same-sex marriage remains uncertain.</span></p> <p><span>In February, after the state senate asked the SJC for an advisory opinion on whether a compromise bill allowing civil unions would satisfy the court\u2019s ruling, the justices responded in a 4-3 decision that only marriage would be constitutional.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe dissimilitude between the terms \u2018civil union\u2019 and \u2018civil marriage\u2019 is not innocuous; it is a considered choice of language that reflects a demonstrable assigning of same-sex, largely homosexual, couples to second-class status,\u201d the justices wrote in their majority opinion.</span></p> <p><span>The court\u2019s decision followed the advice of 18 Harvard Law School professors who joined 72 other legal scholars from across the country in January to urge the SJC to reject the civil unions proposal.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI thought it was important, as did a large number of the best constitutional law scholars and legal historians in the country, to weigh in on whether there really is any ambiguity,\u201d said Tyler Professor of Constitutional Law Laurence H. Tribe \u201962, who wrote the friend-of-the-court brief. \u201cI thought it was clear that there wasn\u2019t any.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But Kenan Professor of Government Harvey C. Mansfield \u201953 said the court overstepped its bounds, calling the decision \u201coutrageous and outlandlish.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThey\u2019ve just taken the phrase of equal protection that has no legal connection to marriage and used it as an excuse to impose their own beliefs on the rest of us,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>In March, the Massachusetts State Legislature began debate on an amendment to the state constitution banning gay marriage. Harvard students, including members of the BGLTSA and Harvard College Democrats, rallied outside the State House in opposition.</span></p> <p><span>On March 11, the legislature voted in favor of an amendment limiting marriage to heterosexual couples but establishing civil unions for same-sex couples.</span></p> <p><span>After clearing another vote later in the month, the amendment must now receive the support of a newly-elected legislature in the 2005-2006 session before it is put to a statewide referendum.</span></p> <p><span>Several Cambridge representatives, including Barrios, have been especially vocal in their opposition to the amendment.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cDon\u2019t believe those who tell you that just defining marriage between a man and a woman will not hurt your gay and lesbian friends, your family members, your neighbors and your colleagues, because it will,\u201d Barrios told the legislature on Feb. 12.</span></p> <p><span>State Representative Timothy J. Toomey, who also serves as a city councillor, voted against the proposed amendment and said he hopes it will not pass in the legislature again.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHopefully between now and next year people\u2019s attitudes will shift and be more accepting of everybody having the equal rights to marriage,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile, on the national level, both candidates for president have voiced their opposition to same-sex marriage.</span></p> <p><span>Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., has said he supports civil unions but is against gay marriage and disagrees with the SJC\u2019s ruling.</span></p> <p><span>And President Bush announced on Feb. 24 that he would support a federal constitutional amendment banning same-sex couples from marrying.</span></p> <p><span>Despite the challenges on the horizon, supporters of same-sex marriage said they remain optimistic that the SJC ruling will not be overridden.</span></p> <p><span>Murphy said in an interview earlier this month that he believed \u201cthe world has shifted irrevocably\u201d after the court\u2019s decision, because any measure to ban gay marriage would involve rescinding a right that same-sex couples now have.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhat\u2019s happened now even just a few weeks later is that this is really just now a routine bureaucratic procedure,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>And Margaret C.D. Barusch \u201906, a member of the BGLTSA, expressed a similar sentiment after witnessing the celebration at City Hall.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cOnce people start seeing that all these people are getting married and the sky is not falling, I think it will become a non-issue,\u201d she said.</span></p> <p><span>BGLTSA member Jordan B. Woods \u201906 said he hoped to one day tell his children about the scene at City Hall, and added that the possibility of a ban on same-sex marriage will keep him involved in gay rights advocacy.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe still have to keep on fighting,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though we were able to recognize a historic moment on May 17, if we don\u2019t continue being active and pushing for what we want, then we are not going to get that.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Andrew C.

{"title": "A Silence so Deafening it Kills | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Ronaldo Rauseo-ricupero", "body": "<p><span>This afternoon, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi A. Annan will address the Harvard community as part of the annual meeting of the Harvard Alumni Association. Moments after receiving an honorary degree from the University, Annan will step up to a podium that affords him international attention\u2014a stage from which General George C. Marshall famously announced his plan for the reconstruction of Europe 57 years ago; a stage to which hundreds of Harvard alumni, leaders in society, industry and arts will be turned; a stage on which Annan will be silent.</span></p> <p><span>Annan will be speaking many words, but what he doesn\u2019t say will be more important than what he does. This afternoon, Harvard will witness a textbook example of the all too common rhetorical obfuscations that have allowed the 20th century to become one of the most bloody known to man: the twin policies of denial and appeasement.</span></p> <p><span>Genocide is happening on a massive scale in the Darfur region of Sudan, and the world is pretending not to notice. By accounts updated last week, over 30,000 Darfurians, mainly from the Fur, Masalit, and Zaghawa ethnic groups, have been massacred by the Janjaweed Arab militias, which, thanks to the financial support of the central government in Khartoum, have been ravaging the western region of the country since November. Stirred by President Omar Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir\u2019s incitements of ethnic and racial hatred, Janjaweed fighters were given $100 each, supplied with heavy arms and told that whatever they pillaged would be theirs to keep. They have raped, massacred and destroyed at will. They have stolen international food aid and used it as horse feed, forced nearly 2 million Darfurians to flee their homes and farms (their only source of livelihoods) and caused a destabilizing refugee crisis\u2014so far, nearly 170,000 Darfurians have poured into neighboring Chad.</span></p> <p><span>The Janjaweed militias have also established concentration camps in places like Kialek. That torture camps are sprouting up on Sudanese soil is not surprising given President al-Bashir\u2019s long-established record of inciting hate. This is the same man who oversaw the literal enslavement of Christian Sudanese in the southern part of his country. The progression from hate to slavery to genocide has been quite natural for this regime. In fact, as Suliman Giddo of the Darfur Peace and Development Organization reports, the Janjaweed have of late been surpassing their own record in cruelty: as of April, instead of simply raping and killing the women in Darfurian villages, the Janjaweed now slice the skin off the faces of the women\u2019s corpses so that they are unrecognizable to their families.</span></p> <p><span>And the work of the government-sponsored Janjaweed has been made even easier by the endless delays of the international community\u2014because any kind of intervention has been so long in coming and so easily thwarted, aid organizations must now contend with a rainy season that started last week and has knocked out nearly all transportation access to the most desperate regions. Furthermore, because unchecked looting and ethnic violence prevented any real planting, this aid-hungry area will have no crops this year. This forced starvation will bring about the eradication of the Darfurians with remarkable speed. According to the projections by the United States Agency for International Development, the crude death rate in Sudan by December 2004 will be 6 times the rate considered \u201ccatastrophic\u201d by Doctors Without Borders.</span></p> <p><span>These projections can change, but only if we take action now to help the Darfurians. Last night\u2019s rally and protest was the first step. More than a hundred students rallied on Cambridge Common with leaders from prominent human rights groups, Boston\u2019s black churches, the Ten Point Coalition, the American Anti-Slavery Group and others to remind us that the Darfur genocide cannot be ignored. Many fellow graduates will join me in wearing green ribbons today as a visible symbol of our commitment to stopping the genocide.</span></p> <p><span>However, with nearly 600 people dying per day, the person with the greatest opportunity to end the suffering is Kofi Annan. Today, Annan could unveil plans to increase aid to the Darfur region; to internationalize rail lines to Darfur\u2019s main city and prevent the blockade of humanitarian relief by Janjaweed fighters, as Prof. Eric Reeves of Smith College has proposed; to use U.N. expertise to double or triple the anemically small monitoring team responsible for reporting on \u201chuman rights violations\u201d in a region the size of France, as Kennedy School of Government Professor Samantha Power has advocated; even to remove Sudan from its seat on the United Nations Human Rights Commission, as common sense would dictate. But Annan will do none of these, nor will he recognize the genocide by its proper name: to do so would obligate him to take action. Indeed the fear of confronting \u201cgenocide\u201d in Rwanda was so high in 1994 that we allowed 800,000 people to die before recognizing the situation for what it was. Apparently, the value of not offending the Khartoum government is greater than the moral obligation to stop the massacre of more innocent Darfurians.</span></p> <p><span>This is not to say that the blame rests solely on the U.N. Even though the United States recognized the genocide in the 2002 Sudan Peace Act, aid that Congress promised to Sudan on condition of the resolution of its North-South conflict has not been forthcoming. And despite Bush\u2019s strong statements on the issue during the anniversary of the Rwandan Genocide, two months have passed with no new U.S. action.</span></p> <p><span>Absent committed leadership, we as citizens and as graduates must also take up the banner of preventing another genocide from escalating on our watch. Today, the excuse that we cannot act because we are \u201cjust students\u201d melts away. Our challenge, sadly, is not unique\u2014many classes of Harvard graduates have faced the spectre of mass killings. It is indeed ironic that in his Baccalaureate Address in the Memorial Church on Tuesday, University President Lawrence H. Summers cited the Vietnam War as an example of what can happen \u201cwhen people fail to think things through.\u201d In his watershed book <i>The Best and the Brightest</i>, David L. Halberstam \u201955 showed that it was precisely a group of Harvard affiliates who were the cause of that folly, \u201ca certain breed of men\u2026in their minds they become responsible for the country, but not responsive to it.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>This kind of arrogance is not the only example we could follow. In attendance at this afternoon\u2019s exercises will be the 25th Reunion Class of 1979, the class which displayed such mettle over the issue of South African Divestment. On April 23, 1979, a 700-person demonstration rocked Harvard Yard to protest the University\u2019s investment policy, an action that captured attention around the world and gave hope to South Africans that the world was indeed listening to their plight.</span></p> <p><span>The challenge for the Class of 1979 was apartheid. The challenge for the Class of 2004 is genocide. The body counts are higher, the need for action even more urgent, but the cause never more morally simple: genocide in Darfur must be stopped.</span></p> <p><span>As Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who gave so much hope and support to the Class of 1979, wrote in an e-mail on Monday regarding Secretary-General Annan\u2019s address today, \u201cLet us not say we did not know. We know and we must do something. Let us speak up and speak out against the atrocities in Darfur. Those dying are God\u2019s children. They are our sisters and brothers.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><i>Ronaldo Rauseo-Ricupero \u201904, a Classics concentrator in Leverett House, was editorial chair of The Crimson in 2003.</i></span></p>"}

{"title": "Senior To Sail Troubled Waters | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Like many seniors entering the world of investment banking and consulting, Stephen P. Bosco \u201903-\u201904 will wear a suit to work everyday next year.</span></p> <p><span>He will put in long hours and sleep in cramped quarters\u2014when he gets any rest at all.</span></p> <p><span>But unlike his Brooks Brothers-wearing classmates, Bosco will only have one blue suit in his closet, courtesy of the United States Navy.</span></p> <p><span>Bosco, who took his commission as a Navy ensign in a ceremony held in Tercentenary Theater yesterday, will by the end of this month report aboard the USS Vandegrift (FFG-48), a guided missile frigate based with the Seventh Fleet in Yokosuka, Japan.</span></p> <p><span>After coming to Harvard and joining the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) in a time of peace, Bosco is leaving the University to take a duty posting that could put him in the Persian Gulf and the conflict in Iraq, a potential flare-up in North Korea or even a high seas encounter with pirates.</span></p> <p><span>Yet Bosco says he is undeterred. Not only did he choose the Vandegrift specifically because of the potential that the vessel will see action, he strongly supports the foreign policy that might steer it into harm\u2019s way. Bosco says he is convinced that President Bush\u2019s vision of the United States on the world stage is fundamentally correct.</span></p> <p><span>Bosco, who is from Washington, D.C., and attended St. Albans School, says he knew he wanted to serve in the military coming into Harvard and had even thought about the Naval Academy.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI thought it was important both for my personal development, and as a way of serving my country,\u201d says Bosco, whose father was also in the Navy and currently works as a consultant at the Pentagon.</span></p> <p><span>Even at a school where students regularly load themselves down with extracurricular commitments, Bosco and the other ROTC midshipmen have had to take on some exceptional tasks. During the year he had to wake up early twice weekly for 7:15 a.m. military science courses at MIT\u2014which covered subjects ranging from military bearing to naval engineering\u2014and sometimes he woke up even earlier for physical training (PT) with the marine midshipmen.</span></p> <p><span>He also spent three of his summers training full time for the military. He spent one summer shadowing a mechanic on a destroyer stationed in the Adriatic Sea (\u201cHe could fix anything,\u201d Bosco recalls), and another attached to the intelligence section aboard an amphibious vessel that had just returned from a deployment supporting operations in Afghanistan.</span></p> <p><span>Bosco says that Sept. 11 has tempered the ROTC experience with the knowledge that he and his classmates could be in a real combat situation very soon.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cSept. 11 has impressed upon people the seriousness of the job that they\u2019ve volunteered for,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>However, Bosco is nonchalant about the anti-war feelings that at times have permeated the staunchly liberal Harvard campus.</span></p> <p><span>He says that among students, his ROTC service has been met with curiosity.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI\u2019ve found that almost without fail Harvard students think it\u2019s really great,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>Bosco says that has he been met with hostility only from members of the Faculty, which voted to end Harvard\u2019s on-campus ROTC unit 30 years ago and continues to oppose the program because of the military\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy. And even these have been relatively minor incidents: disparaging comments from a knot of professors as he walked through the Yard in uniform, a debate with a teaching fellow in section.</span></p> <p><span>Neither the anti-war feelings on campus nor his ROTC uniform have dissuaded Bosco from voicing his own opinions, shaped by a brand of conservatism that has left him at odds with liberals, as well as conservatives like Kenan Professor of Government Harvey C. Mansfield \u201953.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI believe the main difference between us is that he is conservative in the sense of being inherently suspicious of change,\u201d Bosco wrote of Mansfield in an e-mail. \u201cHe reveres old institutions for their own sake, and deeply admires proponents of aristocracy such as Edmund Burke. Mainstream American conservatism, in contrast, focuses heavily on liberty and the rights of the individual. Such conservatives venerate Patrick Henry and Thomas Jefferson over proponents of aristocracy like Burke.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>His beliefs have also led him to become an adamant supporter of the Bush administration\u2019s foreign policy.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s not that I love Bush, it\u2019s just that I support his vision of U.S. foreign policy,\u201d he says. \u201cHe understands that the preservation of human rights requires the U.S. to use its power, sometimes in forceful ways.</span></p> <p><span>About a month ago these convictions led Bosco to speak out at a teach-in on Iraq held by the Harvard Initiative for Peace and Justice.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI made a comment where I expressed my opinion that a lot of what had been said in that debate was not accurate,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of talk about American human rights abuses, so I asked them how they justified supporting policies that would\u2019ve allowed Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime to remain in power, given the massive and institutional nature of the human rights abuses that occurred under him.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThey responded pretty negatively,\u201d he adds. \u201cThere was sort of an attempt to shout me down as I was speaking.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Bosco\u2019s strong views on foreign policy extend beyond his support of the Bush administration. He spent last year in Taiwan, working with the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy\u2014an NGO that works to promote democracy in Asia\u2014and last summer interned in the war games section at National Defense University, helping to create crisis scenarios.</span></p> <p><span>He has also authored two articles for the Harvard Political Review on international affairs, and in December 2002 wrote an op-ed for The Crimson in support of U.S. military action in Iraq.</span></p> <p><span>But now Bosco will be the proverbial tip of the spear, carrying out the policies he has so vocally supported in a world that has become increasingly dangerous.</span></p> <p><span>Indeed, the Vandegrift is a modern vessel, built during the Cold War and armed with missiles, torpedoes and a 76 mm gun. But one of Bosco\u2019s jobs next year might be more in the tradition of John Paul Jones: boarding a ship and searching compartment after compartment for terrorists or contraband.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cTypically there are indications that it\u2019s going to be really hostile,\u201d he says of the potential scenario. \u201cThen there have been times when you never know what the reception is going to be like.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff writer Christopher M.

{"title": "West Denial Virus | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>CAIRO, EGYPT\u2014I was delighted to learn, within minutes of landing in Cairo, that Egypt has a sense of humor as loud and unconventional as my own. Humor, more than anything, has been my saving grace in Egypt, even as I navigate its crowded streets in the nervous anonymity of an analphabetic foreigner. My relationship with this country has been, from day one, founded on the fact that I find Egypt funny\u2014and Egypt finds me funny.</span></p> <p><span>First of all, there is much fun to be had in Middle Eastern airports. Okay, okay, allow me to rephrase: some of my funniest experiences have centered around my travels to, from and around the region. From negotiating for my visa stamps in abysmal French and refusing marriage proposals from Egypt Air flight attendants\u2014note: the correct response to such a proposal is not \u201cBut you\u2019re married!\u201d because the response will invariably be \u201cBut in our law, men can have two wives!\u201d\u2014to watching Nasser-era Egyptian films and skirting eager cab drivers, airports have offered me hours on hours of good fun.</span></p> <p><span>Here\u2019s an example: The middle-aged assistant in the business class lounge at the Cairo airport (I arrived there through a travel agent fluke, a story for another day) showed me the various lounge rooms with a mischievous smirk: \u201cThis is the English lounge: it\u2019s cold and dark, like the English! This is the American lounge: it\u2019s big and bright, like Americans! This is the French lounge: there is no service here!\u201d Though it\u2019s illegal\u2014you will find no books of \u201cMubaraq-isms\u201d here\u2014Egyptians are even known to poke subtle fun at their own government, although they really love to tease George Bush.</span></p> <p><span>What will strike most visitors to Egypt\u2014torn between urgent and exaggerated preservation of tradition and the promise of growth, the schizophrenia of globalization\u2014are Egypt\u2019s glaring contradictions and ironies. It is not uncommon to walk through bazaars and see women covered from head to toe in black, veiled except for their eyes, rifling through gargantuan vats of skimpy thong underwear. It is perfectly acceptable, even normal, for male soldiers to hold hands and kiss one another on the street, machine guns slung casually by their sides. At the same time, though, wives follow their husbands in the street and women are not supposed to make eye contact with men. A skirt that falls just below the knee will draw whistles and disapproving stares from across the Nile, but Britney Spears and Kelis dominate even the Egyptian music video channels. These ironies struck me as simultaneously amusing and sad.</span></p> <p><span>And if you thought Harvard was choked by its own bureaucracy, I suggest trying to order a chocolate milkshake and french fries at your typical Cairene Hardee\u2019s (look, even the most cultured of us crack under the pressure of daily falafel and pita, so give me a break). One man takes your order while another stands and gapes, a third grabs a cup, a fourth corrects him, a fifth pours the shake before a sixth puts on the cap while a seventh fumbles with the register and barks orders to an eighth who will fetch your shake\u2026and they still will have forgotten your french fries. Oh, and when you get your change, don\u2019t be shocked if in place of small change you are gifted with individually wrapped pieces of gum. You just can\u2019t beat a barter economy, or minty-fresh breath.</span></p> <p><span>I think the restrictions of Cairo have done nothing but exacerbate my restlessness and stoke my exhibitionist urges. I have belted Bob Marley while careening through the Sahara in an ancient Humvee, friends at my side, to a campsite in the white desert. I have reclaimed my independence atop a desert ridge, ripping off my shirt and claiming the land for myself\u2014\u201cOperation O\u2019Brien Freedom,\u201d I called it. Then I scampered back down to find our Bedouin guides laughing at my idiocy. I\u2019d left my only water bottle at the top of the hill.</span></p> <p><span>I have danced on a boat in the Nile, in Cairene nightclubs and in pain when I banged my head on the door of the bus to the university where I am studying.</span></p> <p><span>I have been laughed at by young and old: young boys on the street trying to sell me rolls of toilet paper and by my ancient Arabic teacher, who calls me amira (\u201cprincess\u201d) because I am always complaining about the air conditioning. I have been laughed at by the men in the Egyptian travel agency, who had me repeat Arabic phrases but wouldn\u2019t tell me what they meant. I have been laughed at by the guard in front of my dorm when I flinched at his casual toss of his semi-automatic. And though I might have been cold, embarrassed or scared, I laughed back.</span></p> <p><span>When I am not dancing or probing the ends of the earth to stake out land for my Irish countrymen, I have sought stability in subtle reminders of normalcy and my routine at home. The people at the local coffee shop already know me, and they are ready to prepare my double-shot cappuccino when I stumble in, grouchy and disappointed by the extent of my addiction, every morning at 8:15.</span></p> <p><span>Following a summer spent entirely at home, and then a hectic school year, my time so far as a student, tourist and one-woman show in Egypt has been one of the most amazing and rewarding experiences of my life. Along with the laughter, there have been painful reminders of economic discrepancies\u2014incomplete, rundown houses with state-of-the-art satellite dishes trumpeting their poverty\u2014and moments of utter discomfort (other than sunburns and mosquito bites) when we encounter local hostility.</span></p> <p><span>But the clash of cultures has been more of a slow series of culture shocks (both pleasant and unpleasant), and where a lapse in language comprehension would make things difficult, honest, if surprising, efforts at mutual understanding have compensated. After all, as I played peek-a-boo with the giggling baby girl on the seat in front of me en route from New York, I realized there are two acts that can transcend language and cultural gaps: laughter and frantic hand gestures indicating missing french fries.</span></p> <p><span><i>Rebecca D.

{"title": "Review: Fahrenheit 9/11 | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The Manhattan preview of <i>Fahrenheit 9/11</i> last week felt more like the opening of some hip eatery than that of a subversive political documentary that takes a full two hours to criticize the president. But then again, everything in New York is a little dressier. Hundreds of creatively coiffed and pierced twenty-somethings, tempered by a strong showing of Upper West Side middle-aged couples (read: my parents) queued up to see director and gadfly Michael Moore\u2019s most controversial film to date. Oh and then there were a few others: the groups carrying signs and enlisting moviegoers to help protest the Republican National Convention in August; the well-spoken beggar who dispassionately argued his case to theater patrons (\u201cMy, you look nice tonight. I don\u2019t drink or do drugs, but I do need some money\u201d); and lastly two blonde men in pastel polo walking by. With a sneer, one said to the other, \u201cYou don\u2019t believe Michael Moore\u2019s version of America, do you?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>I\u2019ll never know how the other fellow answered. But after seeing the film, most moviegoers will find it hard not to believe Moore\u2019s version of America, or at least some part of it. What makes <i>Fahrenheit</i> so unique is not the message\u2014who isn\u2019t Bush-bashing, or at least criticizing the war in Iraq, these days?\u2014but the passionate, brilliant craftsmanship that gets it across. Far, far across. Moore cuts deftly from hilarity to sobriety, from presenting dry onscreen evidence, often circled or pointed at with arrows, to composing artistic montages backed by perfectly-chosen music. Sometimes, he just lets the footage speak for itself.</span></p> <p><span>It\u2019s damn impressive footage, of almost four years\u2019 worth of terrorism, war and misgovernance. And unlike the patrons at the New York preview, many of whom were born with Democratic Party membership in one hand and a silver spoon in the other, Moore doesn\u2019t touch armchair liberalism with a ten foot pole. His leftism comes from, and on behalf of, working class middle America, an America he clearly loves. His dissent is an act of patriotism, and its fierceness takes one\u2019s breath away.</span></p> <p><span>Moore\u2019s work is not just a look at the current dismal situation at home and abroad: throughout the film, he returns time and time again to a much broader story, that of the corrupting influence of money on American society. This has the potential to discomfit some moviegoers who think nothing of throwing 10 bucks away on a ticket (and an extra five on a latte and scone if it\u2019s one of those \u201cartsy\u201d theaters).  The film\u2019s endless exposing of financial ties between the Bush family and the Saudi elite is easy to dismiss as mere \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d hoopla\u2014and admittedly, some of it is confusing and can seem a bit overblown. But Moore is no conspiracy junkie. What he\u2019s pointing out here is the less-than-paranoid observation that our president might be at least as interested in his own money as in any higher calling\u2014and, <i>Fahrenheit</i> tells us, the same goes for a lot of corporations.  This case is accompanied by brutal war footage and stark images of poverty at home, showing us the human toll taken by the self-interested actions of bigwigs.</span></p> <p><span>Moore proves himself an expert at warming up his audience with pointed laughter before socking them with this serious message, just as he did in <i>Bowling for Columbine</i>, his 2002 documentary on violence and American culture. Much of <i>Fahrenheit</i>\u2019s humor arises from a barrage of shots of President Bush yachting, fishing and talking eagerly about his dog\u2019s dirt-burrowing habits, plus a ready supply of verbal gaffes\u2014\u201cworkin\u2019 on some things\u201d is how the president describes one afternoon\u2019s agenda to a reporter. Moore also throws in the occasional dig at a celebrity, such as a clip of Britney Spears chewing gum, twisting a strand of hair around her head and avowing her faith in \u201cour president.\u201d Through these shots Moore relaxes his audience while telling us that a culture of unwavering support might be slightly, like, stupid.</span></p> <p><span>But the film never masquerades as a comedy; the serious moments are so constant that even the most impervious viewer is guaranteed to shake his or her head at least a few times. In New York, head shakes were audible gasps\u2014first, in the movie\u2019s earliest minutes, for the numerous black House representatives who stood up to protest the 2000 election\u2019s results in Congress but were not allowed to lodge their objections because they lacked the support of a single senator. This disquieting spectacle is something the cable news networks seemed to miss. And Moore\u2019s footage of the astonishing minutes after the attack on the World Trade Center, when President Bush continued reading a book entitled <i>My Pet Goat</i> to elementary students with a petrified look on his face, has already begun seeping into the national consciousness.</span></p> <p><span>Other, similar \u201cwhy didn\u2019t I know this?\u201d moments are far too numerous to recount, but they leave the viewer positively starving for more information. Why didn\u2019t we ever see the panicked look on Iraqi faces when they saw the rubble after American bombs dropped? Why didn\u2019t we ever see footage of injured soldiers, wincing in pain over amputated limbs, or the hundreds of flag-draped coffins? Why didn\u2019t we ever get replays of Condoleeza Rice and Colin Powell assuring us that Saddam Hussein was not a threat just a year or two before we invaded Iraq? Meanwhile, Moore shows us what we do see\u2014news anchors vowing blindly to support the troops\u2014as his justification for presenting information the way he does. He\u2019s not trying to give us a balanced piece of journalism. He\u2019s telling us the other side of the story.</span></p> <p><span>Moore also displays a talent for catching poignant moments on film himself: the Marine recruiter handing his card to a ninth grader, the boy saying he wishes he was able to go to college without the fear of dying in the process, the military mom reading her son\u2019s last letter, in which he criticizes the Bush administration. Sometimes Moore creates the moments, taking to the streets to get Congresspeople to enlist their children in the Army, exposing the hypocrisy of lawmakers who send other people\u2019s children to die without wanting to sacrifice their own.</span></p> <p><span>And for those skeptics in the audience, <i>Fahrenheit</i> brings in the experts: a senator/psychologist discusses the culture of fear created by the color-coded security alerts, a former FBI agent bemoans how easily the Bin Laden family was allowed to flee the country after September 11. These official-seeming people lend comfort to those who can\u2019t take the emotion, the bloody Iraqi bodies, as evidence.</span></p> <p><span><i>Fahrenheit</i>\u2019s two hours will make one\u2019s head spin\u2014but is it all liberal spin, as the pastel-clad passerby at the New York theater would have us believe? Moore himself has said that he sees his film as more op-ed than documentary. But in ways that a piece of opinion writing cannot, this movie takes traditional liberal complaints and makes them visceral and stunning. He makes us laugh, but mostly he makes us squirm.</span></p> <p><span>Moore has thrown in something for everyone in his audience, it seems. Those unsure about his indictment of capitalism\u2014undoubtedly a tough claim to swallow for a world that subsists on it\u2014will still most likely come out with more doubt about the war effort than they had walking in. On the other side of things, the bourgeois leftist who complained about the war in a Gap sweatshirt might go home and think about the growing wealth gap. As the already-endless debate over the movie has proven, though, no one will walk out of the film without strong feelings one way or the other.</span></p> <p><span>Moore made this film like a man possessed by a vision. But even if his audience calls him crazy, there\u2019s more than a little method to his madness.</span></p> <p><span><b></b></span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014SARAH M. SELTZER</i></span></p>"}
{"title": "Clinton's 'Life' Tinted Crimson | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Timothy J. Mcginn", "body": "<p><span>There are places Bill Clinton remembers in <i>My Life</i>\u2014just not too well, according to Kennedy School of Government professor and Dunster House Master Roger B. Porter, who alleges that the former president fabricated a damning conversation between the two of them in his newly published memoir.</span></p> <p><span>Recalling the impetus for his 1992 presidential campaign, Clinton writes that he was initially ambivalent towards seeking the office, but says that a call from Porter \u201cshowed what was wrong with [then-President George H. W. Bush\u2019s] administration.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>According to Clinton\u2019s book, Porter\u2014then Bush\u2019s Economic and Domestic Policy Adviser\u2014said that while other potential Democratic opponents could be undermined through weaknesses grounded in their politics, the Arkansas governor was \u201cdifferent.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHere\u2019s how Washington works,\u201d Clinton quotes Porter as saying. \u201cThe press has to have somebody and we\u2019re going to give them you...We\u2019ll spend whatever we have to spend to get whoever we have to get to say whatever they have to say to take you out. And we\u2019ll do it early.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But the only conversation Porter can recall the two having came during President Bush\u2019s 1989 Education Summit with the Governors, at which he joked with Clinton about how he ought to run for president in much the same fashion as Ronald Reagan\u2014as a Republican.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe never had any conversation as he has described in his book,\u201d Porter said last night. \u201cYou don\u2019t remember every conversation in life, but I would certainly remember a conversation like that.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Porter pointed to \u201ctell-tale\u201d signals within the purported dialogue as confirming his version of the account, singling out the use of the word \u201ccrap.\u201d Clinton wrote that Porter broke off a policy conversation with \u201cCut the crap, Governor,\u201d before the alleged threats.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s not the way I talk,\u201d Porter said, \u201cand anybody who\u2019s been around me knows that\u2019s not the way I talk.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Porter also dismissed claims that anyone in George H.W. Bush\u2019s administration would make such a call, stating that discussions of smearing Clinton never took place during any of the meetings he attended or was aware of during his time at the White House.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThat was not President Bush\u2019s style or that of those who worked for him,\u201d Porter said.</span></p> <p><span>Clinton\u2019s allegations initially surfaced during his first term in office, when Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward learned of the account.</span></p> <p><span>According to the White House Bulletin on June 23, 2004, provided by Porter to The Crimson, Woodward stated that he did not think Clinton\u2019s assertion that it was Porter who made the threat was credible enough to be included in his 1994 book The Agenda, which he was then working on.</span></p> <p><span>\u201c[It] sounds like someone from the Sopranos,\u201d Woodward told the Bulletin. \u201cIt\u2019s an apocryphal story.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>And while Porter agreed that that is all Clinton\u2019s version of the events amounts to, he was not quite so quick to dismiss its effects.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIn the prologue to his memoir [Clinton] talks about one of the desires of his youth was someday to write a great book,\u201d Porter said. \u201cHe concludes with his evaluation: \u2018As for the great book, who knows?  It sure is a good story.\u2019  Good stories, however, are better if they are grounded in facts.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Despite what he perceives as his smearing, Porter said that the incident will not taint discussions of Clinton in his popular government course, \u201cThe American Presidency.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cNo, it won\u2019t affect my treatment of President Clinton, but I am disappointed in him,\u201d Porter said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhy he feels the need to just make stuff up escapes me,\u201d he added.</span></p> <p><span>Porter was not the only current Harvard faculty member to earn mention in Clinton\u2019s book.</span></p> <p><span>Kennedy School of Government professor David Gergen is described as urging Clinton to disclose documents about the Whitewater real estate scandal\u2014advice which the former president, to his eventual chagrin, decided against.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI was particularly gratified that he has recognized it could have saved him a very long and bruising confrontation and we never would have heard from Ken Starr or any of the other controversy,\u201d Gergen told The Crimson yesterday.</span></p> <p><span>Two former Secretaries of the Treasury\u2014University President Lawrence H. Summers and his Treasury predecessor Robert E. Rubin \u201960, currently a member of the Harvard Corporation\u2014each garnered praise for their service on his Cabinet.</span></p> <p><span>But while Clinton had uniformly kind words for Summers, he cited a few shortcomings in the range of his knowledge, most notably in the world of entertainment.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cLarry Summers, who knew everything about economics but little about popular culture, came into the Oval Office one day and remarked that he\u2019d just had a meeting on debt relief with \u2018some guy named Bono\u2014just one name\u2014dressed in jeans, a T-shirt, and big sunglasses,\u2019\u201d Clinton writes in the book.</span></p> <p><span>According to Clinton, Summers nevertheless had nothing but praise for the man he didn\u2019t know was the lead singer of U2.</span></p> <p><span>\u201c\u2018He came to see me about debt relief, and he knows what he\u2019s talking about,\u2019\u201d Clinton quotes Summers as saying about Bono.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI didn\u2019t know Bono,\u201d Summers admitted yesterday through a spokesperson. \u201cI do now and my kids really love going backstage.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff writer Timothy J.

{"title": "Harvard May Lose $1.5M in Gov't Aid | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Harvard may find itself near the top of yet another ranking of universities as soon as this fall\u2014but for once, the University does not aspire to be heading the list.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard could lose nearly $1.5 million in federal student-aid programs when the Higher Education Act is reauthorized by Congress, potentially making it one of the big losers in federal funding, according to a study in the June 4 edition of The Chronicle of Higher Education.</span></p> <p><span>According to the study, if the bill currently being considered by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce were to become law, Harvard would rank 11th in greatest losses in Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (SEOGs) among American post-secondary institutions, as it faces $844,000 in annual cuts. Harvard could also see a projected decline of $629,000 annually in Perkins loans\u2014losses that would be eclipsed only by those suffered by three other universities.</span></p> <p><span>SEOGs and the Perkins Loan Program, along with the Work Study Program, are the elements of the Higher Education Act that comprise campus-based aid. Unlike many other scholarships, campus-based aid is given to institutions, rather than directly to individual students, said Director of Financial Aid Sally C. Donahue. The institution then chooses how to allocate those funds to students, within the context of federal guidelines.</span></p> <p><span>Donahue said Harvard would feel the impact in the loss of such funds, despite the relatively large amount of total financial aid awarded. In 2002-2003, Harvard gave students $115 million in total federal aid and an additional $171 million in institutional support, Donahue said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe can\u2019t just throw money in from somewhere else, so a change in the law would entail sacrifice at some level,\u201d she said. \u201cThere might be a slight increase in the self-help level of low-income students.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But Donahue said the potential loss in funding would not alter Harvard\u2019s commitment to need-blind admissions.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe\u2019re very fortunate here at Harvard in that we have a very generous alumni population that believes in our ability to continue to meet the full need of all of our students,\u201d Donahue said.</span></p> <p><span>According to Harvard Director of Federal Relations Suzanne L. Day, the Higher Education Act needs to be reauthorized every five to six years under congressional statute and is scheduled to expire on October 1. Day said the law will likely not be renewed this year because of a backlogged legislative agenda, but that Congress will almost certainly pass an appropriations provision extending the current financial aid levels until the Higher Education Act is renewed.</span></p> <p><span>Under current law, campus-based aid is awarded according to two criteria, including the demographics of the student body and a base guarantee that ensures that institutions will receive a certain minimum percentage of campus-based aid funding. That minimum is set when the institution first applies to receive federal funding.</span></p> <p><span>But two prominent members of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce\u2014Committee Chair Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, and Higher Education Subcommittee Chair Rep. Howard P. \u201cBuck\u201d McKeon, R-Calif.\u2014have introduced H.R. 4283 to the full committee for deliberation. For the first time since the law\u2019s inception in 1965, the bill proposes the elimination of the base guarantee.</span></p> <p><span>Day said such a move would likely be supported by the Bush administration and others that believe that the base guarantee locks the government into giving institutions aid money based on past needs, rather than based upon present needs.</span></p> <p><span>Donahue said Harvard would lose out under such a change because it has received money under the Higher Education Act since the 1970s and thus has a base guarantee that allows Harvard to obtain a disproportionately large level of funding.</span></p> <p><span>Day said some are concerned that without the base guarantee, the funding accorded to schools will be too volatile with yearly demographic shifts in the student body.</span></p> <p><span>But Day added that Senate leaders have not publicly endorsed such a switch, which could mean that the base guarantee might not be eliminated.</span></p> <p><span>Additionally, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy \u201954-\u201956, D-Mass., the ranking member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, and Sen. Judd Gregg, R-NH, the committee chair, both oppose redistributing federal aid, said Kennedy spokesperson Jim Manley.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe try to advise everyone on campus that these proposals are potential options.

{"title": "London Lanes | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>LONDON\u2014If you happen to be in London for the summer, and you\u2019re waiting for the No. 49 bus stop at Shepherd\u2019s Bush Green past midnight, you\u2019ll see how hard it is to understand, much less summarize, a city like this in the space of an essay. In between lovely greens, brooding men threaten another with knives; drunken people stagger around looking for a light; forlorn homeless wander past into the dark of the park; someone breaks a car window; friends laugh and urinate on storefronts; the police pass, looking for someone, maybe you.</span></p> <p><span>And then, when things can\u2019t get any more dodgy (as they say), a bright face under dripping hair offers directions (oh, the No. 49 bus doesn\u2019t run at night) and asks questions (there\u2019s a lot of crime in New York too, ain\u2019t there) in a cockney accent, not the sort known to be particularly chatty with out-of-towners. She reveals: \u201cThere\u2019s that London [gesturing perhaps towards Buckingham Palace and Trafalgar Square] but there\u2019s also this London [nodding at the drunk in the shadows]. And after 11, there\u2019s another city entirely.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Waiting for that legendary red double decker bus is part of a revelatory experience, a continual revision of what a place is, a kind of decoder ring for the city\u2019s century-old myth. That a city like London is, to use Benjamin Disraeli\u2019s phrase, one of \u201ctwo nations\u201d is not surprising, but it\u2019s not enough to see it through A Clockwork Orange\u2019s blood-colored lens, or even in Dickens\u2019 soot-tinged ink. Once, his dirty, patchwork metropolis of chimney sweeps and scofflaws was no more impressive to me than the broad, imperial tones of a history textbook or a Lord Soandso (chancellor, historian, poet, collector of exotic birds) majestically painting the background of the Imperial City, with its thatch roofs, flying buttresses, Big Ben, the golden Houses of Parliament.</span></p> <p><span>My first visits here, on holiday (not vacation!) were no less mythic than these imagined landscapes. I spent my time strolling around the secretive gardens of Westminster, pressing my camera against the iron of Buckingham Palace, throwing my lanky frame around an exorbitant mega-disco, spinning dumbly at the continuous vroom of oblivious Ferraris. A few years ago, staring despondently across Kensington Gardens through a late spring haze, I found myself looking into the far reaches of the old, overgrown empire\u2014fertile Punjab farms, the plains of Kenya, the plantations of Virginia. The finished postcard canvas was cold and foreboding: Ferraris and investment banks and high manners alongside Wordsworth\u2019s thronged alleys; abject poverty beside obscene wealth is a good place to write history or poetry but not much of a place to live.</span></p> <p><span>But this is a different time, and it\u2019s a different place, and I\u2019m a different person. It\u2019s not that I\u2019ve matured in any way\u2014no, lately I feel the opposite: it\u2019s that I\u2019m living in London, staying here, planting some roots, tenuous though they may be. The person you are when living somewhere, strolling around damp street corners and lazying around Regents Park and getting dressed for a newspaper job is not the person you are when you\u2019re on holiday, pushing through queues and wax museums and hustling to get to the play on time, map flapping in the wind like a cape as you barrel down Picadilly Circus.</span></p> <p><span>It\u2019s common travel lit philosophy that one of the joys of journeying is the ability to discover and even reinvent yourself. That may be, but when you\u2019re on holiday, with family or friends, counting the days before you\u2019ll have to return to the airport, the only self-reflection you get is in store windows or in the panes of glass overlooking the runway. It\u2019s hard to feel like a new, adventurous person when you find yourself spending a good deal of time riding airport conveyor belts to the next terminal, and the next. And to me that\u2019s what traveling on a regimented holiday feels like\u2014terminal, static, stuck. Life seems to go on hold as soon as you go on holiday, your mouth ajar, thumb perpetually stuck in the travel guide.</span></p> <p><span>Strange as it is, only when I\u2019m staying somewhere for a while, working and relaxing and living there, and not merely passing through, do I feel any sense of movement. It\u2019s the natural movement of the place you\u2019re in, the city that, like every city, is always changing. And just as when you\u2019re moving on the subway, looking out the window of the car on your way to work, the view is less of a postcard portrait than an overwhelming blur. Of course Dr. Johnson was right: \u201cIt is not in the showy evolutions of buildings, but in the multiplicity of human habitations which are crowded together, that the wonderful immensity of London consists.\u201d The old, cold illusion of London, of its foreboding palaces and city estates and dispassionate people gives way to a mess of place names, curious tunnels, galleries of exciting posters for plays and films, tired faces of all colors speaking over three hundred languages.</span></p> <p><span>The foreign lilts and signs here are as diverse as the delightful scents that spill out of Edgware Road\u2019s fruity shishas, the hash pipes of Notting Hill, the tandooris of Tower Hamlet, the boerewor shops of Southfields. The world to which London extended itself for centuries has flocked to London. In 1888, Henry James wrote that \u201cIt is a real stroke of luck for a particular country that the capital of the human race happens to be British. Surely every other people would have it theirs if they could.\u201d The British still have it, except now more than ever, \u201cBritish\u201d doesn\u2019t just mean English.</span></p> <p><span>This 21st century melting pot not only confounds attempts to condense London\u2014more than any other city I\u2019ve lived in\u2014into a guidebook, or capture it in a postcard; it makes London difficult to grasp for even Londoners. My own re-evaluation of London comes at a time when many British seem to be doing the same thing with their country. For the past half-century, the country has been coping with\u2014and reveling in\u2014the realization that it is no longer a sceptre\u2019d isle onto itself, nor, in the age of the European Union, can it ever be.</span></p> <p><span>But long after the demise of this naval power, navel gazing has also led to increasing spates of exceptionalism. The fall of Labour in the recent local and European elections was as much a sign of dissatisfaction over the Iraq war, largely seen as a blow to European cooperativeness, as it was a sign of a yearning for independence. Calls for \u201cdemocracy over bureaucracy\u201d are as old as the Magna Carta, and they continue now in the form of the rising U.K. Independence Party, which, like the Tories, is quite happy with the Pound and doesn\u2019t want to be bossed around by countries that use the Euro, thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span>I\u2019m not sure what it means to be \u201cBritish\u201d any more than did, for instance, my cabdriver the other night. \u201cI dunno,\u201d he said. \u201cThe red-and-white flags always come out around the Euro.\u201d Unlike the currency of the same name, the ongoing Euro soccer\u2014er, football\u2014tournament draws out the best (and, as evidenced by the occasional riot, the worst) national excitement the country has to offer. That enthusiasm doesn\u2019t jibe with the British reputation for reserve and the quietude of its country lanes. It\u2019s getting harder these days to make such stereotypic claims about this increasingly multicultural country, where, people of every color and ethnicity are likely to cheer for David Beckham or Wayne Rooney at their local pub (provided their team is knocked out of competition first).</span></p> <p><span>I\u2019m reading a book about London now, one that certainly inspired some of this incomplete \u201cpostcard,\u201d but I\u2019m not much inclined to finish it anymore than I\u2019m anxious to start Peter Ackroyd\u2019s biblical \u201cbiography\u201d of London. All I really need is my small map with hundreds of streets listed on it, a sort of basic table of contents to the ur-text, the city itself, \u201cthe most complete compendium of the world,\u201d as James called London.</span></p> <p><span>Joyce reportedly once claimed that if Dublin ever went up in flames, his Ulysses would be enough to rebuild it, a boast made credible I think by the very difficulty of that book, by the fact that while many start, few finish that thing, and that those who have insist they should probably give it at least another go before talking about it. Cities are that way too: no matter what James says, they can\u2019t be \u201ccompleted\u201d by readers or writers, and even if they could by some feat, you\u2019d be hard pressed to recount the plot line. I\u2019ve always loved the end of Poe\u2019s short story \u201cThe Man of the Crowd,\u201d in which the narrator follows a mysterious chap through the bustling, contradictory streets of London: \u201cit does not permit itself to be read.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Without any sort of Ulysses to ensure its recovery, London did go up in flames, twice: the Great Fire in 1666 and the blitz of World War II each destroyed most of the city; rebuilding hasn\u2019t stopped since. In the past few weeks I\u2019ve been doing some rebuilding of my own version of London, and, as these things go, London\u2019s been doing some rebuilding of me. But I won\u2019t finish, can\u2019t. There\u2019s too much complexity here, too much living to do.</span></p> <p><span><i>Alexander L.

Summers recently wrote to Secretary of State Colin Powell and Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Tom Ridge \u201967 to decry Bush administration policies that have led to declining international enrollments.</span></p> <p><span>Though the Nobelists expressed serious reservations about Bush\u2019s policies, some said they had precedent in previous administrations, singling out the late Ronald Reagan for particular criticism.</span></p> <p><span>Hubel recalled attending the 1981 Nobel ceremony in Stockholm along with four or five other American winners, including Gade University Professor emeritus Nicolaas Bloembergen, who won in physics that year and who also signed this week\u2019s endorsement letter. Hubel said that the American contingent was the only one that had not received congratulations from their head of state, then Reagan, at the time of the ceremony.</span></p> <p><span>Herschbach leveled similar charges, recounting an incident in which he said the former president had pressured members of a committee to withhold support of science education.</span></p> <p><span>The scientists said they had no specific goals in mind when signing the letter, other than publicly standing behind Kerry\u2019s recent promises to support science and lift restrictions on federal funds for stem cell research.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI don\u2019t think that because people happen to be Nobel laureates that they have any more political wisdom than other citizens,\u201d Herschbach said. \u201cAnd yet you do feel that you have the responsibility to speak out when you have the opportunity to do so.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In addition to Bloembergen, Hubel, Herschbach, Lipscomb and Benacerraf, the Harvard signers included Professor of Surgery emeritus Joseph E.

{"title": "Former HBS Prof Blasts Bush | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>As the race for the White House heats up and the nation\u2019s left-leaning heads come together to unearth potential skeletons in President Bush\u2019s closet, one line in his resume has avoided major scrutiny: the time Bush spent just across the Charles River, earning an MBA at the Harvard Business School (HBS) in the 1970s. Now, as some fervently question the commander-in-chief\u2019s performance in the Texas National Guard decades ago and more current-minded politicos take aim at the events surrounding Sept. 11, 2001 and the invasion of Iraq, one former HBS professor is doing his best to publicize his recollections of what he calls a sarcastic, mediocre student who went on to lead the United States.</span></p> <p><span>Yoshihiro Tsurumi, an avowed opponent of Bush\u2019s current views and policies who was a visiting associate professor of international business at HBS between 1972 and 1976, said Bush was among 85 students he taught one year in a required first-year course. In the class on \u201cEnvironment Analysis for Management,\u201d incorporating elements of macroeconomics, industrial policy and international business, Tsurumi said students discussed and debated case studies for 90 minutes several times a week.</span></p> <p><span>Tsurumi\u2014now a professor of international business at Baruch College in the City University of New York\u2014said he remembers the future president as scoring in the bottom 10 percent of students in the class.</span></p> <p><span>Thirty years after teaching the class, Tsurumi said the twenty-something Bush\u2019s statements and behavior\u2014\u201calways very shallow\u201d\u2014still stand out in his mind.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhenever [Bush] just bumped into me, he had some flippant statement to make,\u201d said Tsurumi when reached at his home in Scarsdale, N.Y. \u201cThe comments he made were revealing of his prejudice.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The White House did not reply to requests for comment on Bush\u2019s time at HBS.</span></p> <p><span>Tsurumi said he particularly recalls Bush\u2019s right-wing extremism at the time, which he said was reflected in off-hand comments equating the New Deal of the 1930s with socialism and the corporation-regulating Securities and Exchange Commission with \u201can enemy of capitalism.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI vividly remember that he made a comment saying that people are poor because they\u2019re lazy,\u201d Tsurumi said.</span></p> <p><span>Tsurumi also said Bush displayed a sense of arrogance about his prominent family, including his father, former U.S. President George H.W. Bush.</span></p> <p><span>\u201c[George W. Bush] didn\u2019t stand out as the most promising student, but...he made it sure we understood how well he was connected,\u201d Tsurumi said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t bashful about how he was being pushed upward by Dad\u2019s connections.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Tsurumi said that the younger Bush boasted that his father\u2019s political string-pulling had gotten him to the top of the waiting list for the Texas National Guard instead of serving in Vietnam. When other students were frantically scrambling for summer jobs, Tsurumi said, Bush explained that he was planning instead for a visit to his father in Beijing, where the senior Bush was serving at the time as the special U.S. envoy to China.</span></p> <p><span>In addition, Tsurumi is still sore about what he recalls as Bush\u2019s slight to his cinematic taste. When he arranged for students to view the film of John Steinbeck\u2019s <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i> during their study of the Great Depression, Tsurumi said, Bush derided the film as \u201ccorny.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>At the time, Tsurumi said his worries about his student extended no further than the boardroom.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAll Harvard Business School students want to become president of a company one day,\u201d Tsurumi said. \u201cI remember saying, if you become president of a company some day, may God help your customers and employees.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>When he discovered that his former pupil was vying for the presidency in 2000, Tsurumi said he tried to inform the public about his experience with the then-Texas governor at HBS\u2014but got few results beyond hate mail.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cLast election time, if you recall, the American mass media did a shameful job of vetting [the presidential candidates],\u201d Tsurumi said.</span></p> <p><span>As another November approaches, Tsurumi is trying again to air his criticisms of the man he once taught and his actions as president.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis time it seems to be getting around a bit more widely,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter three years of dismal record, people seem more inclined to believe that all his failed leadership was apparent during the Harvard Business School years.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In a July 2 speech to the Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan in Tokyo, Tsurumi repeated the broadside he has launched repeatedly in the past.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI always remember two groups of students,\u201d Tsurumi said then, according to published reports. \u201cOne is the really good students, not only intelligent, but with leadership qualities, courage. The other is the total opposite, unfortunately to which George belonged.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff writer Simon W.

{"title": "Team Pittsburgh's Big Secret | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>PITTSBURGH\u2014At 12:30 a.m. on July 7, the day Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., announced his choice of Sen John R. Edwards, D-N.C., as running mate, I arrived at the Pittsburgh airport to relieve Reggie from the exciting but monotonous job of babysitting John Kerry\u2019s 757.  I walked into the terminal expecting to find Reggie, who was on my advance team, but instead found myself staring into the lens of an ABC news camera. I headed back out, trying to look inconspicuous in my suit and realized that I had a big Kerry sticker on my backpack. I peeled it off and threw it away, as if the cameraperson had not already noticed.</span></p> <p><span>I called Reggie, who had been at the airport since the early afternoon, and he said I should walk along the sidewalk to find him. A minute later I heard a whistle to my left and turned. A car door opened and smoke poured out. He strained to step out and I happened to look across the fence that surrounds the tarmac. The campaign\u2019s charter plane seemed very close in the dark. Reggie pointed out that a good part of the forward fuselage above the windows was covered in brown paper.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cSee that,\u201d he said, \u201cyou better hope it doesn\u2019t rain.\u201d I suddenly realized that my suspicions regarding this late night mission had been completely wrong. I had suspected that I was at the airport to meet the running mate\u2019s plane. Though the campaign had kept the secret of the announcement from everyone including the advance team, we were all suspicious and I could think of no other reason to wait around the airport all night. But suddenly it was real. I couldn\u2019t believe this was happening.</span></p> <p><span>All I knew at the time was that I had to make sure rabid scoop-hungry journalists could not could not jump the fence and tear the paper enough to see what was beneath it. The night passed without incident, but it seemed like one of the longest nights of my life. For a while I tried to guess which name it was based on the length of the paper. I thought for sure it was Vilsack and then Gephardt, because the paper seemed to be low enough to cover a lower-case P. I never guessed Edwards. I was too tired to sit without falling asleep and too excited to avoid pacing.</span></p> <p><span>At 6:15 a.m. I returned to my other duties, which included loading the baggage of 50 press and 20 traveling staffers onto the luggage truck. I watched over the departure of the all the staff from the hotel, and at 8:20 a.m., when I was sure everyone was gone, I headed to Market Square in downtown Pittsburgh to assist with the event. I helped direct the people though the barricades, filling them in where it would look just right for the photo. A young but expert crowd herder gave me and 15 volunteers orders on directing the crowd, moving barricades and keeping people happy. He had explained the day before that all of his orders came with a please and thank you, even if he lacked the time to articulate them.</span></p> <p><span>Our brilliant and seasoned site workers had hidden a huge Kerry Edwards banner behind the stage and many t-shirts and placards underneath. They ran around with unshaven faces, wearing t-shirts from past Kerry rallies and police-style radios strapped to their shoulders, making sure that every detail of the rally, from the flags to the rope line music, would be perfect. Like me, they had been up all night. Unlike me, they would catch flights that very afternoon to build the site of a rally in Raleigh, N.C., which drew 25,000 people four days later.</span></p> <p><span>Though the experiences I am having on the campaign are incredibly unforgettable and rewarding, the best part about the campaign is the people I work with. Every person on staff cares deeply about changing this country and is willing to work seven days a week and often miss sleep in order to accomplish this goal. They put their personal lives on hold for a purpose that will change history.</span></p> <p><span>Another group that I\u2019ve come to appreciate through my interactions is the secret service agents, especially in light of my previous stereotype of them as rigid and humorless. Like the advance staff, the agents work long and thankless hours with an incredible level of professionalism.</span></p> <p><span>Whether on the road or in the office, I have never met more committed and die hard workers than the people I work with on the campaign. Behind the scenes, they rarely receive recognition for their toil. Sometimes Subway is the closest they come to dinner and four hours is the closest they come to a night\u2019s sleep. But they survive with a sense of humor, large amounts of satay, and common goals. And I cannot forget the cheerful charter flight crew who have sacrifice six months of their lives to participate in this marathon. I will be eternally grateful for the lunch they bought me at a deli near our hotel when I had no cash.</span></p> <p><span>In my short experience in the real world, I\u2019ve never seen people work as hard and love their jobs as much as those who work on the campaign. As an advance genius told us at Advance School, \u201cwe are involved in the single largest nonviolent takeover in the history of the world.\u201d But I think that beyond a common purpose, we are drawn together by a sense of community and interdependence.</span></p> <p><span>I\u2019ve never done something as uplifting. I want to savor this while it lasts because the days are flying by. And whether we end in victory or defeat, I\u2019ll share it with the best team I have ever been a part of.</span></p> <p><span><i>Nicholas F. B.

I can\u2019t help but feel left out on the sidelines.</span></p> <p><span>Amidst the team rivalries and the constitutional quarrels, Europe\u2019s nations are connecting and working together. And as more and more countries enter the EU\u2014and get better at football\u2014Europeans are more conscious and conscientious of their neighboring countries than ever before. With the continent\u2019s dedication to cooperation, there\u2019s little patience for those who chose to play by their own rules. As the resident of a country whose name has become synonymous with unilateralism, my citizenship has become somewhat of a social liability.</span></p> <p><span>A few weeks ago I was sitting in a pub after the incredibly exciting English-Portugal football (soccer) game when conversation shifted from sports to politics. A few Brits remarked how odd it was that America seems to be the only country in the world that is not obsessed with the game. One rather hostile Brit turned to me and remarked, \u201cI guess your country ignores the sport the same way they ignore everything else that the world cares about.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>I can barely stomach our country\u2019s recent foreign policy\u2014let alone identify myself with it. But for many non-Americans, our government\u2019s recent policies reflect a larger society that is little concerned about anything outside its own borders. Between our withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, our past opposition to both the Kyoto agreement on global warming and the International Criminal Court, and now Iraq, it was hard to argue with the guy. As The Economist noted just this week, \u201cin private, much of Europe\u2019s political class detests Mr Bush and what he stands for, which they think is throwing the superpower\u2019s weight around with no regard either for the rules of law, international treaties or the views of allies.\u201d America\u2014packed with its flag-toting, war-mongering citizens\u2014is regarded as a country full of people who take no interest in the rest of the world.</span></p> <p><span>On a recent trip to Paris, I hadn\u2019t even been in the country five minutes before the French\u2019s disapproval of America became all too apparent. Advertisements for Fahrenheit 9/11 were plastered around the metro, while Le Monde Selon Bush (The World According to Bush)\u2014another documentary suggesting that Bush deliberately made erroneous statements about WMDs in Iraq\u2014was playing in theaters. The cover of the daily magazine L\u2019Humanite portrayed Michael Moore dressed up like the Statue of Liberty, wearing his signature baseball cap.</span></p> <p><span>Although Britain is considered our faithful sidekick, the public\u2019s resentment towards American foreign policy seems little different from across the Channel. Tony Blair\u2019s approval ratings have plummeted since he started \u201cacting like the 51st state.\u201d And a politically charged play called Guantanamo: Honor Bound to Defend Freedom draws on the testimony of numerous \u201cenemy combatants\u201d held without due process by the United States in Cuba\u2019s Guantanamo Bay base.</span></p> <p><span>After working abroad for the past month, I\u2019m convinced that if all Americans took some time to live outside the cultural bubble of the United States, our foreign policy priorities would be very different. While many Europeans are accustomed to international travel, a very small minority of Americans even have a passport. And while most Europeans consider multilingualism essential, the vast majority of Americans are lost without English. Europeans tend to be familiar with the politics in neighboring countries, yet only a minority of Americans can even name the capital of Canada, let alone its leader.</span></p> <p><span>Michael Moore once stated that Americans are \u201cpossibly the dumbest people on the planet.\u201d It\u2019s no wonder his books and movies have made such a killing in Europe. A new French comedy called L\u2019Americain (The American) satirizes a foolish young Frenchman who is convinced he wants to be American. The movie\u2019s advertisement features an awkward looking young man posing as the stereotypical \u201cstupid American.\u201d This attitude is duly reflected in Britian\u2019s Jerry Springer: The Opera\u2014a musical parody of the infamous talk show which lampoons America\u2019s most upstanding citizens, satirizing an incompetent redneck, an aspiring stripper and a Ku Klux Klan member among others.</span></p> <p><span>Some argue that the unique position of the U.S. allows it to be more insular: The countries in Europe are physically and influentially small while America spans the width of a continent and boasts global authority. But that ought to be a reason for Americans to be more concerned with the rest of the world\u2014not less. Our economic and political decisions have the potential to have a global impact. That\u2019s a lot of responsibility for a country branded as only interested in its own well-being.</span></p> <p><span>I\u2019m not idealistic enough to believe that a quick change in our policies while improve our global popularity. Nor am I convinced that all the criticism of America\u2019s insularity is warranted. But I do believe if Americans spent a bit more energy connecting with the rest of the world, we\u2019d be in a better global standing than we are today.

It\u2019s exactly the type of rhetoric I had heard all throughout high school. \u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t be gay at Brentwood. They should wait until university. It\u2019s better there,\u201d said a senior administrator at my high school. Well, I waited.</span></p> <p><span>Last year, like most arriving first-years, I wanted a cliched fresh start. As I flipped through the pages of the freshman facebook, I began to believe that the task was hopeless. I cringed at the ice cream social when a high school acquaintance introduced my friend Tracy and me as \u201cpremier Canadian debaters\u201d to hordes of new faces. Following the incident, Tracy decided that in order to escape our debating past, she would tell everyone that we were international runway models.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHarvard people are so scared of being intolerant. They will believe anything,\u201d she said. Now, as much as I love to fabricate stories of jaunts to the runways of Milan, Paris and New York, the model guise didn\u2019t quite fit. And even despite working part-time this summer for Vitals, a new men\u2019s luxury lifestyle magazine, I doubt that I will soon be sporting the latest threads from John Galliano\u2019s spring collection.</span></p> <p><span>But I got my fresh start. I didn\u2019t join the debate team or run for Undergraduate Council. Instead I was elected as the Public Relations Chair of the Bisexual, Gay, Lesbian, Transgender and Supporters Alliance (BGLTSA) and I joined the staff of Fifteen Minutes, The Crimson\u2019s weekend magazine. To those who know me at Harvard, these activities seem like they come as second nature. And yet, a little more than a year ago, I didn\u2019t have a school newspaper to write for and I wasn\u2019t even \u201cout\u201d to my parents.</span></p> <p><span>Most people who know me well at Harvard assume I was out in high school.

My high school was and is ripe with homophobia. \u201cThat\u2019s so gay\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re such a fag\u201d were commonplace pejoratives in the dorms and on the sports fields. It was not until the very end of my senior year that I de facto came out as a result of my graduation speech, which started with the line \u201cYou\u2019re such a fag.\u201d My speech explored issues of tolerance and accepting meaningful change.</span></p> <p><span>Now that I am interning for the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) I have noticed more than ever that people are not always as you expect them to be. In less than a year, I have gone from being in the closet to being lambasted by national conservative newspapers for transgender activism on behalf of the BGLTSA. The word \u201cgay\u201d for me has changed from a shameful denial of my sexuality to a proud celebration of who I am.</span></p> <p><span>One of my projects for GLAAD is to complete their Announcing Equality campaign, which is aimed at creating a directory of newspapers nationwide that print same-sex wedding announcements. It aims to represent a way for BGLT people to share their unions\u2014and for people to know more about the families that share their community. My job is to call up papers from Arkansas to California and ask about their policies. At first, I was skeptical calling papers in some of the states. It didn\u2019t seem to make much sense to try and explain why it was important to print same-sex wedding announcements to a community newspaper in a predominantly Southern Baptist community in Louisiana, but every couple of calls I would get a surprising response. \u201cSure, why not?\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t see any reason not to.\u201d These responses are coming from papers in rural Nebraska and the heartland of Texas.</span></p> <p><span>While making these calls from an air-conditioned office in midtown Manhattan may not stop the hate crimes or discrimination against BGLT people across the United States, it has certainly demonstrated to me that assumptions are what have divided this country. President Bush\u2019s rhetoric of \u201ctraditional values\u201d is nothing more than a deceptive ploy to appease a select number of religious zealots and conservative politicos.</span></p> <p><span>It won\u2019t take long before same-sex wedding announcements start appearing all over the country, even in the communities of \u201ctraditional values.\u201d When they do, it will become harder and harder for anti-gay activists to spew their hateful rhetoric against the happily married Mr. and Mr. Smith that live next door and take their daughter to the same dance class.</span></p> <p><span>It\u2019s nice to know that someday in the future my name might grace the pages of the Wedding section of The New York Times\u2014or, even more astonishingly, my hometown paper, The St. Helena Star.</span></p> <p><span><i>Adam P.

{"title": "Trio of Democrats Criticizes Bush | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Staunch constitutional defender Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W. Va., lambasted the Bush administration\u2019s restrictions on civil liberties in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in a joint appearance with Sen. Edward M. Kennedy \u201954-\u201956, D-Mass., and Gen. Wesley Clark on Tuesday at Cambridge\u2019s First Parish Church.</span></p> <p><span>The event\u2014nominally a discussion of Byrd\u2019s recently released book Losing America: Confronting A Reckless And Arrogant Presidency co-sponsored by Harvard Book Store and Cambridge Forum before a packed house\u2014provided a forum for the trio to aggressively criticize President Bush\u2019s handling of U.S. foreign policy in the spotlight of the Democratic National Convention without the restrictions imposed by candidate John F. Kerry\u2019s campaign staff.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhen I was walking to pick up my I.D. [after retiring from the United States Army], I ran into a colonel, who told me that no one is in charge out there,\u201d Clark said. \u201cAnd now I know that he was right.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Kennedy, who along with Clark introduced Byrd prior to his keynote oration, made light of his colleague\u2019s lengthy tenure and his own before kicking off an attack on Bush.</span></p> <p><span>\u201c[Byrd] and I intend to stay in this job until we get the hang of it,\u201d Kennedy joked to the delight of the audience.</span></p> <p><span>Byrd, the third-longest serving member of Congress in American history, berated Bush and his subordinates for overstepping the traditional powers of the executive branch and undermining intragovernmental checks by imposing unprecedented levels of secrecy on their misdeeds.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe foundations of our government have suffered,\u201d Byrd said. \u201cThe liberties enshrined in the Constitution of the United States have been besieged by a presidency that is bent on a ruthless pursuit of power, that sees itself above the law, that relies on secrecy and manipulation in order to advance its own partisan agenda.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Drawing heavily upon the principles handed down by the United States founders, Byrd argued that no single individual was ever meant to wield such influence over the fate of the nation.</span></p> <p><span>Channeling Federalist Papers co-author James Madison, Byrd expounded the merits of the separation of powers, \u201cthe ultimate guarantors of the liberties of the people.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Byrd did not, however, place the entirety of the blame on the shoulders of Bush and his deputies, instead faulting his fellow members of Congress for failing to fulfill their Constitutional duties, merely kowtowing to the president and his agenda.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cDespite this heritage, the Congress has been, in too many cases, more than willing to walk away from its Constitutional powers,\u201d Byrd said. \u201cWe have turned a blind eye to the Bush administration\u2019s ruthless pursuit of power\u2014we scorn those nations which have long been our friends.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMembers of Congress, especially those in the majority party, do whatever the president wants them to do,\u201d he added. \u201cIf he says jump, they jump. If he says be quiet, they\u2014and, sadly, too many in my own party\u2014we remain silent.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Kennedy credited Byrd\u2019s staunch anti-war stance and impassioned speeches on the floor of the Senate prior to the invasion of Iraq for providing a voice to the masses seeking peaceful resolution of the conflict. Their rapid dispersal over the internet testified to the nature of free speech in the 21st century, he later added.</span></p> <p><span>Byrd explained his resistance in historical terms, framing it as part of a larger, age-old battle against repression in any form.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cOur founding fathers struggled to escape the heavy yoke of one King George,\u201d Byrd said. \u201cWe must not acquiesce to the dictates of another. As Brutus said to Cicero when Cicero was attempting to curry special favor of Antony, \u2018Our ancestors would have scorned even a gentle master.\u2019\u201d</span></p> <p><span>All three speakers condemned America\u2019s abandonment of international cooperation for the Bush administration\u2019s de facto unilateralism, arguing that it weakened both the United States\u2019 prestige and ability to  wage the war on terror successfully.</span></p> <p><span>The Bush administration\u2019s policies \u201chave changed the face of America around the globe from that of a giant peacemaker to that of a schoolyard bully,\u201d Byrd said. \u201cPeople who once declared strong allegiance with America now question our purpose. That is not America.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Pointing to Byrd\u2019s example, both Kennedy and Clark encouraged members of the audience to help rein in the Bush administration\u2019s excesses. Though both agreed that most citizens could not be expected to curb government missteps as effectively as Byrd, each argued that a small contribution combined with those of similar-minded individuals could vote Kerry into the White House.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt is the soldier\u2019s responsibility to follow the orders or the Commander in Chief,\u201d Clark said. \u201cAnd most wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. But [providing a check on the president] is the responsibility of every citizen.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Byrd emphatically echoed that sentiment, calling upon the audience to overcome the bitter partisanship that currently divides America and to launch a coordinated effort to prevent \u201cthe dimming of freedom\u2019s flame.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Mirroring his comments on the duties of his Congressional colleagues, Byrd emphasized the importance of exercising those freedoms of expression and thought curtailed by the current administration\u2019s policies.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cA single act of bravery can lead an army against great odds,\u201d Byrd said. \u201cThe strength of a single individual can give hope to the hopeless, voice to the voiceless, power to the powerless. And the precious light of liberty will once again burn brightly.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis is the hour of decision,\u201d he added. \u201cLet us fight to save our country.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff writer Timothy J.

However, she said she has been overwhelmed by the interest expressed despite the lack of publicity.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe didn\u2019t expect people to learn about it so quickly,\u201d she said, \u201cbut they were really yearning for it.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The event, which sold out several days in advance, \u201cprovides a cross section of writers to represent the kinds of books our constituency would be interested in,\u201d Wagley said. Each author had recently released a hardcover or paperback book that was available for purchase and signing.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cBooks serve as tools and even weapons in the political struggles of every era,\u201d Conason said in his opening remarks. \u201cToday, buying books is a form of political activism,\u201d and the Progressive Book Club aims to create a community in which that activism can be expressed.</span></p> <p><span>The club hopes to use meet-up technology eventually to create panels on- and offline for the public, each with an author to contribute.</span></p> <p><span>Four different kinds of writers were chosen for the panel, to reflect the fact that a variety of styles can lead to cultural change. Morrison was the novelist, Franken the polemicist, Blumenthal the journalist and Kennedy the advocate.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cGreat artists may not write to change the world, but they cannot help but do it,\u201d Conason said. Books that represent \u201cour shared American values\u201d will promote lasting change, he said.</span></p> <p><span>One point repeated by all the panelists was the media\u2019s failure to provide balanced coverage.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe United States is the only country that establishes a place in our democracy for books, for press, for expression, for freedom of expression,\u201d Blumenthal said. \u201c[The press] has failed in its constitutional role of providing checks and balances to an overwhelming executive.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The solution, then, is books.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt was a book after all that helped sustain the Revolution,\u201d Blumenthal pointed out.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cA kind of urgency informs [books],\u201d Morrison said. \u201cAn urgency that can lift the veil that has descended over honest informative public debate.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Morrison also spoke of the importance of print and culture in terms of conflict. Race, she said, \u201chas exposed the obvious and inevitable conflicts between empire and democracy, between cannibalism and democracy. These have unfolded into culture war.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Morrison said the culture war was safer than those of previous generations, being fought with rhetoric rather than artillery, but said that if the country continued to use \u201cmedieval solutions to 20th-century problems,\u201d the conflict would never be sufficiently addressed.</span></p> <p><span>Wagley mentioned that she was somewhat uncomfortable with the idea of a war.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cBalance is what we strive for,\u201d she said. She said the tenor created by the right, however, which \u201chas actually institutionalized since the \u201960s to dominate our media sphere,\u201d meant that battle lines were clearly and inextricably drawn.</span></p> <p><span>The battle that often follows such confrontation was addressed by Franken.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI didn\u2019t prepare any remarks because I hate writing,\u201d he began.</span></p> <p><span>Amid escalating laughter, Franken told of the lawsuit brought by Fox against his book, Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them,  on behalf of Fox News Channel host Bill O\u2019Reilly, who objected to being called a liar.</span></p> <p><span>The suit was eventually dismissed because \u201csatire is a protected form of public speech, even if the object of satire doesn\u2019t get it,\u201d Franken said.</span></p> <p><span>Franken was a favorite for the audience, later blacklisted by \u201cBillionaires for Bush,\u201d a satirical protest group (see story, page 4), and given a collection of songs from the \u201cBush on Mars\u201d campaign.</span></p> <p><span>When one questioner frustratingly asked, \u201cWhat am I going to do,\u201d Franken rejoined, \u201cYou\u2019re going to vote for Kerry.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But the standing ovation was reserved for Robert Kennedy Jr., who spoke passionately about what he called the Bush administration\u2019s systematic undermining of environmental legislation.</span></p> <p><span>For example, Kennedy said, because of previously illegal coal burning corporations in the Ohio Valley, asthma has reached an unprecedented level in newborns.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWithout my resources I would be hard pressed to keep my children alive,\u201d Kennedy said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt has taken 300 years [for our country] to get the world\u2019s respect, and three and a half years for this president to destroy it,\u201d Kennedy said.</span></p> <p><span>He therefore supports presidential candidate Sen.

{"title": "That '60's Show: With Barack Obama in the Starring Role | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>BOSTON, Tuesday, July 27\u2014Democrats are fond of talking about the future these days, but walking on the floor of the Democratic National Convention (DNC) this week, there were times when it resembled nothing so much as a big nostalgia show.</span></p> <p><span>I\u2019m not sure what did it for me\u2014whether it was Peter Yarrow\u2019s <i>Mighty Wind</i>-ish rehearsal of \u201cIf I Had a Hammer,\u201d the big screens flashing \u201cGO JOHNNY GO\u201d over Chuck Berry\u2019s bell-ringing guitar, or the blown-up photo of the young John Kerry looking cool in a leather jacket beside John Lennon. But halfway through Tuesday night it hit me: We\u2019re not close to done with the \u201960s.</span></p> <p><span>And so what? It\u2019s not as if the DNC manufactured the national fixation on the happy, miserable decade between Eisenhower and Nixon; for many of our college-age generation, it\u2019s unavoidable.</span></p> <p><span>My favorite current rock bands sleep with copies of <i>Sgt. Pepper</i> under their pillows, and I cherish few pastimes as fondly as that of imagining my parents (or myself) taking an active part in each and every social, political and cultural watershed of that era. I\u2019m as proud that my father was tear-gassed marching against the war in Washington in October 1967 (his second date with my mother, a year or so later, was at another peace rally) as that he cut a low-rent lyrical folk-pop album at the end of the decade. Sure, cynics might brand the DNC itself a dad trying too hard to be cool, but I for one appreciated the myriad nods to a decade when change somehow managed both to happen on a huge scale and to aim far higher than it could ever reach.</span></p> <p><span>The trouble is, this wasn\u2019t the real \u201960s\u2014like the bizarre parliamentary spectacle of the platform\u2019s adoption by a half-empty floor, it was a show. There wouldn\u2019t be any 1968-style riot and repression, to be sure, but along with that current of radical danger seemed to have gone any spirit of radical promise.</span></p> <p><span>We got former Vermont Gov. Howard B. Dean, yes, and no amount of convention committee vetting could entirely dampen the sincere righteousness that made him such a compelling candidate way back when. But there\u2019s no denying that this was a different Dean than we knew in January, a firebrand muted. Even Sen. Edward M. Kennedy \u201954-\u201956, D-Mass., seemed more restrained than usual, earning applause that must have been more for his sterling record as the Senate\u2019s proud liberal leader than anything he said Tuesday night.</span></p> <p><span>Then there was Ron Reagan\u2014his appearance, or more accurately his name, a huge coup for the convention. Still, Reagan delivered his altogether correct views on stem-cell research in the mellow tones of a genial, almost-vacant Mr. Wizard. It\u2019s not that the speech wasn\u2019t effective or right; it\u2019s that there was something creepily stagey about it throughout.</span></p> <p><span>The problem that became obvious on Tuesday night is that\u2014though the party itself is far less divided than it was in the 1960s\u2014this was a convention that couldn\u2019t quite decide what it wanted to be. Speakers who must have been dying for a chance to lace into the current administration\u2019s moral bankruptcy and pragmatic failures were reportedly told to lay off the Bush-bashing for fear of alienating those precious swingers. And so this week inhabited an odd political twilight zone: an opposition party seeking to rescue the nation midway through what seems the worst eight years of misgovernance in memory, the Dems forced themselves to put on a happy face.</span></p> <p><span>On Monday, this issue was swept under the rug by the speakers\u2019 bronzed star power. Al Gore \u201969 is allowed to be bitter about the 2000 election, as long as he pretends he\u2019s joking.</span></p> <p><span>Jimmy Carter\u2019s Nobel lets him say whatever he wants. (And saying Bush misled the American people\u2014wow, that\u2019s pretty hot stuff. Kudos to the convention\u2019s planners for managing to make even so simple a factual criticism as this taboo for anyone but a former president.)</span></p> <p><span>Bill Clinton, ever the down-to-earth rhetorical genius, was nimble enough to brutalize Bush\u2019s record, point out the successes of his own and promote John Kerry better than the candidate could ever do himself\u2014almost without seeming to do any of the three.</span></p> <p><span>Sen. Hillary Clinton, D-N.Y., would no doubt have been just as masterful had she been given the full speech she deserved. Forced to play the well-trained wife in a five-minute introduction (and, to her eternal credit, going on for 11 instead), she hardly had room to show off her oratorical skill before bowing out for Bill.</span></p> <p><span>On Wednesday and Thursday, meanwhile, the importance of Edwards and Kerry themselves made the convention\u2019s identity crisis easy to ignore. Tuesday, then, presented an existential question of sorts: without old heroes or current leaders to focus the spotlight on, how would the Democratic Party present itself?</span></p> <p><span>The answer, apparently, was to pack in as many different sides of the party as could be fit, all tamed to fit the DNC stage. A calmly intense Teresa Heinz Kerry, the former candidates (Gephardt and Mosely-Braun in addition to Dean), Senate majority leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., Reagan, a young star of \u201cThe O.C.\u201d (?!), the younger (13 years old) founder of Kids for Kerry, an enthusiastic group of dancers\u2014all came on and went off, charging the crowd admirably at times but leaving little lasting impression.</span></p> <p><span>The only speaker, then, who really captivated those who saw him was Barack Obama, ahead of whose currently unopposed Illinois senatorial campaign the savviest pols are leapfrogging to declare him the odds-on favorite for the nation\u2019s first non-white president. That kind of dreaming might be a little premature for the former first black president of the Harvard Law Review, but seeing Obama\u2019s vital performance on Tuesday made it seem almost required.</span></p> <p><span>Obama seemed the only speaker who was able to pull off what the Dems were aiming for with any success. Deftly modulating his style from high to low, common-sense talk to vaulted preaching, big-picture issues to personal journey, Obama knew how to avoid being another caged animal in a superficial circus: He was the circus, jumping from topic to topic and mood to mood so swiftly that the audience had no choice but to come along for the ride. This was unabashed politics, genuine and forceful, and the contrast with the night\u2019s other speakers was impossible to ignore.</span></p> <p><span>Obama is, clearly, the party\u2019s future. But in the end, his style was the real \u201960s legacy at the FleetCenter on Tuesday. That era\u2019s greatest speakers succeeded by bridging gaps in exactly the same way Obama showed himself capable of\u2014by relating to audiences on a human level but inspiring unshakable confidence in their ability to lead.</span></p> <p><span>For now, the Democrats will focus on putting forward a candidate who forged his long career in public service in that decade\u2019s crises of conscience. But far louder than the instrumental of the Beatles\u2019 \u201cRevolution\u201d playing from the rafters earlier, Obama promised an uprising of principles to come that will make good on all the \u201960s\u2019 promises.</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff writer Simon W.

{"title": "Existential Moments at the DNC | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Lauren A.E. Schuker", "body": "<p><span>BOSTON, Tuesday, July 27\u2014It was Tuesday night, and Teresa Heinz Kerry was addressing an enthusiastic audience in the FleetCenter, describing hardships encountered during her youth in Mozambique, \u201cgrowing up in a dictatorship.\u201d Oddly, she forgot to mention that she escaped that very dictatorship by going to Geneva for graduate school.</span></p> <p><span>With her exotic south African accent, Heinz Kerry addressed the crowd in her five languages, explaining that she has come to cherish her own \u201cright to speak [her] mind, to have a voice, to be what some have called \u2018opinionated\u2019...but instead of being labeled opinionated, will be called smart or well-informed, just as men are.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>And in one corner of the convention floor, another \u201copinionated\u201d woman began speaking her mind.</span></p> <p><span>A woman dressed head to toe in pink (complete with slippers), a member of Code Pink, a liberal women\u2019s group based in San Francisco that protests against the war in Iraq, interrupted the speech, chanting, \u201cWhat about the war, Teresa? What about the war?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Not noticing the interruption, Heinz Kerry continued, lauding all \u201cthe women of this world, whose wise voices for much too long have been excluded and discounted.\u201d  She told the audience that it was \u201ctime for the world to hear women\u2019s voices, in full and at last.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>And the Code Pink woman\u2019s chants could be heard. Just not very well.</span></p> <p><span>The press still instantly mobbed her\u2014could this be The Story of the news-less convention?\u2014and made enough noise to cause a minor commotion. Spontaneity at the DNC is that hard to find.</span></p> <p><span>Security pounced on the woman (who, by the way, was wearing a coveted \u201cred\u201d press credential, which allowed her access to the floor), dragging her off the floor to the backstage area before she had a chance to finish her chant.</span></p> <p><span>So much for the Democratic party\u2019s loyalty to free speech.</span></p> <p><span>The woman, and her cloth banner that read \u201cDemocrats for Free Peace,\u201d disappeared into the backstage area, while the press\u2014a smattering of rookie New York Times and Washington Post reporters looking for a scoop, local newscasters, and photographers\u2014trailed behind, shouting questions in her direction.</span></p> <p><span>Rumors quickly began\u2014that they were going to arrest the woman, that they had stripped her and were interrogating her in the backstage area\u2014but the excitement died in minutes. Reporters who were scribbling furiously one moment stuffed their notebooks back into their bags and returned to the convention floor, hoping to catch Teresa\u2019s final words about restoring \u201cfaith in America.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>It was democracy at its worst. A speaker on stage, spouting ideals that were repudiated by what was enacted in front of her. And a media, so hungry for spontaneity and authenticity that it causes more commotion than the interruption.</span></p> <p><span>The convention itself is a little bit like that. Quick moments of excitement, followed by disappointing, drawn-out periods of choreographed ritual and meticulously planned ceremony.</span></p> <p><span>But the question remains: Why are 15,000 journalists in town for an event that is nearly completely scripted?</span></p> <p><span>Certainly, the days of gavel-to-gavel coverage of the convention by television media are gone, reduced to a mere three hours. Heinz Kerry\u2019s speech didn\u2019t even make it onto prime time. And while the television networks opting to cut back convention coverage in favor of airing more \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d episodes might fare better in terms of viewer numbers, they too are depriving Americans of an opportunity.</span></p> <p><span>In his detailed account of the McGovern-Nixon race, Fear and Loathing: On the Campaign Trail \u201972, Hunter S. Thompson wrote that the 1972 Democratic Convention in Miami was \u201cshaping up very fast these days as one of the most brutal and degrading animal acts of our time.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>And maybe his words apply today.</span></p> <p><span>With journalists at the convention outnumbering delegates by a three-to-one ratio, I expected this to be the event of the year. I expected the hordes of press to track down leads, sniff out scandals and uncover dirt. And if all that didn\u2019t work out, I expected to get educated on \u201cthe issues.\u201d I expected to learn something about the real John Kerry.</span></p> <p><span>But if anything, I learned that the whole convention\u2014with its 15,000 journalists along for the ride\u2014is just entertainment, a show for the masses.</span></p> <p><span>The average citizen is barricaded from the convention, separated by snipers, secret service and color-coded credential passes. Think of the irony that the Democratic convention is closed to the public\u2014but open to the media. And for the media there are six different colored press passes\u2014like six different social stratifications.</span></p> <p><span>As a notable Harvard alum, T. S. Eliot, Class of 1910, once wrote in a context wildly different from the one in which I quote him here, \u201cBetween the idea / And the reality / Between the motion / And the act / Falls the Shadow.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>This \u201cshadow,\u201d the gray area that exists between intention and act, the place where we hope the real John Kerry and the party\u2019s real goals exist, cannot be seen during the three hours the convention got on network television this week. And it cannot be gleaned from the pull-out sections that the national newspapers have run all week.  In fact, the Democratic party has taken every possible measure to ensure the elimination of this \u201cshadow\u201d from its convention, working to choreograph every moment of the image it has presented all week\u2014its own carefully constructed page of American history.</span></p> <p><span>Instead of running another story about how bloggers are revolutionizing the convention, the national media should focus on why the convention needs to be reinvented.</span></p> <p><span>Everything democracy stands for is violated by the current convention, and it\u2019s time for the party to listen to its citizens, to invite some of them to let their voices be heard. The DNC opened its doors to the nations\u2019 media\u2014constructing a tent from which they could file stories, setting up wireless connections for bloggers\u2014and it is high time that they let the nation\u2019s citizens participate too.</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff writer Lauren A.E.

{"title": "Panel Says Terrorism Will Be Top Priority | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Combating terrorism and restoring international faith in American leadership headline the foreign policy objectives that will await the winner of November\u2019s presidential election, according to a panel of speakers Tuesday afternoon at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum.</span></p> <p><span>The discussion, moderated by Kennedy School of Government professor David Gergen, underscored the likelihood of another large-scale attack on the United States and the Bush administration\u2019s failure to adequately redirect government resources to counter that threat.</span></p> <p><span>Dillon Professor of Government Graham T. Allison Jr. predicted a nuclear strike against America or its allies \u201cwithin the next decade.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI can\u2019t even work my way through that scenario without saying I don\u2019t want to go there,\u201d Allison said.</span></p> <p><span>According to Sultan of Oman Professor of International Relations Joseph S. Nye, Jr., technological innovation at the end of the 20th century, coinciding with the emergence of determined non-state actors, created a global landscape in which traditional deterrents and the \u201chard power\u201d of military force are rendered ineffective.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cA Stalin or Hitler could kill millions of people,\u201d Nye said. \u201cBut a pathological individual previously required a totalitarian framework.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But with failed states providing a haven for terrorists and nuclear technology more readily available from rogue nations like North Korea, which \u201cwill sell to anybody\u201d according to Allison, single individuals are capable of visiting on their target levels of damage hundreds of times greater than in the past.</span></p> <p><span>According to Allison, the first step in confronting nuclear terrorism\u2019s \u201cfinite challenge\u201d is securing existent nuclear stockpiles in the former Soviet Union, which pose an imminent threat insufficiently addressed by the Bush administration.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIn the two years after 9/11, fewer potential nuclear weapons in Russia were secured than in the two years before,\u201d Allison said.</span></p> <p><span>In addition to the threat of nuclear weapons from the former Soviet Union falling into the wrong hands, the United States must also contend with the distinct possibility of nuclear neophyte Pakistan falling to Islamic fundamentalists. In Pakistan, according to Allison, four in five prefer the foreign policy strategy employed by Osama bin Laden to that of President Bush.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf you look at Pakistan, this is really a ticking time bomb,\u201d Allison said. \u201cIt\u2019s hanging by the thread of Gen. Pervez Musharraf. And he\u2019s twice been within a second and a half of assassination the last six months.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Moreover, Allison argued, the decision to commit troops to Iraq has provided the other two members of the \u201cAxis of Evil\u201d with more time to further their own nuclear ambitions, while curtailing potential U.S. responses. Though North Korea had consented to freeze its nuclear program, Pyongyang long circumvented treaty obligations by drawing necessary materials from an uninspected source prior to booting United Nations weapons inspectors.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere\u2019s two imminent threats and the third is a bad guy,\u201d Allison said. \u201cNorth Korea was in fact selling a bomb\u2019s worth of uranium hexafluoride and Iran was sneaking [past inspectors],\u201d Allison said. \u201cIf Bush had shot North Korea or Iran, I might have supported him.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But despite threats elsewhere and the shift in popular support against the war in Iraq and its handling, withdrawal constitutes the worst alternative, according to Nye.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf we pull out of Iraq quickly and leave behind a failed state like Lebanon in the \u201980s and Afghanistan in the \u201990s, it will become a new haven for transnational terrorists,\u201d Nye said. \u201cAnd they won\u2019t wait for us to come get them. They\u2019ll come get us over here.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In addition to nation building, creating an environment hostile to terrorists also requires better deployment of \u201csoft power,\u201d according to Nye.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cYou can\u2019t do it without winning the hearts and minds,\u201d Nye said. \u201cYou see this not as a clash of civilizations but a civil war within Islam.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But as a reaction to the increased threat of terrorism, the United States is backing away from one of the most powerful weapons in its soft power arsenal\u2014education.</span></p> <p><span>The same bureaucracies that mistakenly allowed the Sept. 11 hijackers into the country are now overreacting in regard to student visas, Nye said, limiting America\u2019s ability both to woo young scholars with its ideals and to transplant those values abroad.</span></p> <p><span>Given prior commitments in Iraq, carving out a successful foreign policy also requires a major departure from preferred business as usual for the Bush administration according to the panelists\u2014reforging bonds with traditional Western European allies and cultivating an arena in which multilateral action is the norm, not the product of convenience.</span></p> <p><span>Though the administration cast aside several prominent allies in ousting Hussein, the strain placed on its armed forces has encouraged cooperation with Iran, China and North Korea, prompting speculation that the failures in Iraq had ushered in a new era of Bush foreign policy.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cTake people like Paul Wolfowitz, who said we\u2019re going to need 50,000 troops to win the war or control Baghdad,\u201d Nye said. \u201cNow he\u2019ll seem a little less credible.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But in addition to merely working with its allies when such assistance is required, the next administration must convince its partners that it values their judgment and aid, according to Samantha J. Power, a lecturer in public policy at the Kennedy School.</span></p> <p><span>Pursuing that course requires \u201cnot pretending that history hasn\u2019t happened and reckoning in a way very few politicians have done,\u201d she said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cPart of this has to be about \u2018how can people hear us and take us seriously?\u2019\u201d she added.</span></p> <p><span>Enhanced communication abroad must be mirrored by similar improvements within the U.S. military and among domestic agencies, said Elaine Kamarck, lecturer of public policy at the Kennedy School, or else the United States will not be able to defend itself against modern enemies.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe had a government that was built for an entirely different time, that was built for the Cold War,\u201d Kamarck said. \u201cWhat do we do about the question of American intelligence? Do we try to create a sort of American MI-5 or do we work using the existing FBI framework?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Kamarck did not elaborate on precisely what steps the government ought to take to adapt, but she said that interagency territoriality currently hampers the fight against terror.</span></p> <p><span>Moreover, sharing of information must not be limited to the highest circles of the CIA and FBI, she said, or else its effects will be minimal.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cYou want FBI chiefs who are on the ground in Bahrain talking to CIA station chiefs,\u201d Kamarck said. \u201cBy the time they\u2019re talking about it in the White House, it\u2019s too late.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Kamarck also cited the war in Iraq as a clear indication that the U.S. military needs to update its training and structure, preparing more special forces and quick-strike units, in addition to ensuring an adequate number of military police.</span></p> <p><span>Although panelists generally agreed that Sen. John Kerry\u2019s, D-Mass., foreign policy would likely mark a return to increased multilateral action, Gergen questioned the vagueness both candidates have employed in describing future international relations.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI cannot remember a campaign where the candidates were so opaque about their agenda,\u201d Gergen said. \u201cIt does seem to me that the voters ought to be able to go to the polls with more than a sniff.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff writer Timothy J.

{"title": "Professors Identify Key Domestic Issues | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Three prominent Harvard faculty members identified what they considered to be the most important issues facing the United States in the next decade at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum on Monday in front of a crowd of hundreds composed mostly of adults visiting the area for the Democratic National Convention.</span></p> <p><span>University President Lawrence H. Summers moderated the panel.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe decision we are going to have to make in the next decade is whether we are serious about government,\u201d Summers said. \u201cI would suggest to you that there are no examples of countries that achieve their national interests without being well and complicatedly governed.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Dean of the Kennedy School of Government David T. Ellwood \u201975 said that the government needs to concern itself with the changing makeup of the working population, stressing that \u201cdemography is destiny.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Ellwood said because of the aging Baby Boom population, the number of native-born working adults aged 25-54 in 20 years will be no different than it is now. In addition, the number of children per household has decreased with the advent of reliable birth control in the 1960s, Ellwood said.</span></p> <p><span>He said that to increase the size and productivity of the economy, the workforce will therefore be forced to rely upon older Americans and immigrants.</span></p> <p><span>But Ellwood said present government policy is not attuned to the needs of immigrants. He said our present policy is to either deport illegal immigrants, or to train immigrants and then ask them to return to their home countries. Illegal immigrants are also not legally able to obtain the same level of public education as citizens.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe are discouraging immigrants in every way we can from becoming part of larger society,\u201d Ellwood said.</span></p> <p><span>Ellwood said America needs to adopt a more realistic policy that focuses on raising the socioeconomic status of immigrant families.</span></p> <p><span>Ellwood also said he was concerned about the disparity in birthrates for mothers from advantaged and disadvantaged backgrounds.</span></p> <p><span>Educated women are choosing to have children later in life, Ellwood said\u2014partly because women have found their wages level out after they have their first child. Consequently, Ellwood said, educated women are also having fewer children.</span></p> <p><span>Conversely, he said, uneducated women are having more children earlier in life.</span></p> <p><span>Ellwood said that in the United States there has been an increasing correlation between the successes of parents and their children. The decreasing number of children born to educated parents and rising number of children of disadvantaged parents thus presents a potential problem to the U.S. economy, he argued.</span></p> <p><span>Ellwood said he thought there needed to be research into making child-rearing less costly in terms of potential wages lost for women with high incomes, and to make professional advancement increasingly possible for women from disadvantaged backgrounds.</span></p> <p><span>Professor of Economics Caroline M. Hoxby \u201988 said the United States needs to improve its educational facilities if it is to remain a superpower. She added that in the global economic structure, companies will invest in the countries with the most skilled people, even if that country is not the one with the most political clout.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf we want to remain one of the richest nations on Earth and get the benefits associated with that, we have to remain highly skilled,\u201d Hoxby said. \u201cWe need an educational factory that produces people with skills. That is something we do not have.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>She said that while the United States has doubled its educational funding since 1970 without seeing marked improvements, other countries have improved their students\u2019 performances without increasing education spending during that same time.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe need to require that everyone acquires a certain level of skills. It is not enough that they go to school and stay there for four years,\u201d Hoxby said.</span></p> <p><span>But Hoxby cautioned that she is unsure that the testing mandated by the controversial No Child Left Behind Act is the best solution to the problem.</span></p> <p><span>Hoxby said the No Child Left Behind Act marked a step forward in legislation because it mandated that all children receive a certain minimum educational level and set a deadline to achieve that goal.</span></p> <p><span>But Hoxby said certain elements of the law are broken.</span></p> <p><span>She said the measurement for determining whether a school is succeeding or failing is often misleading and needs to be fixed by statisticians. She also faulted No Child Left Behind for setting goals without offering practical ways to achieve them. For example, she said, the law decrees that every teacher should be qualified without discussing incentives like raising salaries to improve the overall quality of teachers.</span></p> <p><span>MacArthur Professor of Health Policy and Management Joseph P. Newhouse said the funding of Medicare is the major issue that needs to be addressed, given the current economic forecasts.</span></p> <p><span>Newhouse said Medicare, which currently accounts for 13 percent of government spending, will rise to 16 percent of government spending by the 2020s, according to analysts. He said the government might have to raise taxes by as much as 16 percent to make up for the increased spending\u2014a politically unpopular stance.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere is no reason to believe the increased costs in medical care we\u2019ve seen are going to stop,\u201d Newhouse said.</span></p> <p><span>Newhouse added that each candidate\u2019s campaign pledge to cut the deficit in half over the next four years would clash with the need to increase Medicare spending to keep medical coverage at the present level.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI don\u2019t expect Mr. Kerry or Mr. Bush to take it on in the next term. If they did, they would be doing their successors a huge favor,\u201d Newhouse said.</span></p> <p><span>Summers said that in addition to the issues the other panelists raised, the government would have to address an increase in industrial productivity that will ultimately mean fewer employees will be needed in manufacturing jobs.</span></p> <p><span>The United States should also take advantage of its global societal dominance to confront issues such as income inequality, nuclear proliferation and global warming, Summers said.</span></p> <p><span>He also said the United States needs to provide incentives to capable citizens to protect the country against terrorist attacks.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe need as a society to make changes in public careers that are necessary to attract extraordinary people to careers, both permanent and temporary, in government,\u201d Summers said.</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff writer Alan J.

{"title": "Clinton's Convention | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>BOSTON, Wednesday, July 28\u2014Some Democratic officials worried that the party would have a hard time staying on message this week. But they\u2019ve had no trouble with at least one theme\u2014\u201cDon\u2019t Stop Thinking About 1992.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>This convention has seized on many of the themes that dominated its predecessor 12 years ago and propelled little-known challenger Bill Clinton to the White House. And it has embraced the Clinton legacy in a major way besides.</span></p> <p><span>From day one, this has been the Clinton convention. It paints a stark contrast to 2000, when then-Vice President Al Gore \u201969 ran from Clinton, even picking a vice presidential candidate with Clinton-bashing credentials earned during the impeachment proceedings. Bill owned the hall Monday night, delivering by far the best speech of the convention, and perhaps one of the best in a career of distinguished speeches.</span></p> <p><span>From the minute he stepped on stage, it was clear that his popularity\u2014at least among the faithful\u2014may have even surged since he left office. He seized on their support, rallying them with an appeal to the peace and prosperity over which he presided.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe tried it their way for 12 years, our way for eight, and then their way for four more,\u201d he told the crowd, referring to the Republican administrations surrounding his own. \u201cOur way works better.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Clinton\u2019s reception by the crowd underscored the fact that the Democrats are still, in many ways, Bill\u2019s party. That point has clearly not been lost on Kerry officials, who have tried to run on the Clinton-Gore legacy and emulate 1992.</span></p> <p><span>The upshot has been that even since Bill skipped town Tuesday, the remainder of the convention has clearly been guided by his spirit. Vice presidential candidate Sen. John R. Edwards, D-N.C., made the upbeat, down-home populism of Clinton his own last night, urging listeners to adopt the \u201cpolitics of hope\u201d and reminding them that \u201chope is on the way.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Sound familiar? Does anyone remember the presidential contender from Hope, Ark. who told Americans, \u201cI still believe in a place called Hope\u201d?</span></p> <p><span>That wasn\u2019t all Edwards had learned from Clinton. In fact, their acceptance speeches in \u201992 and \u201904 were remarkably similar, both in style and substance.</span></p> <p><span>Both talked extensively about their working-class family histories, highlighting that their parents had taught them the value of hard work and the importance of treating all people with respect. They both expounded on the importance of racial equality and addressed the need to reach out to those who work full-time and still live in poverty.</span></p> <p><span>Sure, there were some new themes, like Edwards\u2019 \u201ctwo Americas\u201d (which borrowed from Mario Cuomo\u2019s 1984 \u201cTale of Two Cities\u201d Democratic convention address), but to sum up his speech, he might as well have said that he was \u201cputting people first.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The rest of the convention has followed in similar fashion. Organizers have tried to hard to make the proceedings positive and forward-looking, avoiding attacks on President Bush as much as possible.</span></p> <p><span>As a result, while speakers have strong concern about the direction America is heading, most have steered clear of focusing too much on criticisms of Bush. Democratic officials say they hope the more optimistic strategy\u2014employed with great success in 1992\u2014can help propel Kerry to victory.</span></p> <p><span>This works especially well given the limited air time the networks have given the convention this year, a mere three hours. This means that more liberal Democrats like Sen. Edward M. Kennedy \u201954-\u201956, D-Mass., can still be given their chance to speak, and speak critically of Bush, while being hidden from most national viewers, who will likely see little more than the speeches made by Clinton, Kerry, and vice presidential nominee John Edwards.</span></p> <p><span>The convention is being run by a host of ex-Clintonites to boot, including convention chair, Clinton Secretary of Energy and current Arizona Gov. Bill Richardson and Democratic National Committee chair and close Clinton associate Terry McAuliffe.</span></p> <p><span>Even in downtime, the spirit of Clinton still pervades the convention. One of the most frequent time-fillers between on-stage events features an image of Clinton displayed with the following quote on screen, along with a recording of him reciting it:\u201cThomas Jefferson believed that to preserve the very foundations of our nation, we would need dramatic change from time to time. Well, my fellow citizens, this is our time. Let us embrace it.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Convention organizers must only hope that they can emulate Clinton\u2019s sweeping success in 1992 as well as they have appropriated that year\u2019s convention themes.</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff writer Stephen M.

Rather, Reich said, the economy has lost one million jobs over the course of Bush\u2019s presidency\u2014a problem compounded by the need to create 125,000 jobs a month just to keep up with current population growth rates, he said.</span></p> <p><span>Reich added that wages for 80 percent of Americans have dropped since Bush took office in 2001, and that many employers have shifted the burden of paying for health care to workers.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere is no economic recovery,\u201d Reich said.</span></p> <p><span>Reich said the White House has used careful rhetoric to mislead the public about the state of the economy.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhat the Bush administration keeps saying is that average wages keep going up,\u201d said Reich, whose height is just short of 4\u201911\u201d. \u201cThe basketball player Shaquille O\u2019Neal and I have an average height of 6\u20191\u201d .\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Reich also said he could not figure out the economic rationale behind Bush\u2019s tax cuts, which Reich said failed to stimulate the economy.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf you give very rich people tax cuts, they are not going to turn out the extra money. They are already spending as much as they want to spend,\u201d Reich said. \u201cThat is the definition of being rich.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Reich added that the notion of trickle-down economics\u2014the theory that the affluent will pass on the benefits of their tax cuts to their employees\u2014was debunked in the 1980s.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s not trickle-down economics\u2014it\u2019s trickle-on economics,\u201d Reich said. \u201cNothing actually trickles down.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Finally, Reich said the Republican notion of investing in capital is misguided. Democrats invest in things like education and health care instead, Reich said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe [Democrats] don\u2019t invest in property. We don\u2019t invest in capital,\u201d Reich said. \u201cWe invest in people.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff writer Alan J. Tabak can be reached at tabak@fas.harvard.edu.</i></span></p>"}
{"title": "Searching for My Very Own Cross of Gold | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>BOSTON, Monday, July 26\u2014Forgive me if I missed the modern-day equivalent of William Jennings Bryan\u2019s \u201cCross of Gold\u201d speech. But, on more than a few occasions between Miss New Mexico\u2019s dreadful rendering of the Star Spangled Banner at the start of the Democratic National Convention\u2019s first afternoon session and the beginning of nationwide broadcast coverage at 10 p.m., I wasn\u2019t exactly paying overly careful attention.</span></p> <p><span>Sure, I desperately tried to maintain my focus from the seat I had furtively acquired directly behind the Puerto Rican delegation below the Fox News booth. After all, my partner in crime, Lauren A. E. Schuker \u201906, also a Crimson editor, and I had to slip into several zones within the FleetCenter in which our security clearance was not quite good enough, and if we abandoned our prime viewing position, we might not be so fortunate the next time around.</span></p> <p><span>But what, exactly, were we supposed to be watching? The archaic yet riveting parliamentary procedures governing opening the floor for debate? Was anyone actually going to oppose such a motion? Would that have even mattered, or would the presiding officer have just pretended not to hear?</span></p> <p><span>Much to my chagrin, a unanimous second rang out from the one in eight delegates who had stumbled into the arena by that point, with no objections halting Chairman Terry McAuliffe\u2019s order of events. Moments later, several members of the rules committee bounded on stage, advancing steadily on the mahogany podium more distant from where I had just been sitting, ready for their moment in the spotlight\u2014if appearing on C-SPAN to enthusiastically announce the unanimous endorsement of the convention\u2019s rules even qualifies.</span></p> <p><span>I of course was on my way back up the stairs, into the dreaded concourse where my coveted press pass might be revoked at any moment, the din of the first of a host of semi-anonymous Kerry apologists trickling through the doorways back into the hall.</span></p> <p><span>Miraculously, we slipped back down the stairs to the first floor with relatively little hassle from security.</span></p> <p><span>There, far from the neutered speeches with the Kerry campaign stamp of approval, the real fun began. After aimlessly hustling through the main concourse, Schuker and I stopped to join a large crowd gathered to watch a delegate field a series of questions from an average-looking reporter and his television crew.</span></p> <p><span>Turns out that the interviewer was Stephen Colbert, correspondent for \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d on Comedy Central. Cornering his subject on the mechanics of changing a tire\u2014a point of no relevance to the campaign whatsoever\u2014Colbert held a posse of credentialed media and delegates spellbound, eagerly awaiting his next unscripted quip.</span></p> <p><span>Suddenly, an epiphany. Why sit through hours of poorly delivered propaganda when the real fun was to be had safely outside the reach of the DNC\u2019s censors?</span></p> <p><span>Tracking down Biff Henderson of \u201cThe Late Show With David Letterman\u201d transcended all other aims, finding Ben Affleck an irrational calling. After all, you couldn\u2019t quite be sure what they might say\u2014especially when asked, \u201cWhat is John Kerry\u2019s sexiest quality?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Some responded graciously\u2014Colbert carefully crafted an elaborate and witty response worthy of his role on \u201cThe Daily Show.\u201d Others responded incredulously. \u201cYou\u2019re The Harvard Crimson?\u201d Al Franken \u201973 asked, looking for a quick escape.</span></p> <p><span>But then there were those who just didn\u2019t know quite what to do. Entering the FleetCenter after a brief respite in the New York Times\u2019 media center, Schuker and I ran straight into perhaps our most well-known target: the Rev. Jesse Jackson.</span></p> <p><span>With Schuker hot on his heels, Jackson picked up his pace. But unable to shake the feisty reporter after the question had been repeated a third time, he simply muttered, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know that man,\u201d before half-shoving her into a police officer.</span></p> <p><span>Somehow the thought of returning to watch the convention\u2019s evening slate of speakers didn\u2019t seem nearly as interesting in the immediate aftermath.</span></p> <p><span>Planting myself in the nosebleed section alongside a Democratic News Service staffer, I again naively held out hope that \u201cThe Cross of Gold\u201d was not far off. While Schuker schmoozed a blogger in front of us, the staffer bemoaned the lack of network coverage\u2014just an hour a night with nothing on Tuesday.</span></p> <p><span>Ten minutes later we were back in the concourse, again on the prowl for easily flustered politicians. Making our way down to the floor, who should we run into but one University President Lawrence H. Summers, chatting up Sen. Chuck Schumer \u201971, D-N.Y., in an aisle.</span></p> <p><span>If only they had broadcast on television Summers\u2019 reaction to my asking him the question about Kerry\u2019s sexiest trait. Maybe then the conventions could wrangle more than an hour a night of coverage from NBC, since his reaction\u2014 highlighted by a look of horror when informed that James Carville\u2019s answer had been Kerry\u2019s wife\u2014deserved a several-minute montage in itself.</span></p> <p><span>Or maybe the Republican and Democratic conventions could come to grips with the fact that, well, no one wants to watch four straight nights of rehashed campaign slogans. Or an event of any sort with a foregone conclusion. Or several elderly women from Mississippi dancing to a modified version of Chuck Berry\u2019s \u201cJohnny B. Goode.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Several older delegates I spoke to conceded that they were enjoying themselves but that the convention didn\u2019t mean anything, at least not the way it did when no one knew who the nominee would be on the first day, let alone March. So why bother?</span></p> <p><span>To advance a platform? Even after his speech Thursday night, Kerry was relying on vague generalities and has yet to set forth a concrete exit strategy for Iraq or handling the war against terror.</span></p> <p><span>To rally support for the party\u2019s cause? That\u2019s the stuff of commercials, not nationally broadcast four-day indoctrination campaigns.</span></p> <p><span>To hear Bill Clinton speak?</span></p> <p><span>Well, maybe. But next time, don\u2019t send me.</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff writer Timothy J. McGinn can be reached at mcginn@fas.harvard.edu.</i></span></p>"}

His speech addressed why he is running for president and what is wrong with U.S. politics.</span></p> <p><span>Nader\u2019s loudest complaint was that the creeping increase of corporate influence in government is turning the United States into a de facto dictatorship.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe two major parties are running this country into the ground for corporate campaign contributions,\u201d Nader said. \u201cGeorge W. Bush is a giant corporation disguised as a human being residing in the White House, and his administration was marinated in oil.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Nader\u2019s ridiculing of his incumbent opponent drew loud roars from the fiercely anti-Bush attendees, many of whom were lured inside the rally by a demonstrator on the plaza outside the Science Center, where a disgruntled old man, crowned by multi-colored balloons, yelled \u201cFuck Bush!\u201d to help publicize the rally.</span></p> <p><span>But in addition to criticizing the Bush administration, Nader marshaled evidence that Sen. John F.

{"title": "'Wealthy' Protesters Make Case Outside DNC | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Simon W. Vozick-levinson", "body": "<p><span>BOSTON\u2014As the nation\u2019s top Democrats put on their rigorously on-message pageant in Boston this week, a wide variety of protesters gathered intermittently to pound out their own slogans in the environs of the FleetCenter. Some, scorning the Party faithful who gathered nearby, urged passersby to trust President Bush at all costs; others used the convention as an opportunity to launch a fiercer brand of anti-administration rhetoric than might have been allowed on the upbeat stage, lacing their words with righteous condemnation and the occasional expletive.</span></p> <p><span>And then, as former Vice President Al Gore \u201969 might put it, there was that little-known third category.</span></p> <p><span>Taken at face value, the Billionaires for Bush certainly seem to fit in with those booing yesterday\u2019s nomination of Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., from afar. Ask any of them about recent trends in domestic and foreign policy and they will coo rapturous praise for the White House\u2019s current occupant. And his opponent?</span></p> <p><span>\u201cJohn Kerry is a class-traitor who wants nothing more than to scrap the incredible progress our nation has made over the last four years and return America to the grubby hands of the unwashed middle-class masses,\u201d read a call to arms posted recently on the Billionaires\u2019 website. \u201cIt is our sacred duty as guardians of privilege and power to defend the Bush administration from this barbaric electoral challenge. We therefore call upon all loyal People of Wealth to defy the Democratic National Convention and converge on the streets of Boston for a Million Billionaire March on July 27.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>And converge they did\u2014150 of them, according to those who attended\u2014to take back the streets for the silver-spoon set and present a symbolic check in the amount of \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to the local GOP headquarters. Dressed nattily, traveling by limousine whenever possible, courting the camera\u2019s admiring gaze, the average Billionaire could easily be taken by a casual observer for a particularly attention-hungry, slightly mad arch-paleocon.</span></p> <p><span>But look a little closer: Don\u2019t those names\u2014Seymour Benjamins, Mo Bludfer-Oyle, Mona Polist\u2014sound a bit off? Isn\u2019t there the hint of a grin beneath their solidly plutocratic exteriors? And was that check a symbol or a big gag?</span></p> <p><span>The truth of the matter is, as hard as they try to keep in character (and they try pretty hard), the Billionaires are only ironically for Bush. Far from being the obscenely wealthy\u2019s first explicit lobbying group, they are a particularly meta feather in the left wing, seeking to present the excesses of the Bush administration with jokey, street-theatre tactics powered by firm liberalism. Adopting outsize Bush-loving personas, the Billionaires spout often-scripted lines about what they say\u2014well, heavily imply\u2014is a president who has catered dangerously to the top wealth brackets.</span></p> <p><span><b>BILLIONAIRES ON CAMPUS</b></span></p> <p><span>Their politics, then, may not be as far right or their pockets as swollen as their act would suggest. But several of the Billionaires are in fact part of another group traditionally caricatured, fair or unfair, as more than financially comfortable: Harvard affiliates.</span></p> <p><span>When the cameras turn away, \u201cSeymour Benjamins,\u201d the Billionaires\u2019 \u201cchief operating officer,\u201d is Matthew R. Skomarovsky \u201903, a veteran of the anti-war and living wage movements at the College. \u201cMona Polist,\u201d their director of campus outreach, is in fact Emma S. Mackinnon \u201905, also a longtime Harvard activist on the left and a Crimson editor. \u201cJohn McMillions\u201d differs by only a letter or two from the flesh-and-blood John C. McMillian, a history and literature tutor and resident tutor in Quincy House. And the eloquently-named \u201cMo Bludfer-Oyle\u201d is Jennifer Mason, an administrative coordinator at the Graduate School of Education, by day.</span></p> <p><span>As part of the growing group, they have helped stage publicity stunts including the Million Billionaire March with its check, various other theatrical displays, and the \u201cGet on the Limo Tour,\u201d launched here Wednesday, in which the Billionaires plan to crash political events in so-called Midwest swing states.</span></p> <p><span><b>MEETING WITH SUCCESS?</b></span></p> <p><span>Mason is confident that this week\u2019s march was \u201cdefinitely successful,\u201d citing a healthy turnout and media attention from the Fox News Channel and public radio station WBUR.</span></p> <p><span>When they got to the Republican headquarters with their physical carte blanche, Mason says the Billionaires didn\u2019t meet a particularly warm reception\u2014or, for that matter, with any reception at all.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere didn\u2019t seem to be anyone there,\u201d she recalls. \u201cApparently they work a nine-to-five work day, and we didn\u2019t get there until 7 or 7:30.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>As for the Democratic convention itself, Mason says the group has avoided the enclosed \u201cfree speech zones\u201d set up for protests immediately by the FleetCenter\u2014let alone going inside the building.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s been wise to skirt the pen,\u201d she says, explaining that the Billionaires instead sought a license and a police escort for their march, well outside the convention.</span></p> <p><span>Members agree, though, that the success of the Billionaires\u2019 campaign relies on few tangible convention-week results.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cTo be totally honest, it\u2019s more like just getting publicity,\u201d McMillian says of the group\u2019s events.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt was really more for show,\u201d Mason says about the abortive presentation of the mock check. \u201cA lot of what the Billionaires do\u2014it\u2019s funny, and it\u2019s pointing out the truth by being funny.... While we definitely do want to confront Democrats and Republicans, a lot of it is more drawing attention to these issues of class that are not being addressed.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Of course, the risks of taking a headily Swiftian approach to social protest are obvious: what if the joke, which is after all pretty serious, flies right past those in the audience?</span></p> <p><span>\u201cEvery once in a while you meet some people who actually think we\u2019re billionaires, and I guess that\u2019s not an example of a successful protest,\u201d McMillian says. \u201cBut 99 percent of the people got it.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><b>WHO THEY ARE</b></span></p> <p><span>The Billionaires themselves can be a bit fuzzy on their unironic identity when it goes beyond their talking points on class-based issues like health care, the minimum wage and war profiteering. Members are prohibited from explicitly endorsing any presidential candidate out of character\u2014and indeed, when the group was founded on a smaller level in 2000 it called itself \u201cBillionaires for Bush or Gore.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>These days their kill-him-with-kindness target has shrunken to Bush alone, and the Billionaires keep their punchlines to a tight list of issues. Their schtick mentions Kerry only in faux-negative terms, but Billionaires are not allowed to support the nominee seriously. What to do, then, with the four-day binge of Democratic boosterism that is the convention?</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe DNC has been an interesting event to try to plan, because we had to figure out what our message was going to be about John Kerry,\u201d Mason says.</span></p> <p><span>Things will be much clearer at next month\u2019s Republican National Convention in New York City, where the Billionaires\u2014just wrapping up their limo tour\u2014can jokily support Bush with no qualms.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s going to be much more of a celebration, and this is more of a protest,\u201d Mason explains.</span></p> <p><span>McMillian has more ominous words.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe Republican convention will be a totally different vibe,\u201d he says, alluding to a \u201chuge intimidating police presence\u201d that he says will watch over the enormous crowds of protestors expected to show up. \u201cThe emotional intensity will be ramped up by about a thousand percent.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>For the time being, McMillian is content to enjoy the Billionaires\u2019 activities in Boston.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cFrom my perspective, anything that gets people energized and makes protest fun is a good thing,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can still get a message across that\u2019s humorous and relevant, and people enjoy seeing us.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff writer Simon W.

Often, it seemed just being in the corridors abutting the floor of the Democratic National Convention (DNC) was enough. Certainly, it was enough to spur a healthy trade in the many-colored stiff paper passes which granted varying levels of convention access to their bearers.</span></p> <p><span>Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday had their share of distinguished speakers and high-profile attendees, to be sure. But the main event was last night, when everyone who was anyone would flock to the convention to see newly nominated Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., make his first appearance of the week.</span></p> <p><span>Or so they thought. In fact, as the FleetCenter filled to capacity, Boston\u2019s fire marshal ordered its doors shut last night more than an hour before Kerry took the stage. Delegates, special guests and reporters were barred from the DNC by police officers; and though a few VIPs talked their way in to catch for the nominee\u2019s speech, the vast majority were forced to depart and watch Kerry from a local watering hole\u2014or, for a lucky few gathered by one of the Center\u2019s entrances, to witness an impromptu rendition of the candidate\u2019s remarks by a foul-mouthed canine puppet.</span></p> <p><span><b>\u2018BULLSHIT\u2019</b></span></p> <p><span>At 9 p.m., the streets outside the FleetCenter were a bedlam, exiled pols mingling with the protesters who hadn\u2019t made it into the free speech zones.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cNo, I have the VIP pass and I can\u2019t get in at all!\u201d one well-dressed man indignantly spoke into a cellphone headset.</span></p> <p><span>Although those bearing passes marked \u201cPress\u201d were allowed within the security barrier surrounding the convention center\u2014a privilege not granted many with passes reading \u201cHonored Guest,\u201d \u201cSpecial Guest\u201d or even \u201cDelegate\u201d\u2014by a few minutes after 9 p.m. it became clear that none were getting inside the FleetCenter itself.</span></p> <p><span>One Wisconsin delegate, riding the T dejectedly after being turned away from the convention at 7:45 p.m., said she felt her contributions to the party\u2019s work had been unappreciated.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI\u2019m a little pissed off,\u201d said the delegate, who said she had been admitted to the convention for its first three days. \u201cNo, I\u2019m totally pissed off actually.

The doors opened more than once, but only to let ejected convention-goers out, not to let anyone new in. One staffer could be heard lamenting that her belongings had been left upstairs at the convention.</span></p> <p><span>At about 9:30 p.m., a siren went off for a moment, quickly interrupted and replaced by the megaphoned voice of a police officer saying that the fire marshal had closed off the convention for the night. All hopes seemed to be dashed\u2014and then a heavily accented voice rose over the hum of the crowd, and a rubber dog puppet rose over its heads.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s America!\u201d shouted Robert Smigel, the man with his hand up the rear end of Triumph the Insult Comic Dog.</span></p> <p><span>The character of Triumph, the profane Don Rickles of the kennel set, has long been performed by \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d scribe Smigel on the late-night show of Conan O\u2019Brien \u201985. Last night, Smigel was accompanied by a man bearing a large, expensive-looking video camera as he addressed the crowd.</span></p> <p><span>Alleging that only Alan Colmes, the nominally liberal half of Fox News Channel duo Hannity and Colmes, had been allowed into the center, Triumph let loose.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cGet in there and get your butt kicked by Hannity,\u201d the Smigel-voiced puppet barked. \u201cThank God they just let the doormat through the door!\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The impromptu performance, it would soon be revealed, was not for Conan\u2014it was for a potential Triumph movie, following up on the mangy mouth\u2019s 2003 album, Come Poop With Me.</span></p> <p><span>Within moments, Smigel had whipped out a pre-printed transcript of the keynote remarks Kerry would deliver in less than an hour inside the convention. He then began to read them in Triumph\u2019s embittered voice, holding the puppet high all the while and interspersing Kerry high notes with a few Borscht Belt punchlines of his own.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI want to address these words directly to President George W. Bush,\u201d Triumph read from Kerry\u2019s speech. But where the candidate went on to call for optimism in the campaign ahead, Triumph howled, \u201cAre you out there, bitch?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>At another point, reciting Kerry\u2019s reference to \u201cthe next great chapter\u201d in American history, Triumph broke out his trademark line.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cA great chapter,\u201d he repeated. \u201c...For me to poop on!\u201d</span></p> <p><span>At times the dog appeared to mock Kerry\u2019s speech, shouting \u201cBoooooring!\u201d before quickly adding that he was only trying to portray what he thought the audience\u2019s reaction would be. But Triumph, who has based much of his act on picking fights with flesh-and-blood celebrities, said he stood by the candidate.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cStop\u2014these are John Kerry\u2019s words,\u201d the mutt said solemnly when those around him began to chant the name \u201cTriumph.\u201d \u201cThis is no Al Sharpton showboating.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Triumph also made frequent reference to what he perceived as his onlookers\u2019 inadequate show of appreciation for his jokes.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI hope you appreciate this,\u201d he said at one point, turning to the police who watched with bemusement. \u201cI\u2019m trying to disperse the crowd.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>After concluding Triumph\u2019s version of Kerry\u2019s speech\u2014much of which he skipped\u2014Smigel revealed another puppet, this one of a sternly frowning owl.</span></p> <p><span>Explaining that the rubber bird represented would-be first lady Teresa Heinz Kerry, Smigel enacted a quick kiss between the puppets.</span></p> <p><span>At last, Triumph led those who had been locked out in a rousing round of \u201cGod Bless America.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>And like that, with a few brief answers to questions posed by the media gathered by the FleetCenter\u2019s entrance\u2014including to one who asked Smigel who he was\u2014he was gone.</span></p> <p><span><b>UNDERCOVER</b></span></p> <p><span>Finally, as those kept out of the convention made their way out past the black metal barriers around the FleetCenter, some were met by the oddest sight yet\u2014a red, white and blue bandana-wearing man shouting \u201cWin with Dean! Lose with Kerry! Draft Dean!\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cYou know you want Dean,\u201d the hand-written placard he carried read, referring to the former Vermont governor whose initially promising bid for the Democratic nomination swiftly disintegrated after the first primaries in January and February. \u201cKerry\u2019s a loser.\u201dBut asked about his purpose, Bob Barrett, 36, of Lynnfield, Mass., slid the first sign away to let another show.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cW kicks terrorist ass!\u201d the second placard screamed.</span></p> <p><span>Revealing quietly that he was in fact a self-proclaimed \u201cmember of the vast right-wing conspiracy,\u201d Barrett explained his covert op.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to do is get Democrats to walk away feeling really bad about their candidate,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Stephen M.

Dean opened the Campaign for America\u2019s Future \u201cTake Back America\u201d speaker series at the Royal Sonesta Hotel in Cambridge Tuesday, focusing on building a progressive base for the future.</span></p> <p><span>Dean, an early frontrunner for the Democratic nomination for president last fall, was one of the headliners of an event meant to rally progressive liberals in support of Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., who was formally made the party\u2019s nominee in Boston this week.</span></p> <p><span>Dean began his half-hour speech\u2014the first of the afternoon\u2019s agenda, which lasted over three hours\u2014by mocking his concession address after the Iowa caucus earlier this year. After that enthusiastic January speech, in which Dean recited a list of states he vowed to visit and then let out a scream, the then-candidate slipped rapidly in the polls, leading many pundits to speculate that it had turned voters off to Dean.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cYou know what\u2019s coming next, right?\u201d Dean said to his audience Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna win in Michigan, we\u2019re gonna win in Iowa.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But rather than focus on the past, Dean centered his speech on what he identified as the need not only to elect a Democratic president, but also to build a solid base of progressives for the future.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to talk about how to rebuild this country after four devastating years,\u201d Dean said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe\u2019re going to make sure that we progress back to the America that represents the best for all Americans,\u201d Dean added later, prompting one of several standing ovations.</span></p> <p><span>Although Dean faulted the Bush administration for most of the country\u2019s ills, he also admonished liberals for not opposing Bush strongly enough.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere are two other groups that are responsible for what George Bush is doing to the country,\u201d Dean said. \u201cOne is the Democratic Party for not standing up to George Bush three years ago. The other is us.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Dean said 50 percent of Americans do not vote in national elections, adding that increased voter participation could help oust Bush from office.</span></p> <p><span>But Dean said voting in this election was not enough to sustain the Democratic Party. He called on attendees to energize and expand the Democratic base not only by voting in elections, but also by running for office themselves.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe way you win presidential elections is to take care of local elections first,\u201d Dean said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cPolitics is too important to be left to the politicians,\u201d Dean added. \u201cWe need your help.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Having capable and progressive people run for offices like school board member would make a positive contribution to the Democratic base, Dean said. People would feel more involved in the party if participation in government started from the grassroots level, he said.</span></p> <p><span>Dean said those burdened just to make ends meet and without time to run for office should dedicate three hours per week to helping a political campaign and should try to make small donations.</span></p> <p><span>Democrats also need to learn from the success of Republicans in winning control of Congress in 1994 and contest all congressional seats, beginning with the upcoming elections, Dean said.</span></p> <p><span>In that vein, Dean also said the Democratic Party needed to extend its scope so that it could one day hope to win elections in states like Mississippi and Alabama that have voted solidly Republican in recent decades.</span></p> <p><span>He said the Democratic Party could expand because it could work to satisfy the four basic desires of the vast majority of the country: jobs that pay well, health insurance for themselves and particularly for their children, strong public school education and a strong and ethical national security policy.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIn Mississippi, 95 percent of the people care about the same things they do in Massachusetts and in New York,\u201d Dean said.</span></p> <p><span>Dean urged the Democratic Party to begin campaigning seriously in the Deep South and in other Western states now, even if the party\u2019s labor might not bear fruit in the immediate future.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cSooner or later, people in those parts of the country will get tired of voting on God, guns and gays and start voting on education and health care,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to send a progressive message to stop being afraid to Utah, Texas, Idaho and Alabama.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Dean also bucked the wishes of the Kerry campaign by lambasting the Bush administration.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cYou can\u2019t call the president a fascist,\u201d Dean said in a sarcastic tone.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe\u2019re not doing that this week, anyway,\u201d he added while suppressing a false cough.</span></p> <p><span>Later, when his microphone suffered a temporary malfunction, Dean implied that senior Bush advisor Karl Rove was spying on the speech.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cObviously, Karl Rove has control of the microphone. Karl, are you here?\u201d Dean said. \u201cNo\u2014I guess it\u2019s somebody in the White House doing that.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Dean also insulted the Boston Herald for its coverage of Teresa Heinz Kerry, the Democratic candidate\u2019s wife. Earlier this week, Heinz Kerry clashed with a reporter, urging him to \u201cshove it,\u201d after a sharp question.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cDid anyone see the Boston Herald this morning? My God\u2014it\u2019s the next thing to the National Enquirer,\u201d Dean said. \u201cYou know what? Kerry\u2019s going to win this election because of his wife.

Michael!\u201d erupted as event organizers, who first shuffled the order of several other speakers, were eventually reduced to stalling by listing the names of liberal websites while Moore used the rest room before his speech.</span></p> <p><span>When Moore finally arrived, well over an hour late, he wasted no time in berating the mass media.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe obvious bad guy in [Fahrenheit 9/11] is George W. Bush. But there\u2019s the unstated villain in the film, which is the national media,\u201d he said. \u201cIt outs them as people who are cheerleaders to this war. It outs them as journalists who fell asleep on the job, journalists who didn\u2019t ask the tough questions.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Moore said members of the news media would have been patriotic to question the Bush administration, rather than succumb to pressure from the White House.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cTo the members of the press in the audience: We need you to do your jobs,\u201d Moore said, prompting an ovation. \u201cYou do us no service by hopping on a bandwagon.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cYou can ask any question you want and not get arrested,\u201d Moore continued. \u201cSo what has prevented you from asking the questions?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Moore said that he heard this week from a prominent talk show host who was admonished by Vice President Dick Cheney\u2019s office for using an unfavorable tone while discussing the Iraq invasion. Moore pledged to tell the TV host\u2019s story by the end of the week on his website if that host did not come forward.</span></p> <p><span>Referring to the media\u2019s war coverage, Moore added, \u201cYou haven\u2019t just been embedded. You\u2019ve been in bed with the wrong people.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>After finishing up his assault on the media, Moore said he thought high voter turnout could lead to a presidential win for Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI believe we will have the largest percentage of people voting in our lifetime on November 2,\u201d Moore said.</span></p> <p><span>Moore\u2014who said the country is not in fact evenly ideologically divided, but liberal\u2014said the increased voter turnout would help Democrats.</span></p> <p><span>Moore even predicted that \u201cgood Republicans\u201d might launch a Republicans for Kerry movement to protest Bush administration policies.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe good news is things are going to change soon,\u201d Moore said.</span></p> <p><span>Moore said he did not blame Kerry for voting to go to war in Iraq because he said Kerry was misled by Bush to believe that Iraq posed an imminent threat.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cOne thing I do know about Kerry\u2014he will not invade a country the way Bush did,\u201d Moore said.</span></p> <p><span>Although Moore did not spend much time praising Kerry, he said he opposed the efforts of independent candidate Ralph Nader and those considering voting for him. Many political analysts believe that left-wing support for Nader contributed to the electoral defeat former Vice President Al Gore \u201969 suffered in 2000 and could do the same to Kerry this year.</span></p> <p><span>Moore said Nader already accomplished his goal of pushing the Democratic Party to the left after 2000. This year, liberals should unite behind the goal of voting Bush out of the presidency, Moore said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMy appeal to the Nader voters is we have a different job to do this year,\u201d Moore said.</span></p> <p><span>But Moore added, \u201cWe need to give those who are thinking of voting for Nader a reason to vote for John Kerry.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Moore urged the Democratic candidate to take tough and principled stands, lest he lose votes to Nader and cause apathy among the public.</span></p> <p><span>Throughout his speech, Moore also continued his trend of attacking the Bush presidency and its supporters, labeling them unpatriotic.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThey\u2019re not patriots\u2014they\u2019re hate-triots, and they believe in the politics of hate-triotism,\u201d Moore said to a somewhat befuddled audience.</span></p> <p><span>Moore also attacked the war in Iraq.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe way you don\u2019t support the troops is to send them into harm\u2019s way when it isn\u2019t necessary,\u201d Moore said.</span></p> <p><span>Moore wrapped up his critiques by making fun of an incident in which Bush was hospitalized after choking on a pretzel.</span></p> <p><span>Moore said NASCAR star Dale Earnhardt Jr. advised all Americans on national television to watch Fahrenheit 9/11.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI said a little prayer for George W.

{"title": "Clinton, Porter Trade Sharp Jabs | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Hours after his address to the Democratic National Convention, Bill Clinton was back on the offensive, flatly dismissing allegations that his recently published autobiography included a fabricated account of a conversation  with Kennedy School of Government professor Roger B. Porter.</span></p> <p><span>In an exclusive interview in Cambridge early Tuesday morning, Clinton told The Crimson that Porter\u2019s claims about the book, My Life, were simply \u201cnot true.\u201d But, despite the hour, Porter wasted little time answering right back, sharpening his criticisms of Clinton\u2019s account and expanding their scope.</span></p> <p><span>Clinton had written in his memoir that Porter, who was Economic and Domestic Policy Adviser under President George H. W. Bush, had fired a warning shot at him.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHere\u2019s how Washington works,\u201d Clinton quoted Porter as saying in My Life. \u201cThe press has to have somebody and we\u2019re going to give them you...We\u2019ll spend whatever we have to spend to get whoever we have to get to say whatever they have to say to take you out. And we\u2019ll do it early.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In June, after the autobiography was released, Porter said Clinton\u2019s account was untrue, a charge the former president rebutted this morning.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cYou don\u2019t forget something like that,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cJust think about it. I wouldn\u2019t make something like that up.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But Porter scoffed when told of Clinton\u2019s reply, noting that he would certainly remember so important an exchange.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhy would anybody believe him?\u201d Porter told The Crimson early Tuesday morning. \u201cHe is absolutely correct that I would not have forgotten a conversation like that, and that just buttresses my claim that such a conversation never took place.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In his book, Clinton cited the exchange as one of the primary motivating factors behind his first presidential run in 1992. Though he was comfortably situated in Arkansas at the time and hesitant to abandon his position, Clinton wrote, a telephone call from Porter \u201cshowed what was wrong with [George H. W. Bush\u2019s] administration.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>According to Clinton\u2019s book, Porter\u2014who is Dunster House Master and IBM professor of business and government\u2014said that while other potential Democratic opponents could be undermined through weaknesses grounded in their politics, the Arkansas governor\u2019s voting record made him \u201cdifferent.\u201d According to Clinton, this also made him a prime candidate for a Republican-orchestrated smear campaign.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cSubsequent events sort of confirmed that,\u201d Clinton said early Tuesday morning, referring to the scandals that plagued his second term of office. \u201cWhen [the call] happened, I respected it, but I didn\u2019t fold.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Clinton cited conversations he had immediately after the phone call to support his version of the account.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAs soon as I hung up the phone, I called Hillary,\u201d Clinton said Tuesday morning, \u201cand then I called Mack McLarty,\u201d his future chief of staff.</span></p> <p><span>But Porter told The Crimson in June that the only conversation he can recall with the Arkansas governor came during President Bush\u2019s 1989 Education Summit with the Governors, where he joked with Clinton about how the rising politician ought to run for president in much the same fashion as Ronald Reagan\u2014as a Republican.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe never had any conversation as he has described in his book,\u201d Porter said in June. \u201cYou don\u2019t remember every conversation in life, but I would certainly remember a conversation like that.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Porter pointed to \u201ctell-tale\u201d signals within the purported dialogue as confirming his version of the account, singling out the use of the word \u201ccrap\u201d in the account. Clinton wrote that Porter broke off a policy conversation with \u201cCut the crap, Governor,\u201d before the alleged threat.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s not the way I talk,\u201d Porter said in June, \u201cand anybody who\u2019s been around me knows that\u2019s not the way I talk.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Porter also rejected the possibility that anyone in George H. W. Bush\u2019s administration would make such a call, stating that discussions of character attacks on Clinton never took place during any of the meetings he attended or was aware of during his time at the White House.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThat was not President Bush\u2019s style or that of those who worked for him,\u201d Porter said in June.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt gives me no particular pleasure to set the historical record straight,\u201d he read Tuesday morning from a prepared statement. \u201cI do so for two reasons. First, historians and scholars of the presidency deserve to base their judgments and assessments on facts. Bill Clinton was not propelled, as he claims, into running for president in 1992 in part because he was courageous in responding to threats he received from me or from anyone else. Second, our political system needs more trust and less cynicism...Fabricating stories does not contribute to building the trust that is so needed.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Clinton\u2019s allegations initially surfaced during his first term in office, when Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward learned of the account.</span></p> <p><span>According to the June 23, 2004 edition of the White House Bulletin, provided by Porter to The Crimson, Woodward stated that he did not think Clinton\u2019s assertion about Porter making the threat was credible enough to be included in his 1994 book The Agenda, which he was then working on.</span></p> <p><span>\u201c[It] sounds like someone from \u2018The Sopranos,\u2019\u201d Woodward told the Bulletin. \u201cIt\u2019s an apocryphal story.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>And while Porter agreed that is all Clinton\u2019s version of the events amounts to, he was not quite so quick to dismiss its effects.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think he diminishes the office of the president, which I treasure, when he repeatedly lies,\u201d said Porter Tuesday morning. \u201cAnd I think he ought to be ashamed of himself.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Porter teaches the popular course Government 1540: \u201cThe American Presidency.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Clinton accused Porter of deviating from his initial account of what had transpired, claiming that his version had evolved from a difference over details to a flat-out denial.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhen they first asked Roger Porter about it, he didn\u2019t say it didn\u2019t happen,\u201d Clinton said this morning. \u201cHe just said, \u2018It didn\u2019t happen that way.\u2019\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But according to Porter, who was first confronted with the charges by Woodward, his story has remained the same over the course of a decade.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe\u2019s lying,\u201d Porter said Tuesday morning. \u201cI have never changed my account of this one whit.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>According to Clinton, neither he nor Porter has attempted to contact the other since the purported incident.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI never heard from or saw Roger Porter again until he attended a reception for White House Fellows when I was President,\u201d Clinton wrote. \u201cI wonder if he ever thinks about that phone call and whether it influenced my decision.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Clinton reiterated Tuesday morning that neither he nor Porter has contacted the other since the incident, prompting chuckles from his supposed antagonist.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI talked to him the day before his book came out,\u201d Porter said Tuesday morning. \u201cI had a brief conversation with him at the White House portrait ceremony,\u201d on June 14, 2004.</span></p> <p><span>Neither Clinton nor Porter would speculate as to the other\u2019s motives in falsifying his account.</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff writer Timothy J.

{"title": "Obama Stars at Convention | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>BOSTON\u2014\u201cWhat is Obama Barack?\u201d a well-shaven man in a pinstriped suit asked me in the hall of the FleetCenter early Wednesday evening. \u201cEveryone\u2019s carrying signs for it,\u201d he added.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt is not Obama Barack,\u201d I replied, \u201cbut he is Barack Obama.\u201d And since his smash-hit keynote speech Tuesday night, nobody is asking who Barack Obama\u2014or Obama Barack\u2014is anymore.</span></p> <p><span>The national media has unanimously dubbed Obama, half white, half black, the new star of the party. In his keynote address Tuesday night, Obama told audiences that the American Dream can be a reality, but also that \u201cwe have real enemies in the world\u201d that must be \u201cpursued\u2014and they must be defeated.  John Kerry knows this.\u201d He criticized Bush\u2019s policies in the speech, but never attacked the president by name.</span></p> <p><span>Arriving at the convention as an unknown, he leaves a rising star, ready to win the Democrat\u2019s nomination for the open U.S. Senate seat in Illinois.</span></p> <p><span>Sen. Jon S. Corzine, D-N.J., called Obama \u201cthe epitome of the future of what America\u2019s about\u201d in an exclusive with The Crimson on Tuesday.</span></p> <p><span>Obama\u2019s speech began on an autobiographical note. Describing his father\u2019s humble beginnings in Kenya as a goat herder and his grandfather\u2019s ambitious dreams, Obama shared his own experiences with hardship as an example to the American people that \u201ca brighter day will come.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Obama himself has already had many bright days. At 42, he is already an accomplished state senator and an instructor at the University of Chicago Law School.  A graduate of Columbia University and Harvard Law School, Obama is as well-educated as they come.</span></p> <p><span>But when Obama reached the autobiographical portion of his speech Tuesday night, he had two opportunities to mention Harvard, in the context of both himself and his father, who left the family to pursue his Ph.D. at Harvard. But instead, Obama steered clear of the H-Bomb: \u201cThrough hard work and perseverance my father got a scholarship to study in a magical place, America.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Kirkand and Ellis Professor of Law David B. Wilkins, who knew both Obama and his wife Michelle when they were at the Law School, said yesterday that he wasn\u2019t surprised Obama didn\u2019t mention his Harvard background in his address.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMost politicians who have Harvard in their background, well, let\u2019s just say that they approach their relationship in their speeches with caution,\u201d Wilkins said. \u201cIt is the kind of thing that always gets mentioned by the press, but not by the candidate.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>A political science major at Columbia, Obama spent five years after college working as a community organizer with black churches in both Harlem and Chicago before enrolling at Harvard Law School, where he made national headlines as the first African-American president of the Harvard Law Review.</span></p> <p><span>In February of 1990, the Associated Press ran an article saying that Obama told them that he would \u201clike to someday return to community work, and has not ruled out a future in politics.\u201d  The Los Angeles Times ran a story in March of that same year in which Obama was quoted as saying that he planned to run for public office sometime \u201cdown the road.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In a Boston Globe story that ran in February 1990, John Owens, Obama\u2019s former co-worker from Chicago, was quoted in a telephone interview: \u201cThis guy sounds like he\u2019s president of the country already,\u201d Owens said of Obama. \u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone who could leave that impression after only five minutes.\u2019\u201d</span></p> <p><span>A champion of \u201ccore values that unite Americans,\u201d Obama possesses a biracial appeal that has been said to have drawn widespread support in the Illinois Democratic primary, in which he garnered 53 percent of the vote in an election with six other candidates.</span></p> <p><span>One of Obama\u2019s most striking political strengths is his ability to draw support from even those who disagree with him. And it seems his ability to unite those who usually agree to disagree has always been with him. In March 1990, the Los Angeles Times ran a feature piece on Obama that pointed to this.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cYet some of Obama\u2019s peers...find it puzzling that despite Obama\u2019s openly progressive views on social issues, he has also won support from staunch conservatives,\u201d the piece read. \u201cIronically, he has come under the most criticism from fellow black students for being too conciliatory toward conservatives and not choosing more blacks to other top positions on the law review.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The article quoted Christine Lee, a black second-year HLS student at the time: \u201cHe\u2019s willing to talk to them [the conservatives] and he has a grasp of where they are coming from, which is something a lot of blacks don\u2019t have and don\u2019t care to have.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Even as president of the Law Review, Obama was a talented politician. In the same article, Obama\u2019s constitutional law professor, Laurence H. Tribe \u201962, was quoted: \u201cHe\u2019s very unusual, in the sense that other students who might have something approximating his degree of insight are very intimidating to other students or inconsiderate and thoughtless....He\u2019s able to build upon what other students say and see what\u2019s valuable in their comments without belittling them.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>He turned down opportunities to clerk for the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the D. C. circuit to work in civil rights law back in Chicago.</span></p> <p><span>Wilkins, who remembers Obama as \u201ca super star\u201d even back in his law school days, said it was \u201cvery clear even in his student days that Obama\u2019s first love was politics at the grassroots level.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Wilkins recalls talking with Obama when he was a third-year about clerkships in the Supreme Court.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI encouraged him to apply because I knew he\u2019d get one, and he said he wasn\u2019t interested, that he wanted to go back to Illinois and get involved in politics instead,\u201d Wilkins said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe\u2019s the kind of person that has always known what he wanted,\u201d he added. \u201cHe really knows how to get things done.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Bloomberg Professor of Law Martha L. Minow, who taught Obama during his time at the Law School, recalls that he always had his mind set on the community, not on the Supreme Court.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe was very clear that he wanted to return to the issues he had handled as a community organizer in Chicago,\u201d she wrote in an e-mail.</span></p> <p><span>Minow recently worked with Obama on a two-year project run out of the Kennedy School of Government that produced a report called \u201cBetter Together,\u201d which examined and identified efforts to strengthen bonds within communities and democracies.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cBarack impressed every participant\u201d working on the project, Minow wrote, \u201cand indeed, we all pledged to support his campaign for President of the United States.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe tried it laugh it off,\u201d she added, \u201cbut we were serious\u2014and rightly so.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Wilkins also remembers that Obama\u2019s talents as a speaker developed early on.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI remember listening to him,\u201d Wilkins said, \u201cwhen we were both speaking at some event for the Black Law Students Association. His speech wasn\u2019t quite as good as the one he gave last night, but it was just mesmerizing.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cYou could just tell that people were going to listen to this person, that they were going to follow him. He had this kind of calm about him that is quite remarkable for someone his age,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>That kind of calm has carried him through numerous political victories\u2014and might help him if he runs with Hillary Clinton in 2008, as some have speculated might happen if President Bush wins reelection in 2004.</span></p> <p><span>Obama also possesses a formidable intellect.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe\u2019s extremely smart,\u201d Wilkins said.  \u201cI was talking to Larry Tribe the other day, for whom Obama was a research assistant. Tribe had a mathematical background in college, but when they worked together on a paper on the theoretical application of mathematics to law, Larry said he was blown away by Barack\u2019s theoretical intelligence.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>After graduating from HLS, Obama pursued opportunities both in the public and academic sectors. He worked as a civil rights lawyer in Chicago, fighting against employment and housing discrimination and working on voting-rights legislation with a small firm.</span></p> <p><span>He also landed a post at the University of Chicago Law School, although he did not pursue a professorship, choosing to focus instead on politics\u2014his first love.</span></p> <p><span>Minow taught Obama in a course called \u201cLaw and Society.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>She remembers that Obama wrote his paper on \u201cissues relating to individualism and community, resonant with his key-note address.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Minow recalls Obama as a tremendously good leader of the Law Review.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe ushered in an era of calm, harmonious professionalism and still  found time to participate in reading groups and other student activities,\u201d she wrote.</span></p> <p><span>Wilkins added that classmates in Obama\u2019s section \u201ccommonly thought of him as the most talented person in the section. People talked about him being on the national ticket even back then.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe only thing that people saw barring him,\u201d Wilkins added, \u201cwas that nobody thought that you could have a name like that on the national ticket.  But look at him now. It\u2019s a name that you don\u2019t forget.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Even Dean of the Law School Elena Kagan came into Boston to see her \u201cgreat alumnus\u201d speak at the convention on Tuesday night.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt was kind of like watching a star being born,\u201d Kagan said, recalling Obama\u2019s address. Kagan, who graduated from HLS just four years before Obama, said she knows the state senator \u201cquite well.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Kagan was a professor at the University of Chicago law school when Obama taught there as an adjunct professor.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe\u2019s as fantastic in person as he seems,\u201d she said.  \u201cA truly extraordinary person: brilliant, magnetic, and humble.  The sky\u2019s the limit for him.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><b>OBAMA IN POLITICS</b></span></p> <p><span>Obama became a state senator in Illinois in 1997. In 2000, he had a career low point, when he lost a race against Bobby Rush for U.S. Congress. Rush, a former Black Panther, ran as the incumbent, and many in the black community didn\u2019t find Obama\u2019s biracial heritage appealing.</span></p> <p><span>But Obama\u2019s likely victory for the U.S. Senate this fall could push the Democrats into control of the Senate.</span></p> <p><span>Obama\u2019s parents met as students at the University of Hawaii. His father, who shares his exotic and unusual name, moved back to Kenya, where he worked as a successful economist during Obama\u2019s childhood. His mother, who is white and from Kansas, moved the family to Honolulu, where she raised Obama with her parents. Obama\u2019s mother remarried an Indonesian oil manager, and the family moved to Jakarta for four years.</span></p> <p><span>When he was 10 years old, Obama moved back to Hawaii, where he was raised primarily by his grandparents in a small apartment. His grandfather worked as a salesman and then an insurance agent, his grandmother at a bank.</span></p> <p><span>Encountering academic success early on, Obama got himself into one of Hawaii\u2019s top private schools, the Punahou School.</span></p> <p><span>And though Obama saw his father only once during his childhood\u2014he visited when Obama was 10 years old\u2014he wrote a memoir about the father he never knew, entitled \u201cDreams From My Father,\u201d in which he discusses his hybrid background and his teenage experimentation with marijuana and cocaine.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI guess you\u2019d have to say I wasn\u2019t a politician when I wrote the book,\u201d Obama told New Yorker writer William Finnegan in May. \u201cI wanted to show how and why some kids, maybe especially young black men, flirt with danger and self-destruction.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Simon W.

{"title": "Adventures in Mid- to High Society | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>NEW YORK\u2014I spent a week as a society reporter for The New York Sun, where I\u2019m interning this summer. My dishy diary follows:</span></p> <p><span><i>Wednesday</i></span></p> <p><span>I attend a very fancy charity ball held at the opulent Pierre hotel (61st and 5th Avenue). Amid an Athenian interior (complete with wall-size paintings depicting leisurely Greek life) I make my way through a packed ballroom of record executives, rising starlets, a parade of publicists and assorted hangers-on\u2014including a paralegal named (I am not making this up) <b>Jennifer Justice</b>.</span></p> <p><span>I spot <b>Denise Rich</b>, noted songwriter, socialite, philanthropist and ex-wife of Clinton pardonee <b>Marc Rich</b>. We chat for a few minutes; she\u2019s wearing a solid gold coin around her neck that keeps distracting me. Next up is the jazz singer <b>Anita Baker</b>, who performs a soulful tune for the enthusiastic audience. I interview later about her musical childhood. Lastly I meet a few New York gossip columnists, and then generally stare in awe at the blinding light of superficiality and wealth. Honestly, these \u201ccharity\u201d gatherings (this one is raising money to provide music programs for underprivileged kids) are an excuse for the rich to get moderately drunk together, talk about poor people and then give themselves awards. Hmm\u2014sounds a lot like a certain university I know\u2026</span></p> <p><span>Choice anecdote: The event organizers piled up mountains of sugary sweets for the guests to take home as they depart the hotel.  (I suppose this goes along with the whole \u201ckids\u201d theme.) I\u2019m taking in the sight of this big rock candy mountain (as it were) when some young folk from the Young People\u2019s Chorus of New York City, a children\u2019s choir that performed earlier at the event, run over to sample a few Fruit Roll-Ups.</span></p> <p><span>A thin, anxious <b>publicist</b> hurries over to the table. \u201cPlease don\u2019t take those!\u201d she yells at the kids, shooing them away. I suppose the tykes need a hand-up, not a hand-out\u2014but would the loss of a few <b>Dubble Bubbles</b> be so traumatic for an event whose sole ostensible purpose is to <i>help out needy children</i>?! The poor kids were probably exhausted from singing and just wanted something tasty for the ride home. The incident says wonders about who really benefits from a, um, benefit.</span></p> <p><span><i>Monday</i></span></p> <p><span>A book reading at Barnes &amp; Noble on the Upper West Side (81st and Broadway). The alliterative <i>Harper\u2019s</i> editor <b>Lewis Lapham</b> plugs his new laundry list of liberal laments, <i>Gag Rule</i>.</span></p> <p><span>The crowd is a mixed bag of eclectic amateur politicos and wealthy egotists; I\u2019m reminded of those Harvard Book Store readings and all the crazy Cantabrigians who invariably show up. Lapham warns of the oncoming end of democracy: \u201cIt\u2019s much easier to live in a monarchy,\u201d he intones. There is, however, an air of humor in his voice; I believe it stems from his happy knowledge that he\u2019ll be long dead before the country really starts falling apart. I find this unnerving.</span></p> <p><span>A few token conservatives in the back spice things up a little, sparring with Lapham over the late Ronald Reagan\u2019s popularity. The rest of the audience, a veritable Greek chorus of liberals, verbally rushes to defend its oracle.</span></p> <p><span>Some of the wannabe wonks in attendance accost me after the talk, launching into discussions about the Iraq crisis and Bush-Cheney corruption scandals. I use the word \u201cdiscussion\u201d lightly\u2014the conversations consist mostly of me listening to their 10-minute monologues. Occasionally I nod my head or release a murmur of approval from my parched throat; at least political discourse is alive and well. I refrain from purchasing the book, however.</span></p> <p><span><i>Tuesday</i></span></p> <p><span>A film premiere! Sadly, not <i>Catwoman</i>. This one is <i>Outfoxed</i>, a \u201cguerrilla\u201d (read: low-budget) documentary about the persistent conservative bias in Fox News Channel\u2019s coverage. A worthy cause indeed! Gathered at The New School\u2019s Tishman Auditorium (66 West 12th Street) is a smattering of pseudo-celebrities and political medium-wigs, here to take in the latest topical cinematic tirade.</span></p> <p><span>The evening begins amusingly, with an entertaining panel discussion on the state of the media. Editor of <i>The American Prospect</i> <b>Michael Tomasky</b> delivers the welcoming remarks: \u201cA special welcome to the News Corporation lawyers in the audience,\u201d he quips, referring to the potential lawsuit <b>Rupert Murdoch</b> will be filing against the documentary any day now. There are chuckles, followed by an outcry from the back of the room.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cFucking morons!\u201d yells <b>Al Franken \u201973</b>, presumably referring to the aforementioned legal types.</span></p> <p><span>Not missing a beat, one of the onstage panelists snarks back: \u201cIs Dick Cheney in the house?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>(The Cheney swipe may have been made by Dean of the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism, <b>Nicholas B. Lemann \u201976</b>, a former Crimson president. But I couldn\u2019t tell, sitting in the \u201cmedia only\u201d back row and all.)</span></p> <p><span>Franken might as well be referring to the American media. The theme of the event appears to be \u201cWhy are journalists such idiots?\u201d <b>Arianna Huffington</b>, she of the exotically ambiguous accent, suggests that American reporters need a \u201cspine transplant.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe Greeks gave you democracy and you screwed it up,\u201d Huffington huffs.</span></p> <p><span>After the movie, guests gather in the adjacent atrium for hors d\u2019oeuvres and drinks. The bartenders don\u2019t card\u2014lucky me. <b>Peggy \u201cJohn\u2019s Sister\u201d Kerry</b> hesitantly makes the rounds, looking confused as she speaks with prominent Democratic fundraisers and MoveOn.org execs. Apparently bewildered, Kerry sticks close to her guides, the late Sen. Daniel Moynihan\u2019s daughter <b>Maura Moynihan \u201979</b> and her curly-haired son. (I chat with Maura briefly; she\u2019s attractive, friendly, bordering on perky. It turns out she brings in lots of money for the Democratic Party, and even went to Harvard! Do you have a daughter, Ms. Moynihan?)</span></p> <p><span>Former Harvard history professor <b>Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. \u201938</b> is also in attendance, chatting with friends in his trademark red bow tie. Also present is filmmaker <b>D. A. Pennebaker</b>, co-director of the 1992 Clinton campaign documentary <i>The War Room</i>. Pennebaker made <b>James Carville</b> a star; I consider asking him to film me, but I think better of it.</span></p> <p><span>As I near the exit, I turn to watch the semi-celebrities down their last cocktails, finish munching on cookies, and trickle out into the humid Manhattan summer night. The premiere wasn\u2019t quite the glamorous gathering I\u2019d been expecting, but gallivanting with the jet set is fun while it lasts.</span></p> <p><span><i><b>Michael M.

{"title": "Ready To Serve | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Lauren A.E. Schuker", "body": "<p><span>BOSTON\u2014It was, by general consensus, the most important speech of John F. Kerry\u2019s life.</span></p> <p><span>Speaking to an over-capacity audience of loyal Democrats in the FleetCenter, the Massachusetts senator arrived on stage to accept his party\u2019s nomination for president. But his words were aimed further than the delegates assembled on the floor.</span></p> <p><span>As millions more watched the climax of the four-day Democratic National Convention (DNC) broadcast on television, Kerry was also making his case\u2014\u201chelp is on the way\u201d\u2014to the undecided voters who may well determine the outcome of the Nov. 2 presidential election.</span></p> <p><span>The nearly hour-long speech was in many ways familiar from stump speeches he delivered over the past year in a heated primary campaign. But in an effort to bring new life to his White House bid, Kerry also incorporated new themes\u2014including, early in his speech, a call to arms for the cause of women\u2019s rights\u2014and responded in unusually blunt fashion to criticisms of his policies and style that have accumulated over the course of his run.</span></p> <p><span>And after three days in which mentioning the name \u201cBush\u201d\u2014let alone openly attacking the current administration\u2014was strongly discouraged, Kerry proved himself unafraid to address the president directly and aggressively.</span></p> <p><span>While the FleetCenter\u2019s floor was erupting in applause and campaign signs, Harvard students watching the speech from the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum at the Institute of Politics overwhelmingly embraced Kerry\u2019s leaner, meaner message.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI was impressed by his tone\u2014he didn\u2019t sound too uptight,\u201d Y. Edo Paz \u201905 said. \u201cHe succeeded in having a truly personal demeanor.... I was impressed that he was able to pull off the most impressive speech of the convention after the great speeches of [former president Bill] Clinton on Monday and [Illinois senatorial candidate Barack] Obama on Tuesday.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Felipe C.L. Velasquez \u201905 was similarly impressed that Kerry could still hit home after four days of buildup.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI like how he was able to come off as the flagship of the Democratic Party,\u201d Velasquez said. \u201cThat\u2019s not easy with so many other luminaries.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>From the first words of his 10 p.m. keynote speech\u2014a gruff \u201cReporting for duty!\u201d\u2014Kerry emphasized what has been a defining theme of the convention and his campaign thus far. Alluding repeatedly to his now-familiar personal narrative that included service on a boat in the Mekong River during the Vietnam War\u2014and his subsequent opposition to the unjust war that it contributed to\u2014Kerry portrayed himself as a principled war hero wary of the dangers of armed conflict.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI know what kids go through when they are carrying an M-16 in a dangerous place and they can\u2019t tell friend from foe,\u201d Kerry said. \u201cI know what they go through when they\u2019re out on patrol at night and they don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming around the next bend. I know what it\u2019s like to write letters home telling your family that everything\u2019s all right when you\u2019re not sure that\u2019s true.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In a more fiery version of what has become one of his trademark moves, Kerry used his Vietnam experience as a platform on which to attack President Bush.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI will be a commander in chief who will never mislead us into war,\u201d Kerry said, going on to criticize the rest of the Bush administration in equally harsh terms, though just short of explicitly. \u201cI will have a vice president who will not conduct secret meetings with polluters to rewrite our environmental laws. I will have a secretary of defense who will listen to the best advice of our military leaders. And I will appoint an attorney general who actually upholds the Constitution of the United States.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>And striking a chord usually reserved for those further to the left than Kerry has portrayed himself during the campaign, the senator issued a scathing critique of Bush\u2019s energy policy and diplomacy.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI want an America that relies on its own ingenuity and innovation\u2014not the Saudi royal family,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Recent controversial works including Michael Moore\u2019s <i>Fahrenheit 9/11</i> and <i>House of Bush, House of Saud</i> by former Crimson editor Craig Unger \u201971 have focused national scrutiny on the current administration\u2019s cozy relationship with the Arab nation\u2019s rulers, but Kerry\u2019s more mainstream approach had previously steered clear of such territory.</span></p> <p><span>Toward the end of his remarks, Kerry tempered these salvos with a remarkably direct address to President Bush that still strove to avoid a negative tone, in keeping with the convention\u2019s general tenor of strength in cooperative unity.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI want to address these next words directly to President George W. Bush,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the weeks ahead, let\u2019s be optimists, not just opponents. Let\u2019s build unity in the American family, not angry division. Let\u2019s honor this nation\u2019s diversity; let\u2019s respect one another; and let\u2019s never misuse for political purposes the most precious document in American history, the Constitution of the United States.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The last sentence was Kerry\u2019s lone, particularly oblique reference to the Constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage proposed by Congressional Republicans and supported by President Bush. But even this came as something of a surprise in a week where the issue was largely invisible in major speeches.</span></p> <p><span>In describing his proposed policies on health care, labor, taxes and energy, Kerry showed an unsurprisingly populist attitude on issues involving class.</span></p> <p><span>Reciting a Clintonian litany of anecdotes about ordinary Americans struggling to make ends meet, Kerry offered solutions in the form of a simple refrain echoing Wednesday\u2019s speech by his running mate, Sen. John R. Edwards, D-N.C.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAmerica can do better,\u201d Kerry said over and over again. \u201cAnd help is on the way.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe can do better and we will,\u201d Kerry said at another point. \u201cWe\u2019re the optimists.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But when it came to his own life, the Yale-educated candidate was up-front about his privileged background\u2014mentioning that he grew up in a two-parent home, never having faced the economic challenges he vowed to address.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe story of people struggling for health care is the story of so many Americans,\u201d Kerry said. \u201cBut you know what, it\u2019s not the story of senators and members of Congress. Because we give ourselves great health care and you get the bill. Well, I\u2019m here to say, your family\u2019s health care is just as important as any politician\u2019s in Washington D.C.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The frank comparison of classes, recalling both the senator\u2019s own past rhetoric on the campaign trail and former president Bill Clinton\u2019s sharper digs at the Bush tax cuts on Monday night, countered criticism of Kerry as an aristocratic New England liberal.</span></p> <p><span>Kerry also met head-on Republican claims that his views on important issues have been inconsistent, suggesting that his evolving positions reflect an intellectual, detail-conscious approach.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cNow I know there are those who criticize me for seeing complexities\u2014and I do\u2014because some issues just aren\u2019t all that simple,\u201d Kerry said before turning those criticisms around on his opponent, who he implied has neglected the truth to stay on-message. \u201cSaying there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq doesn\u2019t make it so. Saying we can fight a war on the cheap doesn\u2019t make it so. And proclaiming, \u2018Mission accomplished\u2019 certainly doesn\u2019t make it so.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But for all his attacks on Bush, Kerry still spent a good deal of time at the podium striving to avoid the impression of partisanship.</span></p> <p><span>In one notable passage, Kerry discussed the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 in terms of the unity they engendered among Americans rather than using them as an opportunity to bash Bush.</span></p> <p><span>Calling Sept. 11 \u201cthe worst day we have ever seen,\u201d Kerry said that it had in fact \u201cbrought out the best in all of us.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI am proud that, after Sept. 11, all our people rallied to President Bush\u2019s call for unity to meet the danger,\u201d Kerry said. \u201cThere were no Democrats. There were no Republicans. There were only Americans. How we wish it had stayed that way.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps in anticipation of next month\u2019s Republican National Convention, which is scheduled to occur in Manhattan just before the third anniversary of the attacks, many of the DNC\u2019s key speakers made prominent references to Sept. 11, most falling in line with Kerry\u2019s non-confrontational message last night.</span></p> <p><span>Ending on perhaps the most uplifting note of an almost relentlessly upbeat convention week, Kerry portrayed himself as the candidate who would promote scientific and medical advances and lead America into a rosy future.</span></p> <p><span>Mentioning such past American innovations as the Wright Brothers\u2019 aeroplane prototypes, the moon-shot program of John F. Kennedy \u201940, also a former Crimson editor, and microchip technology, Kerry said he would lift current administrative restrictions on embryonic stem cell research\u2014and, in perhaps his deftest segue, tied this into the convention\u2019s theme of an optimistic party on the brink.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cNow it\u2019s our time to ask: What if?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Kerry said moments before the red, white and blue balloons fell on the convention floor. \u201cIt is time to reach for the next dream. It is time to look to the next horizon. For America, the hope is there. The sun is rising. Our best days are still to come.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Nicholas F.

{"title": "Roughing It (Sort Of) | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>SOMEWHERE IN AUSTRALIA\u2014I arrive at the Bald Rock Bush Retreat expecting to check the prices and move on, but after cresting a hill on a dirt road for which my rented Ford Focus is woefully unequipped, I am instantly captivated by the stunning Spanish-style hacienda. Gorgeous flowering vines climb in manicured patterns up broad stucco walls, and peering into windows I see clean, open rooms painted in bright oranges, greens, blues and reds. I\u2019m ahead of schedule so I opt to call it a day and settle into one of the dorm beds at the heart of the rugged, beautiful estate.</span></p> <p><span>But the dorm has been claimed by a group of eight local high schoolers, so I follow the Model T of the small man in the over-worn sweater and slight facial hair down to the only other thing he has available: \u201cthe hut.\u201d It has two lovely single beds, a gas stove, sink, fire place and stacks of wood. I run my hands over the walls to be sure the mischievous late afternoon sun hasn\u2019t camouflaged a light switch, but no luck. The cabin lies on a small man-made lake filled with fish bred by the owner, Booker, a German man who immigrated in the \u201960s and has held onto a heavy accent and a smoky cackle. (Do a lot of backpackers come through here? \u201cNo, mostly city couples foh dirty veekends. Heh heh heh heh!\u201d) He says the fish don\u2019t bite much in winter but I had come at the luckiest time, early evening, and informs me I\u2019m entitled to keep anything I catch. I ask if he\u2019s got an extra pole. \u201cYou ever done one of vese fings before?\u201d he says, handing it to me. \u201cFishing?\u201d I say, \u201cYeah, sure,\u201d only sort of lying.</span></p> <p><span>Booker (pronounced BOO-kehr, but still what a great name for a resort manager) points me to the compost heap, where there should be no shortage of \u201cverms.\u201d The sort of fishing I\u2019ve done has always been with lures or not-live bait. After shoveling through four feet of partially decomposed fruit, hay and cow shit I faintly glimpse ugly translucent wiggles\u2014not the cute pink type I used to step on in my driveway after a rain or the kind I opened up in freshman bio\u2014but worms who seem like they\u2019d be more comfortable eating my food from within my intestines than providing it for me at the end of a line. (In fairness I guess I\u2019d make the same choice.) They squirm away from the harsh light, diving back into the soil. I pick out a dozen and drop them into the bucket, wondering if they need water or soil or something but concluding they\u2019ll last the two-minute ride down to the lake.</span></p> <p><span>On my way back to the car a cattle dog straight from a bag of hearty pup chow approaches me with a ball in his mouth. \u201cThat\u2019s Rico!\u201d He growls if I try to take the ball and I struggle for a while to figure out what he wants, discovering finally that if I pick up a stick he immediately drops the ball and comes running for me, and vice versa. Silly Rico, always wants what he can\u2019t have. I know the feeling, buddy.</span></p> <p><span>My dog back home, a thoroughly spoiled English cocker spaniel, doesn\u2019t play fetch (I like to think it\u2019s because she\u2019s too smart, and not because I was too lazy to train her) so this keeps me fascinated for about 45 minutes, after which the dog collapses, panting and exhausted, on the grass. I imagine trying to tell Booker, already displeased with my ignorance of fishing, that I had killed his dog.</span></p> <p><span>Satisfied with the state of Rico\u2019s pulmonary health, I return to my bucket to find that more than half of the worms for which I had sifted through shit had, well, wormed their way out through cracks in the bottom of the bucket. Pleased that I would thus be forced to do less fishing, I take my remainders and head down to the water, where I proceed to sit, get cold and lose all my worms.</span></p> <p><span>I don\u2019t know how to clean and gut a fish anyway so it\u2019s just as well, I think, although I\u2019ve wasted the remaining light sticking rusty hooks through not-pinned-into-place worms and now face the prospect of starting a fire in the dark, unless I can get the kerosene lamp started. (Booker had given me a demonstration about how to use it. \u201cYou see? Vis and you pull vis and turn vis. Eezy. Got it?\u201d I didn\u2019t at all, but was too scared to ask questions, and at this point I hadn\u2019t even almost killed his dog yet.) After several futile attempts I finally remembered the candles and contented myself with those.</span></p> <p><span>The sun now fully set, I turn my attention to the fireplace. Fortunately it had only been two years since I last watched someone start a fire and only 11 since I had walked out mid-way through the intro meeting for the Cub Scouts and I remembered something about a pyramid. In just 45 minutes I build an impressive looking tower of sticks of varying sizes, filled on the inside with crumpled newspaper. It burns brilliantly\u2014just long enough for me to take a proud, paternal photograph\u2014before the paper burns away and the tower remains, singed but standing.</span></p> <p><span>Determined, I try again, getting it going for a good three hours while I cook, eat and clean after my dinner (plain pasta boiled with garlic and peanut butter spread over my four remaining meusli bars\u2014mmm!). I manage in the process to go through not only every log in the hut but every stick, twig or leaf in a 10-meter area outside.</span></p> <p><span>Finally content that I have wasted enough natural resources for a night, I abandon the fire and step into the frigid night, where the sky is as crowded as it is quiet. I look for the new constellations I have learned. I take in the extraordinary silence and solitude.</span></p> <p><span>Back inside I dump both blankets from each of the two beds on top of my hostel sheets, bring two candles next to the bed and read a chapter in <i>Kangaroo</i>, D.H. Lawrence\u2019s Australian novel\u2014my half-assed attempt at cultural immersion. Thankfully, a three-hour fire does heat up a small room quite a bit, so my sleep is just shy of miserable for the first half hour.</span></p> <p><span>I wake unable to feel my feet.</span></p> <p><span>In the morning Booker, far more cordial when he is not expecting eight teenagers about to destroy his newly-renovated dorm, offers me a cup of coffee and asks to see the write-up in <i>Let\u2019s Go</i>. He is immensely pleased that the book mentions the Exodus festival, which occurs, it seems, whenever he feels like losing money on it. (\u201cNot Woodstock,\u201d he says, \u201cGoodstock. Heh heh heh heh.\u201d) Each January for the past few years, 5,000 people have descended on the tiny lake where I not-fished, filling in a 2-kilometer square area with tents, camper vans and drugs the government doesn\u2019t even know exist. Booker\u2019s just the host, not the booker (most people never get to see a pun that good in the wild, and the habitat is fading fast); a production company called Happy People Productions take care of all publicity, booking DJs and bands, equipment, as well as putting together a promotional video, which I have the privilege of viewing.</span></p> <p><span>The main DJ stand last year was behind a Model T constructed entirely of CDs. Boats shaped like dragons, with snouts that spout fire, float across the lake. Fire twirlers on stilts meander around with no evident purpose.</span></p> <p><span>Maybe they\u2019re looking for the kerosene.</span></p> <p><span>Hey, it\u2019s over here! I\u2019m not using any. Really, go ahead, it\u2019s all yours.</span></p> <p><span><i>David B.

{"title": "Puns, Politics and Lots of Flying Balls | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Last week, as the Democratic National Convention filled Boston\u2019s FleetCenter with four straight days of platform-pounding and strategic maneuvers, a political juggling act of a different sort was getting underway at Cambridge\u2019s very own American Repertory Theatre (ART): the latest effort of the Flying Karamazov Brothers.</span></p> <p><span>While Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., was hailed as a war hero turned peacemaker by speaker after speaker, the Brothers preferred to dub themselves the \u201cmen of the epididymis.\u201d To live up to the title, three of the four avant-garde jugglers donned spermatozoan headgear and sang of the miracles of conception while the last ersatz sibling lolled about the stage in the filmy garb of a gigantic ovum.</span></p> <p><span>But this was only one of the many interludes making up \u201cLife: A Guide for the (Politically) Perplexed (Convention Edition),\u201d a meta-vaudeville-cum-<i>commedia-dell\u2019arte</i> revue now completing the last of two weeks at the ART.</span></p> <p><span>Those arriving at the Brattle Street theater expecting a spot of Dostoevskian drama will be disappointed to learn that the performers\u2019 formidable moustaches are practically the only things linking the men on stage to their Russian namesakes Dmitri, Alexei, Ivan and Pavel. And only three of the entertainers have facial hair.</span></p> <p><span>But all four are as deft with political satire, wordplay and cultural allusion as they are with the balls they send flying through the air.</span></p> <p><span>Lead \u201cbrother\u201d Paul \u201cDmitri\u201d Magid, who wrote the madcap script, explains that such a heady mixture was once <i>de rigeur</i> in the California street-theater scene where he and co-founder Howard Jay \u201cIvan\u201d Patterson hit upon the idea that would make them stars.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cOnly these days,\u201d Magid tells The Crimson after last Saturday\u2019s performance, when asked if he thinks his brand of social commentary and sleight-of-hand is unique. \u201cThere\u2019s not enough political juggling.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>For a moment, he looks downcast. But with the help of Patterson, Mark \u201cAlexei\u201d Ettinger or Roderick \u201cPavel\u201d Kimball, Magid\u2019s spirits are high as he tosses anything that will fly.</span></p> <p><span>And it is anything. The artistes are most at home with a juggling pin\u2014or five\u2014in the air above them, but a dead squid, items of clothing, mangled Slinkies and olive-oil-doused kelp have been some of the odder items volunteered for an audience-participation gambit that has become one of the troupe\u2019s trademark routines.</span></p> <p><span>Entitled \u201cThe Gamble,\u201d the nail-biting ritual ends with either a standing ovation or a pie to one of the Brothers\u2019 faces, depending on how adeptly they can adopt the surprise items into their juggling act.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cLongtime fans kinda know to bring stuff,\u201d says Anbodha, a one-name sound technician for the band of brothers, with a mischievous grin.</span></p> <p><span><b>THE SOUND OF ONE BALL FALLING</b></span></p> <p><span>The show\u2019s plot, if it can be called such, can be summarized as follows: A mystical book, patterned loosely after Maimonides\u2019 Medieval Jewish <i>Guide to the Perplexed</i>, offers cryptic solace to a man engulfed in a midlife crisis. In the course of reading the magical book\u2019s rules, the man revisits the many stages of his life via rock opera, Bollywood lip-synching\u2014and, of course, a healthy dose of meticulously choreographed team juggling.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cLife\u201d has been performed at only two venues before coming to Cambridge\u2014Magid says it\u2019s just now been perfected\u2014and was a year in the making.</span></p> <p><span>Magid says he drew inspiration from the fertile plains of the Italian countryside, where he read the works of Dante and Maimonides, the latter in translation.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI don\u2019t read Arabic,\u201d he explains with a tug at his ample moustache when asked if he\u2019s seen the original text of the abstruse volume. \u201cI want to some day.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The current version of the play, meanwhile, is itself a kind of translation: Magid says \u201cLife\u201d was first written in the tongue of Michelangelo and the Medicis.</span></p> <p><span>Today, though, it\u2019s pure American comic existentialism, stealing a glance away from its navel to plunder decades of pop culture. References to weapons of mass destruction, The Matrix and Popeye abound among more serious moments of reflection.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI\u2019ve reached a certain age,\u201d Magid says as he pulls at his lustrous handlebar, stretching the last two words with a voluptuously Gallic inflection.</span></p> <p><span>Thus the play casts a cocked eye\u2014and the occasional errant juggling ball\u2014at the many stages of life that follow the epididymis men\u2019s procreative dance. In one particularly revealing number, As You Like It\u2019s \u201cseven ages of man\u201d speech is set to Queenly guitars as the four men take places behind rock instruments.</span></p> <p><span>Though their detailed choreography seems largely second-nature, even the masterful Karamazovs drop the ball from time to time. For those in the audience, this can prove disconcerting.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI felt stressed out,\u201d says show-goer Chris Denune after Saturday\u2019s performance.</span></p> <p><span>Denune explains that he watched the most complex juggling sequences with a mixture of rapt attention and fear that at any moment, a ball could fall from orbit.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s that age-old thing about juggling,\u201d Denune says.</span></p> <p><span>Still, anyone can see that it takes profound discipline to make as few mistakes as the Brothers do in presenting such an elaborate spectacle.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI would like to know more about them and their whole philosophies,\u201d says audience member Joan Mullen as she reenters the theater lobby.</span></p> <p><span>But where some wonder, The Crimson found out.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe feel that juggling is dropping,\u201d Magid says, looking very much like a Zen monk as he smooths his whiskers. \u201cIt\u2019s the failure that is important.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe thing about juggling is that if you blow it everybody sees it,\u201d he explains further. \u201cIt\u2019s a very honest art that way.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Magid also makes time for an art that\u2019s considerably less honest, though just as much in the public eye\u2014politics. Jokes about stolen elections and trumped-up wars make it easy to discern which way the Brothers will be voting come November. These balls are firmly in left field. But just to make sure, The Crimson inquired as to that most critical qualification for holding high office: Which presidential candidate does Magid think would juggle best?</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think John Kerry would be better,\u201d he replies with little hesitation and a quick twirl of the \u2019stache. \u201cGeorge Bush would be too arrogant...[he] wouldn\u2019t have the patience with how much failure it takes to juggle.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff writer Amelia E.

{"title": "Harvard's Convention | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>BOSTON\u2014Are we sure the FleetCenter isn\u2019t in Harvard Square?</span></p> <p><span>Headstrong about avoiding the I-banker/consultant pack and charting a more solitary course, I imagined my job\u2014researcher/writer/latte-boy at NBC News\u2014would mean new people and far-flung places.</span></p> <p><span>Even at the Democratic convention, I thought: hours milling about the floor, tripping over balloons, beer with the delegate from Kansas who would tell me what the Bush administration\u2019s done to hurt the wheat farmers. Without leaving the hall, I would have gone to Louisiana, Oklahoma, Oregon, Maine, everywhere I haven\u2019t been. And I would have heard a different side of the story of America.</span></p> <p><span>But on the way to the floor, there was the rising sophomore whose name I can\u2019t remember, there was the guy I was in section with two years ago who wants to gossip about his ex-girlfriend (also working here), there was the former jogging buddy who needed to know: Were my credentials better than his?</span></p> <p><span>I bumped into a friend obsessed with a party he couldn\u2019t get into and wondering whether I had some connection. My dinner break was dominated by the news that an undergrad talked a movie star into bed hours after they met at a Creative Coalition fundraiser. The exit was clogged by people I knew without a press pass and trying to persuade the guard to let them in.</span></p> <p><span>And right then, literally pushed out by a young volunteer, that delegate from Kansas came through, punished for drinking the beer I imagined the two of us would share.</span></p> <p><span>The convention felt like Harvard, Harvard, everywhere, and nothing alcoholic to drink.</span></p> <p><span>Many of my native species (<i>Cantabridgius ante-professionalius ambitious</i>) had fled our summer habitats in Washington and on Wall Street for cooler temperatures, and hotter klieg lights, closer to home. According to a spokesperson for Boston 2004, the city\u2019s convention host committee, more than 400 Harvard students volunteered (I\u2019m sure the Republicans will have a precise number for their convention). An Office of Career Services official, who\u2014oddly\u2014did not want to be named, said it was the first time in his memory that anything had rivaled financial services companies and Congressional offices for such a \u201clarge and concentrated group of undergraduates.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>We came, ostensibly, to serve, to cover, to protest the convention that would define one of the two men who will lead America in a perilous time. The issues the candidates are debating\u2014budget deficits, health care costs and, most of all, the terrorist threat\u2014will set the agenda not just for this election, but for years to come. And yet again, Harvard\u2014despite our myriad political passions\u2014seemed reluctant to look beyond itself.</span></p> <p><span>President Clinton\u2019s speech provoked a momentary stir\u2014more a comparison of his style and that of Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., though, than a serious discussion of the issues he raised. Teresa Heinz Kerry changed our focus, but I won\u2019t pretend that her money, her Botox, and her almost laughably self-serious mien drew less attention than the substance, as such, of her Evita-like oration. John Kerry, with a salute and tough declarative prose, crossed the commander-in-chief threshold Thursday night and dominated the conversation for about the 30 minutes it took to leave the hall and try to sneak into a party down the street.</span></p> <p><span>The game-changer came as a complete surprise\u2014on \u201cBlack Tuesday,\u201d so called because the networks decided there was nothing worth covering, not even for an hour, on the convention\u2019s second night.</span></p> <p><span>A little-known, but now very famous, state senator named Barack Obama electrified the crowd. Half black Nigerian, half white Kansan, from Chicago by way of New York and Hawaii, Obama was the convention\u2019s keynote speaker\u2014a distinction that meant middling reviews and continued obscurity for most of the politicians given the job. But with breathtaking confidence, breezy style and an earnest, resonant voice, the next U.S. senator from Illinois delivered the most powerful tribute to a political campaign in 20 years. Despite years battling the longest odds to make progress for inner city kids and struggling South Side neighborhoods, Obama explicitly rejected cynicism and embraced \u201cthe politics of hope.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>He managed to capture, in a brief speech, the promise of progressive politics and the magic of America. The man is impossible to caricature: he speaks just as strongly about God\u2019s gifts and the limits of government as he does about America\u2019s responsibility to lift workers out of poverty. Obama is an optimist despite setbacks, an intellectual with a common touch and a professional politician who can truly inspire.</span></p> <p><span>At the end of his speech\u2014\u201cThis country is...the hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America has a place for him, too\u201d\u2014my phone didn\u2019t stop ringing.

{"title": "Conventions Still Matter, Poll Finds | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Most Americans think political conventions play a vital role in presidential campaigns, according to a poll released last week by the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy at the Kennedy School of Government (KSG).</span></p> <p><span>The poll, conducted last month during the week of the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Boston, found that 63 percent of respondents saw party conventions as \u201cstill important because they give Americans an in-depth opportunity to know the candidates better.\u201d Thirty-seven percent thought otherwise, believing that primary elections already determined presidential nominees \u201cmonths in advance.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The poll surveyed about 1,300 adults and had a sampling error of plus or minus 4 percent.</span></p> <p><span>Bradlee Professor of Government and the Press Thomas E. Patterson said the results could be attributed to the concentrated coverage that the convention provides in a short period of time.</span></p> <p><span>\u201c[Americans] live in a campaign that is 18 months long, and no sane person would pay close attention to the campaign for a year and a half,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cThat may make sense for pundits and for people like me. There\u2019s always those campaign junkies out there\u2014they\u2019re like Red Sox fans. For most citizens, we overtax them. Our campaigns just last too long.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Instead, key moments in the campaign tend to attract the general public\u2019s interest, Patterson said, listing January\u2019s Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primaries\u2014and the summer conventions.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think Americans understand it\u2019s a different look at the candidates, it\u2019s a deeper look at the candidates and in that sense, it\u2019s a special opportunity,\u201d he said of conventions.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard College Democrats President Andrew J. Frank \u201905 singled out other reasons for the poll results, pointing to the convention as an opportunity for a \u201cpositive portrayal of politics.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think it\u2019s the only time during a campaign where each side is able to frame themselves in their own way without being compared or attacked,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a time for the country to get to really know the presidential nominee and to get to know the party on its own terms.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But Jonathan S. Chavez \u201905, chair of the Institute of Politics (IOP) student survey committee, also pointed to expectations as a factor that could have played into the poll results.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cPart of this response could be the fact that it is the response people feel they are supposed to give,\u201d he wrote in an e-mail. \u201cPeople don\u2019t like admitting they don\u2019t care about politics. There is a stigma attached to being apathetic.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The survey also indicated that party conventions contributed to election interest. Forty-six percent of those polled said that they had discussed the campaign in the past 24 hours, a figure that had risen substantially from the 28 percent of respondents in the mid-July poll.</span></p> <p><span>These results, Patterson said, were not surprising, considering that the poll took place at the time of convention.</span></p> <p><span>Of those who caught a televised segment of the DNC, 23 percent claimed to have not learned \u201cnot much at all\u201d about nominee Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., compared to 40 percent who said that they had learned a \u201cgreat deal\u201d or \u201cquite a bit\u201d about him.</span></p> <p><span>Regardless, Kerry did not experience a significant increase in poll standings following the convention. According to a post-convention CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll conducted between July 30 and August 1, 57 percent of Americans had a favorable view of the Massachusetts senator, a 2 percent spike from his standings prior to the convention.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cKerry\u2019s post convention polling numbers are a bit of an anomaly. Usually a candidate sees a huge bounce following a national convention,\u201d Chavez said. \u201cThat didn\u2019t happen this time. A large part of that is due to the fact that the country is already so divided: only somewhere around 7 [percent] of people are still unsure of who they will vote for [according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll].\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But Patterson credited the small bounce not only to the smaller number of undecided voters this year, but also to the cutback in convention coverage on broadcast networks.</span></p> <p><span>According to the Shorenstein poll, the viewing audience this year would have surpassed that of the 2000 election if ABC, CBS and NBC had not reduced coverage from five hours in 2000 to three hours this year.</span></p> <p><span>Still, in spite of the small bounce in the polls, Kerry managed to generate a positive impression, with seven times as many respondents indicating that they thought \u201cbetter\u201d of him than they thought \u201cworse\u201d of him.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening now is what needed to happen, where people are now voting for John Kerry and not voting against George W. Bush,\u201d Frank said.</span></p> <p><span>The poll also found that around half of the convention audience consisted of viewers who stumbled upon the convention while watching television. Identifying the broadcast networks as essential to attracting a convention\u2019s \u201cinadvertent viewers,\u201d the poll found that viewers are more likely to come across convention coverage and watch it if televised on broadcast networks.</span></p> <p><span>More than 60 percent of DNC viewers on broadcast networks stumbled upon the coverage inadvertently, whereas less than 40 percent of such viewers tuned into the convention via a cable network in spite of its more extensive coverage.</span></p> <p><span>Younger adults, in particular, were affected by the reduced broadcast coverage. Sixty-three percent of adults 30 years of age or younger identified themselves as inadvertent convention viewers, compared to 47 percent of older adults.</span></p> <p><span>Older adults, Patterson said, are \u201cmore plugged in to the daily news or have a history with the convention\u201d and were thus more likely to turn on the convention to watch it.</span></p> <p><span>As younger adults were more likely to come across the convention by accident, the reduced coverage on the broadcast networks \u201cimplicitly roadblocks\u201d their access, Patterson said.</span></p> <p><span>But some pointed out that convention coverage was still effective.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI thought it was interesting that such a high percentage of the respondents though that the convention gave them an opportunity to know the candidates better,\u201d said Harvard Republican Club Secretary Lauren K. Truesdell \u201905. \u201cI guess it shows that this sort of four-day-long commercial really is working. Despite this reduced news coverage, their message still comes across.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Still, IOP Student Advisory Committee President Ilan T. Graff \u201905 said the reduced coverage had its setbacks.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe fact that younger and older Americans don\u2019t have access to both party conventions to the degree they have in the past makes it likely that when people do cast their vote, they will do so with less information at their disposal than when they might otherwise have had,\u201d Graff said.</span></p> <p><span>Given the higher level of public interest in this year\u2019s campaign, Patterson said that broadcast networks need to expand their coverage.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis election process provides an opportunity to bring young people back into the process,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cIt ought to be seen that way. Players like the broadcast network need to do their part. They\u2019re not meeting their public service responsibility.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff writer Margaret W.

{"title": "The Ugly Sunset of the Weapons Ban | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>WASHINGTON, D.C.\u2014Pointing to my bulging biceps, I jawed on the sidelines Wednesday about how the Assault Weapons Ban was keeping \u201cthese guns\u201d off the field of the Feinstein vs. Schumer Senate staff softball game. But come September 13, not even the overstocked lineup of the \u201cNever Say Di\u201d squad will be able to bar these manly-man arms from the diamond. On that day, my biceps, and less lethal assault weapons like the AK-47 and TEC-DC9 are set to be legally manufactured and sold for the first time in ten years.</span></p> <p><span>If Washington, D.C. has a good, a bad and an ugly, the unfolding political drama of the Assault Weapons Ban steals the show for ugly.</span></p> <p><span>Originally enacted in 1994 for a period of 10 years, the ban prohibits the manufacture or import of military-style semi-automatic assault weapons. Between 1988 and 1991, when these guns were legal, assault weapons were eight times more likely to be used in crimes than other types of guns. By 2002, crimes attributed to assault weapons declined 66 percent since the ban\u2019s inception. The legislation has been a success. Should the sun set on the ban on Sept. 13, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Tom Ridge \u201967 may have to pull out another orange M&amp;M to ensure our population\u2019s vigilance against terrorists, now armed with Uzis\u2014purchased in the United States.</span></p> <p><span>Why, despite its effectiveness, is it looking increasingly unlikely that the ban will be renewed? Certainly not for lack of public support. The University of Pennsylvania\u2019s National Annenberg Election Survey, interviewing nearly 30,000 people, found that 71 percent of households without guns support extending the ban, as do 64 percent of households with guns.</span></p> <p><span>The legislation also has presidential support. Lots of it. The late President Ronald Reagan, honored in 1983 as a Life Member of the National Rifle Association (NRA)\u2014one of only 19 individuals to earn that honor in the NRA\u2019s 133-year history\u2014was instrumental in lobbying members of congress to pass the original ban in 1994. On June 14, 2004, Presidents Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, and Bill Clinton sent a letter to George W. Bush urging him to renew the ban. Add in the tacit support of President George H.W. Bush who took the initial steps in protecting Americans from these weapons by banning the importation of certain assault rifles in 1989, and we have every U.S. president of the last three decades casting their vote in favor extending this ban.</span></p> <p><span>And the kicker? So would the current president, ostensibly.</span></p> <p><span>Five years ago yesterday, then-Texas Governor George W. Bush said, \u201cIt makes no sense for assault weapons to be around our society,\u201d but despite that and more recent comments indicating his support for the ban, it\u2019s becoming increasingly apparent that President Bush will let the ban on those very weapons expire one month from today. Because, though this president has said that he would sign a renewal should the bill reach his desk, he has enlisted his congressional posse\u2014House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, R-Texas and Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn.\u2014to make sure the bill never does. In turn, these men, responsible for bringing the bill to a vote, say they will do so only if the President asks them to. And with the NRA\u2019s gun to his head, he will not be asking anytime soon.</span></p> <p><span>In the last six elections, the Republican candidate has only attained victory on the wings of an NRA endorsement. When the NRA stood silent in 1992 and 1996, the Democrats won handily. The man who won those elections, Bill Clinton, maintains that on the pecking order of determining factors in the 2000 Bush victory, the NRA stands next to Ralph Nader, behind only the Supreme Court, potentially costing Gore critical states such as Arkansas, West Virginia, Tennessee, Florida and New Hampshire.</span></p> <p><span>So far that essential NRA endorsement is on hold for our incumbent. When might it come around? \u201cI think Sept. 14 would make a good date,\u201d says Larry Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of America.</span></p> <p><span>So in the midst of a War on Terror and escalating threat levels, and despite proven effectiveness and widespread support, the assault weapons is going to need the work of many bulging biceps to find new life and breakthrough the ugly side of Washington.</span></p> <p><span><i>Michael B.

{"title": "Bling Bling and the Ballot Box | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>NEW YORK\u2014As I watched P. Diddy strut on stage, Rage Against the Machine blaring in the background, I couldn\u2019t get past a cynical dose of skepticism. In a heavily air-conditioned auditorium at New York University, the rapper-turned-record-producer-turned-social-activist pontificated behind a podium on his latest public relations offensive, \u201cCitizen Change.\u201d Think MTV\u2019s Rock the Vote, but more bling-bling. Instead of selling albums, the inventor of the remix was now pitching his program to sell voting to our notoriously apathetic generation\u2014with flashy logos, celebrity jet tours and, of course, a lot of merchandise for sale. He even hired professional models to come on stage sporting the latest t-shirts in his Sean John clothing line, which advertise Citizen Change\u2019s slogan, \u201cVote or Die,\u201d in large block letters.</span></p> <p><span>Will catering to the materialism of 18- to 24-year-olds work where Rocking the Vote only sort of made teens who were already thinking about voting anyway kind of want to cast a ballot a little more? I certainly wasn\u2019t convinced. American adults have a hard enough time getting themselves to the polls on election day\u2014not to mention their kids. The significance of the youth vote has only waned for as long as I have been politically conscious (that would be since around 1992, when I conducted my own exit poll at my elementary school and tried to get on L.A. talk radio with my results). I don\u2019t see that trend reversing simply because another recording artist wanted to make politics cool.</span></p> <p><span>But after some consideration, I\u2019m becoming more optimistic about young voter turnout this election cycle. On top of the non-partisan get-out-the-vote drives aimed at youth, there are forces marshaling against President Bush that are influential with Generation Y, and it looks like young Americans\u2014generally more liberal than the population at large, and therefore more likely to hop on the anti-Bush bandwagon\u2014are responding.</span></p> <p><span>My first hint the 2004 might be different came at a Beastie Boys concert in the Jones Beach Amphitheater. All Mike D had to do is say the words \u201cPresident Bush\u201d to elicit a chorus of boos from the audience. Then I started to see \u201cVote or Die\u201d signs in storefronts. I am covering the 2004 campaign for Salon.com\u2014my ticket into the P. Diddy press conference\u2014so I did some digging.</span></p> <p><span>It turns out that young Americans look more politically motivated than they have been in more than a decade\u2014since Bill Clinton\u2019s first presidential election in 1992, when a generation of grunge-rock inspired activists answered Nirvana\u2019s call to kick George Bush Sr. out of the Oval Office.</span></p> <p><span>The most obvious cause for optimism this election cycle comes from the entertainment industry. Like in 1992, musicians are unusually active in the effort to oust the president. It\u2019s not just Bruce Springsteen, a classic in his own right going on tour to raise money for the anti-Bush 527 group America Coming Together. It\u2019s Green Day and the Beastie Boys, both out with new albums laden with anti-Bush lyrics. It\u2019s Mary J. Blige, Missy Eliot and Eve collaborating on a cover of \u201cWake Up Everybody,\u201d an old R&amp;B hit Jimmy Carter used in his 1976 presidential campaign. It\u2019s Pearl Jam and the Dixie Chicks cutting an album with Springsteen and joining his 28-city tour.</span></p> <p><span>And there are signs of serious movement in the political preferences of the 18- to 24-year-old demographic. The Washington Post released a poll yesterday that showed John Kerry with a two-to-one lead over President Bush among younger voters. Some of Kerry\u2019s large lead, verified by other recent polls, came from young, disenchanted Bush supporters switching sides. But the poll also found that teens and twenty-somethings who did not vote in 2000\u2014but will in 2004\u2014are also pushing Kerry\u2019s numbers up.</span></p> <p><span>Add to this mountains of polling data and anecdotal evidence suggesting that the war in Iraq has become seriously unpopular with American youth, and a strong young voter turnout in November looks even more likely.</span></p> <p><span>This leads to the inevitable question: Why now? There are the obvious reasons. Young Americans continue to die in an increasingly unpopular war\u2014Generation Y is getting to know what it feels like to lose a brother, friend or father in the service. Talk (however unlikely) of reinstituting the draft has been afoot for months. And the weak economy is often toughest on those just starting their careers.</span></p> <p><span>But I think there is also a broader, generational effect at work here. The values of the first generation to grow up in the post-Cold War world are decidedly more liberal than those of their predecessors. Generation Y is pro-gay-rights, overwhelmingly pro-choice and anti-war. We are often materialistic, as P. Diddy\u2019s campaign suggests, but we don\u2019t believe greed is always good. President Bush has attacked every one of these values in his first term; he is out-of-step with the future.</span></p> <p><span>The skeptic in me still thinks that youth turnout won\u2019t be spectacular in November, despite P. Diddy\u2019s celebrity-studded jet tour. But it will be better than before. And all it took was four years of a radical right-winger in the White House.</span></p> <p><span><i>Stephen W.

{"title": "Kerry's Smart Choice for VP | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>If the rule for picking a vice-presidential running mate\u2014like the rule for modern medicine\u2014is first, do no harm, I\u2019ve got the perfect choice for Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass.: Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.</span></p> <p><span>Of course, we all know that\u2014for doctors and politicians alike\u2014things are a lot more complicated than the Hippocratic Oath. A vast constellation of criteria looms before Kerry. He could pick The Hot Choice\u2014the man or woman who would guarantee media acclaim; The Political Choice\u2014the person who would achieve a balanced, multi-ethnic, multi-ideological and multi-gendered ticket; or even the The Pander-bear Choice\u2014exciting his party base by throwing them a politician they love.</span></p> <p><span>But, to me, The Smart Choice means focusing on the factors that really matter\u2014having the courage to sacrifice a little July pizzazz in exchange for November results.</span></p> <p><span>The Smart Choice could do the following things, in ascending order. He or she could carry a state: IBM Professor of Business and Government Roger B. Porter, who teaches Government 1540, \u201cThe American Presidency,\u201d says modern vice-presidential candidates typically add about three percent to the ticket\u2019s vote in their home state. Kerry\u2019s ideal candidate, then, should come from a state that will swing on a few percentage points.</span></p> <p><span>The Smart Choice could also be president. One way or another, about one in five vice presidents have become commander-in-chief. And, since Walter Mondale, all vice presidents have played a significant role in the political scene after their terms ended. In wartime, voters will only replace the incumbent if the alternative is ready to lead. A steady, experienced running mate could make change feel a bit less risky.</span></p> <p><span>He or she could also reflect good qualities. Kerry\u2019s choice\u2014timed before the conventions and the debates\u2014will be a sledgehammer to the wall separating Kerry and the voters. It will be the first major stage of the Democratic effort to define who this man is. Kerry\u2019s pick will communicate the qualities and values that Kerry believes are most important\u2014and that would ultimately define a Kerry presidency.</span></p> <p><span>Finally, The Smart Choice should do no harm. Yes\u2014despite everything else\u2014this is still most important aspect of all. If a running mate has some dark secret in his past\u2014a mistress, a felony, rehab\u2014he will be a liability. Unless the choice is almost inhumanly scandal-free, nothing else matters. Senator Kerry, you could object to this rule, you could (rightly) argue that it drives many qualified, capable people out of public life. But ignore it at your peril.</span></p> <p><span>Gephardt passes all these tests. President Bush carried Missouri in 2000\u2014but by less than three percent. No one could seriously question Gephardt\u2019s experience, competence or character\u2014the former House Democratic leader could walk in the Oval Office and be president tomorrow. And the still-boyish 62-year-old carries all the controversy of a Hallmark card\u2014not a smidgen of scandal in 30 years of public life. He is still one of the best-liked, most widely respected leaders of either party. Gephardt could match Vice President Cheney\u2019s stature in a debate, and then beat him with an economic appeal to his fellow middle-class Midwesterners. More than that, Gephardt would make a superb vice president: a bridge to Congress, a leader on national security, a sounding board on the concerns of working Americans.</span></p> <p><span>In the end, the old saying, \u201cnobody votes for vice president,\u201d will still hold true: This is the presidential candidates\u2019 race to win or lose. But, then again, nothing is more presidential than recruiting a deputy who could be president too.</span></p> <p><span><i>Brian M.

Stem cells drawn from human embryos, the most controversial and most promising variety, can develop into any human cell.</span></p> <p><span>Cabot Professor of the Natural Sciences Douglas A. Melton, co-director with Scadden, said the institute would examine the ethical issues surrounding stem cell research.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis work is controversial, and we don\u2019t plan to sidestep that controversy,\u201d Melton said.</span></p> <p><span>The symposium on Friday morning featured remarks from Bass Professor of Government Michael J. Sandel\u2014teacher of the popular course, Moral Reasoning 22, \u201cJustice\u201d\u2014who defended human embryonic stem cell research on moral grounds but warned of its close relationship to human cloning. Sandel, a member of President Bush\u2019s Council on Bioethics, has opposed human cloning.</span></p> <p><span>The financial ambiguity in the launch of the Stem Cell Institute stood in contrast to Harvard\u2019s announcement last June of the Broad Institute, which administrators quickly publicized as a $200-million joint venture with MIT to study the human genome.

Time after time, championship dreams have come down to Harvard versus Yale, Crimson and Bulldogs, mano a mano.

{"title": "Making it Worse | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>One of the classic devices in situation comedy\u2014and some tragedy\u2014is for a character\u2019s solution to a simple problem to prove worse than the problem itself. Rather than accept the consequences of a mistake, the hero comes up with a solution that makes things worse, until things escalate into a climax either with hilarious consequences, or catastrophe, depending on the genre. Either way, it\u2019s becoming a familiar script for this White House, which now routinely embarrasses itself not just by making the wrong choices, but by refusing to face them later on. Some poor decision-making in the White House makes the administration wrong, but it\u2019s the effort to defend those poor decisions that makes them ridiculous.</span></p> <p><span>The 9/11 hearings are a classic example. If liberals are honest with themselves, they will admit that they, too, could not have seen the attacks coming. Had Bush attacked Afghanistan in early 2001, as some say he should have, people like me would have protested furiously (I know I did when Clinton tried to). Obviously, it\u2019s bad that Bush took a long vacation after reading a memo entitled \u201cBin Laden Determined to Attack Inside U.S.\u201d and that Attorney General Ashcroft proposed cuts in counterterrorism funding on 9/10. But it wouldn\u2019t have been so bad if the White House had cooperated fully with the Commission and come out publicly with an honest message\u2014something like \u201cOur government failed to anticipate and to prevent 9/11 because no one could have guessed it was coming. We will do better next time.\u201d People like me would have had nothing to say against them. But, as often happens, the cover-up was worse than that which was covered up.</span></p> <p><span>The security memo\u2014embarrassing but not devastating\u2014became an issue because the White House made a ridiculous combination of assertions, first that the document was too \u201chistorical\u201d to have acted on, then that it was too current to declassify. The administration\u2019s whole history with the Commission, from opposing its creation to refusing to share documents and testify before it, has conveyed the impression that the White House has something to hide\u2014an impression far more damaging than the fact that the administration made a number of predictable human errors and oversights before the attacks.</span></p> <p><span>The unfortunate matter of the flag-draped coffins is playing out the same way. The Pentagon\u2019s policy on not allowing images of coffins returning from war is understandable, if inexcusable. The policy could have been defended on grounds of morale or taste, for example. But when a number of tasteful, moving images of caskets returning from Iraq were released from the press, the White House decided to defend an ill-conceived policy rather than let it pass, and once again crossed the line from the mistaken to the absurd. A spokesperson for our president condemned the release of the photographs, with the bizarre comment \u201cWe must pay attention to the privacy and to the sensitivity of the families of the fallen.\u201d Of course we must, but what could privacy possibly have to do with undated images of anonymous flag-draped coffins? The position will become more ridiculous when some reporter writes up Bush\u2019s silence a few weeks ago when American television networks decided to broadcast images of the mutilated bodies of four identified American civilians killed in Fallujah\u2014images which, of course, revealed the barbarity of the resistance.</span></p> <p><span>The freshest instance of this cover-up phenomenon has not yet become a scandal, but it should. One of the revelations in Bob Woodward\u2019s insider account of the White House at war with Iraq was that, contrary to what Bush now says, the decision to go to war was made well in advance. We know this because, in an interview, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld recalled telling a foreign official (almost certainly Saudi Prince Bandar) about the plans in January. (It now appears that Bandar knew of the decision before Colin Powell.) But the quote from Rumsfeld\u2019s taped, transcribed interview with Woodward, in which he described telling Bandar that he could \u201ctake that to the bank this is going to happen,\u201d has mysteriously been deleted from the Pentagon\u2019s version of the transcript. Also deleted by the Pentagon (but, luckily, preserved in Woodward\u2019s transcript, according to the Washington Post) is the following incredible statement from Rumsfeld: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to clean some of this up in the transcript. We\u2019ll give you a\u2014I mean you just said Bandar and I didn\u2019t agree with that so we\u2019re going to have to\u2014I don\u2019t want to say who it is but you are going to have to go through that and find a way to clean up my language too.\u201d When questioned about the deleted passages, Rumsfeld got meta-ridiculous, trying to cover up the cover-up by dismissing the deleted passages as \u201csome banter.\u201d Apparently, when you\u2019re the defense secretary, your conversations are so important that admitting that you shared secret war plans that you claim never to have finalized with a Saudi Prince before you told your own Secretary of State constitutes \u201cbanter.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Why does the White House make these self-destructive defensive maneuvers? The answer may lie in an unlikely comparison. When, at his last press conference, President Bush refused to accept any responsibility for the failures that led to 9/11, and could not, when asked, furnish an example of any mistakes he had made and learned from since then, he reminded me of\u2014of all people\u2014Bill Clinton. You may remember that, as the Monica Lewinsky crisis escalated towards impeachment, many observers remarked that it was not the affair but the lie to the nation (\u201cI did not have sexual relations\u2026\u201d) that made impeachment politically possible. Had the President set aside his pride and more swiftly apologized, many think, the impeachment balloon might have been deflated. Likewise, if Bush stood up like Richard Clarke and took responsibility, it would be much harder to criticize his attitude on the 9/11 attacks. If his officials would straightforwardly defend their actions\u2014explain why the caskets are worth it, for example, rather than hide them\u2014then the election would be about honest disagreements, rather than deceptive practices. But this White House, for all its imperfections, is proving to be a perfectionist\u2014unable to acknowledge errors, even when they might be defensible. How supremely ironic that, as John Kerry\u2019s campaign struggles to make him look more \u201chuman,\u201d President Bush seems unable to acknowledge that he and his advisors are just that.</span></p> <p><span><i>Peter P.M.

Neither, it seems, does the Bush Administration\u2019s conception of executive power.</span></p> <p><span>Yesterday, Supreme Court justices heard arguments in the cases of Jose Padilla and Yaser Hamdi, U.S. citizens who have been detained in a South Carolina prison without counsel or formal criminal charges for two years. While Hamdi was captured by the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan, Padilla was arrested on American soil.

But Jenny Martinez, Padilla\u2019s lawyer, rightly challenges the basic assumptions the government made when her client was detained. The most important issue is whether Padilla, arrested on American soil, should be declared an enemy combatant in the first place. The government\u2019s lawyer, Deputy Solicitor General Paul D. Clement, claims that because the war on terror is global the whole of the United States is a battleground as well. But if the Supreme Court accepts this justification, it will open the way for the Executive Branch to wield the same kinds of \u201cemergency powers\u201d so often misused in Third World dictatorships. Because the war on terror has no borders and no way of being declared \u201cover,\u201d the Bush Administration can effectively continue to detain Padilla and anyone else it pleases indefinitely.</span></p> <p><span>History is littered with examples of misuse of executive power during wartime.

{"title": "No Conspiracy Here | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>\u201cYou can\u2019t be a conservative Republican; you\u2019re not heartless!\u201d a friend recently said to me. This off-handed and not entirely serious comment highlighted a very real cultural phenomenon at Harvard: the monolithic way in which students in the liberal tree house often view conservatives. That is, all too frequently Harvard students forget that conservatives are actually people, not faceless supporters of the \u201cvast right wing conspiracy,\u201d nefarious Fox News contributors or simply bigots.</span></p> <p><span>Most frustratingly, being a conservative at Harvard almost inevitably means being ideologically lumped together with other conservatives on and off campus. This is a common liberal rejoinder: \u201cWell, what do you think of Ann Coulter? She\u2019s crazy!\u201d You see, Harvard conservatives don\u2019t just need to defend their personal politics; they must also answer for the perceived crimes of Ann Coulter, Bill O\u2019Reilly and Rush Limbaugh. However, because of Harvard\u2019s immense liberal community, there\u2019s no comparable baggage for campus liberals; they aren\u2019t harassed over e-mail lists or berated for any conservatives\u2019 beastly perceptions of MIT linguistics professor Noam Chomsky, Al Franken \u201873 or even Presidential hopeful Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.)\u2014and I assure you such perceptions exist.</span></p> <p><span>Thus Harvard liberals who behave this way\u2014reflexively demonizing their conservative counterparts\u2014fail to realize that liberal-conservative labeling obscures many substantial differences in personal opinions. The Moral Reasoning 22, or \u201cJustice,\u201d student critiquing John Rawls in section will forevermore be called upon to defend the \u201cconservative\u201d viewpoint in any discussion.</span></p> <p><span>But being a conservative doesn\u2019t come with automatic positions on many issues, such as drug legalization, immigration and gay marriage. Libertarian conservatives, for instance, might be inclined to support the legalization of marijuana, while social conservatives might adamantly oppose it. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial page argues for more legal immigration to bring about economic growth, while The National Review argues vehemently for a hiatus on all immigration\u2014so that immigrants already here can be culturally assimilated. Disparities within the conservative position run the gamut, and to ignore these distinctions is simply narrow-minded.</span></p> <p><span>The common perception that all conservatives think alike is closely tied to the idea of the \u201cvast right-wing conspiracy\u201d\u2014that conservatives are somehow a sinister force. It implies that there is something deeply troubling, even wrong, about their beliefs. I remember the disgusted looks I received in my Justice section: people simply couldn\u2019t believe that a Harvard student actually disagreed that taxes were an intrinsic moral good.</span></p> <p><span>Perceptions that conservatives are wrong or evil serve to justify their exclusion and marginalization at Harvard. Kenan Professor of Government Harvey C. Mansfield \u201853 recently described fellow professors for The Boston Globe: \u201cEverybody is a liberal and shows it. They conduct classes in such a way as to make conservatives feel excluded. The atmosphere is very politicized.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In order to stop this exclusion, people at Harvard must stop lumping conservatives together. Conservatives don\u2019t march in lockstep; and, we have no greater sense of ideological conformity than do our liberal brethren.</span></p> <p><span>Whether judging students in section, or berating conservative classmates and friends, Harvard liberals should start practicing more of the open-mindedness and tolerance they so often preach.</span></p> <p><span><i>Mark A.

For instance, undergraduates were instructed as to the proper type of outerwear: \u201ccoat must be of black-mixed, called also Oxford-mixed, single breasted, with a rolling cape square at the end, and with pocket flaps; waist reaching to the natural waist, with lapels of the same length; skirts reaching to the bend of the knee; three crows-feet, made of black silk cord on the lower part of the sleeve of a senior, two on that of a junior, and one on that of sophomore.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>This laundry list of requirements is a far cry from the range of men\u2019s fashions today.

Over the last decade, many men have not only tested the boundaries of coiffing with their highlighted and gelled hair, but they have also come out of the closet, so to speak, with admissions such as, \u201cyes, I tan\u201d or \u201cyes, I wax.\u201d For this certain set of men, polishing their looks\u2014and spending money to do so\u2014 is becoming an art and a science. Even the threat of being labeled feminine won\u2019t stop them in their quest for beauty (or handsomeness).</span></p> <p><span>Mike S. Goonan \u201905 takes his sweet time getting ready in the morning. \u201cThere\u2019s no point in looking frumpy when you can easily look nice,\u201d he says. His day begins with a twenty-five minute long shower with lots of shampoo, conditioner and other fragrant products. He gets out of the shower and ponders what he is going to wear for the day, not an easy\u2014or short\u2014task. \u201cFor me it depends on weather, what I\u2019ll be doing. The colors have to match, the shoes have to go with shirt, and maybe I\u2019ll be in class with someone I want to look good for,\u201d Goonan says. For the next twenty minutes, Goonan shaves and puts on lotion. Goonan spends the remaining time styling his hair, carefully working in a molding paste. \u201cPush it forward,\u201d Goonan advises. \u201cIf it looks messy, it\u2019s good.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>So why are men spending so much time and cash on their exteriors? Most of the guys would agree with Matt T. Bosch \u201907. \u201cIt\u2019s a self esteem thing,\u201d he says. The need to dress well and keep up a good appearance is paramount. Knowing that he\u2019s dressed well and in shape is an ego-boost to Goonan. \u201cI feel better about myself,\u201d he says. Girls have also started to take notice of men\u2019s need to dress for themselves. Betsy W. McCormick \u201907 says her male friends just want to feel good about themselves. \u201cIt\u2019s a self-confidence thing. You\u2019ll have a happier day if you look and feel good,\u201d she says.</span></p> <p><span>In an environment where even chance encounters are perceived as the event that could catapult a student into fame or success, it\u2019s all about first impressions.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cPhysical appearance is always what first grabs a person\u2019s attention no matter how superficial that is,\u201d says Chibo Tang \u201907.</span></p> <p><span><b>The Jean Pool expands</b></span></p> <p><span>Finding a pair of Paper Denims no longer requires a trek to Newbury. Harvard Square stores are noticing college males growing concern for their appearance and responding accordingly. Denis E. Black, manager of retail store J. Press on Mount Auburn St., agrees. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for women, men wouldn\u2019t care about dressing,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>While some men remain stoically indifferent to the au courant world of men\u2019s fashion, more are embracing their wardrobes as places of opportunity\u2014and black holes for cash. Kris J. Trujillo \u201905 says outfit-choosing is a challenge: \u201cMostly I am just dressing for myself to see what I can pull off. But other days I dress up for class or meetings,\u201d he says. Opening the door to his closet, he rattled off a list of stores where he had made his most recent purchases: Club Monaco; J. Crew; Abercrombie; Banana Republic; Hollister; Ralph Lauren; and Paul Smith were just a few.</span></p> <p><span>And while most face the task of pairing Ralph and Paul on their own, others enlist the assistance of men whose business is to pick pleats and tweak inches off inseams. Luke Mountain, a wardrobe consultant at a high end men\u2019s boutique, Louis Boston, says getting the right look is not about following outer trends as much as harnessing one\u2019s intuitions. \u201cClothing is very personal,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s really about expressing yourself and molding an image.\u201d According to Mountain, the world of women\u2019s fashion is more sensationalistic, constantly claiming what\u2019s hot and often more importantly what\u2019s not. \u201cThe men\u2019s fashion world is much slower,\u201d he says. \u201cMen generally want something they can wear and not stand out. They feel inhibited by what other people think.\u201d But just because male fashion doesn\u2019t feature what Mountain termed \u2018flamboyant peacock shows,\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean that men don\u2019t take advantage of the opportunity to flaunt a few feathers. With TV shows like Bravo\u2019s Queer Eye for the Straight Guy glorifying the newly stylish male, customers are flocking for fashion help. \u201cSometimes I really have to work from the bottom up,\u201d Mountain says. \u201cI\u2019ll want to get someone into a slimmer jean and they\u2019ll have huge boxer shorts on. Then we have to send them downstairs to try on a pair of snug fitting boxer briefs.\u201d Fashion is the kind of business in which having suitable individual items\u2014like the right undies\u2014is critical in supporting the whole package.</span></p> <p><span>But at Harvard, land of post-adolescent, pre-yuppie conformity, such a holistic view may not take root. McCormick sees the campus as a world of pink and green orthodoxy. \u201cThere are a ton of kids who come here who have been exposed to really preppy environments,\u201d she says. \u201cHarvard exacerbates that to the extreme.\u201d McCormick cites the abundance of Nantucket red and popped collars as evidence to her assertions.</span></p> <p><span>The polo phenomenon has not gone unnoticed by local shopkeepers either. Kerry C. Simon, owner of Proletariat, says that students regularly come to his JFK Street store to look for the perfect polo\u2014collar and all. \u201cThe Harvard guys are mirror whores, making sure the polo looks great in all the right places,\u201d Simon says.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Nye Decries 'Hard Power' U.S. Foreign Policy | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Allison D. Bates", "body": "<p><span>In his final days as dean of the Kennedy School of Government, Dean Joseph S. Nye told students and colleagues that the United States ought to garner international support by making its initiatives more attractive to its allies, not by force or coercion.</span></p> <p><span>Nye, who will be succeeded by Black Professor of Political Economy David T. Ellwood \u201975 this summer, spoke yesterday about the necessity of soft power, which he focused on in his 2004 book Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics.</span></p> <p><span>Speaking in Bell Hall at the Kennedy School, Nye sat around the table and finished his lunch during the casual question and answer session after the talk.</span></p> <p><span>Nye said that while he doesn\u2019t support abandoning hard power mechanisms such as military strength, he warned that the often ignored forum of soft power represents a significant threat to American security.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cYou can attract them and co-opt them to get them to want what you want,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAmerica has such an endowment of hard power that we forget we need to use our soft power,\u201d Nye said. \u201cThe U.S. has a great deal of soft power, but we\u2019ve been applying our policies in ways that make them appear arrogant and illegitimate.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>According to Nye, America\u2019s unilateralism and apparent arrogance have lost it popularity among Western European nations as well as the Islamic world.</span></p> <p><span>In the past few years the United States has lost, on average, 30 points in public opinion polls in countries like Britain, Italy and Spain, although these countries still supported the United States in the Iraq War.</span></p> <p><span>Nye said that the United States is losing even more popularity in the public opinion polls of \u201cfriendly\u201d Arab countries, like Pakistan and Jordan.</span></p> <p><span>In a poll three weeks ago, Osama bin Laden garnered more support than George W. Bush, Nye said.</span></p> <p><span>Citing the Islamic world as a significant national security threat, Nye stressed the importance of soft power as a way to avoid antagonizing moderates to extremism.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s true that soft power is not going to attract Osama bin Laden or al Qaeda. We need hard power to fight that,\u201d he said. \u201cSoft power prevents the loss of moderates to extremism. We need to give moderates an alternative vision.  It\u2019s not just whose army wins, it\u2019s whose story wins.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Nye also said that hard power policies were incapable of defeating the war on terror.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIn the case of Afghanistan, the use of American military force removed the Taliban government, it did not wrap up al Qaeda,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only way you can deal with a transnational terrorist organization, like al Qaeda, is through close civilian cooperation.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>According to Nye, neglecting soft power diplomacy will further undermine U.S. military capabilities by turning strategic allies against the United States.</span></p> <p><span>But Nye noted that the current condition is not irreparable.</span></p> <p><span>International opinion about the United States was similarly low after the Vietnam War, he said. He added that America was able to change its image by adjusting its policies and its presentation of them, exemplified by the human rights policies of former presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, which were attractive internationally.</span></p> <p><span>Shorenstein Fellow Rebecca MacKinnon \u201991 said she strongly supported Nye\u2019s arguments. She said she had developed similar opinions on international relations during her 10 years in Asia as a CNN journalist.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cDean Nye definitely has a very important point that the U.S. could be leveraging more soft power,\u201d she said.</span></p> <p><span>MacKinnon also said she agreed with Nye\u2019s desire to spread democracy without imposing it.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhen I was in China I would meet people who weren\u2019t happy with their government, who wanted democracy and freedom,\u201d she said. \u201cBut then you ask them about America and they have strong anti-American feelings. You\u2019ll frequently meet people who admire American ideals but dislike American actions.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>MacKinnon added that anti-American sentiment is much more apparent abroad than at home.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAmericans really fundamentally do not understand that other people do not like Americans. They say its the government, not the people. Yet when I was in Pakistan after 9/11, their government was our ally but the people were anti-American,\u201d she said.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Visa Applicants Deserve Better | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The United States\u2019 visa policy for foreign students is appallingly muddled\u2014leaving many students who dream of attending higher eduction in the United States waiting unfairly for months, if not years, in limbo. Still other students have been discouraged from applying. Reform is clearly needed, and University President Lawrence H. Summers should be commended for recently attempting to rectify America\u2019s wrongheaded strategy. Summers\u2019 leadership, while many others in academia remain silent, is admirable.</span></p> <p><span>In a letter addressed to Secretary of State Colin Powell and Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge, Summers urged immediate revisions of the student visa application process to avert the detrimental decline in foreign graduate students across the country. The situation has become so acute that Harvard and other institutions can no longer attract adequate numbers of foreign graduate applicants.</span></p> <p><span>In a study released in February, conducted jointly by several national organizations including the American Council of Education, the Association of American Universities and the Association of International Educators, 19 of the top 25 U.S. research institutions with the most international graduate students reported a decline in applications from international students. Of these schools, nine experienced a drop exceeding 30 percent. Of the 530 U.S. institutions surveyed, almost half received fewer international graduate applications compared to last year. Instead, many of these students are turning to countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia; schools in both of these countries experienced upsurges in foreign applicants this year.</span></p> <p><span>In his letter, Summers highlights the particular hardship science programs have experienced at Harvard and elsewhere. Visa policies have been especially stringent for students from China, India and the Middle East, where many applicants seek graduate study in science and engineering fields. The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences has seen a decline of 40 percent in applications from China alone in some of its science programs. Because of these declines, many students abroad suspect an unwelcoming climate for foreigners inside the United States\u2014a perception which has further compounded the drop in applications.</span></p> <p><span>After Sept. 11, 2001, stricter, more systematic security measures were needed to ensure the safety of Americans. After all, several of the hijackers entered United States borders using student visas. Yet a balance must be found. Currently, the State Department has swung too far away (and in too disorganized a fashion) from welcoming visitors who are essential to America\u2019s vitality, innovation and global leadership. Finding this appropriate balance is crucial, and continuing under the current framework will hurt national interests and compromise America\u2019s future. The United States accrues enormous security benefits from the higher education community by leading the world in technological innovation. Current declines in foreign graduate school applicants will undermine the position of American universities as international forums for academic exchange. And in the long run, that will jeopardize the U.S. position in the global community.</span></p> <p><span>As Summers emphasized, the State Department should clearly define timeframes for students requiring visas. At present, many international students are forced to wait in the dark for the results of their visa applications, with no indication of when the decision will be made. This indefinite delay is frustrating as many students cannot work, study or make reasonably informed decisions for their future. The Department of Homeland Security must not veil administrative disorganization with the pretense of national security. To drag their feet when students can be screened in a timely manner is unacceptable. We hope the Bush administration receives Summers\u2019 recommendations with open arms and takes decisive action to maintain the esteem of American institutions and keep this nation strong.</span></p>"}

Brown substituted to pinch run for Adams. Up next, pinch hitter Montijo singled to right field, putting runners on first and second with just one out.</span></p> <p><span>But they were unable to get any farther as two infield plays cleared the bases, stranding two Harvard runners.

Goldberg followed with a liner down the right field line, giving Harvard runners at the corners. A Montijo grounder allowed Bettinelli to come home with the only run that the Crimson would need.</span></p> <p><span>In the top of the fourth, Brotemarkle got into trouble with runners on first and second and no outs. But she induced Fry to line softly to Bettinelli at second, who doubled up pinch-runner Lacey Neahr at second base.</span></p> <p><span>The Big Green\u2019s Ashley Thorfinnson then sent a sinking line drive to right field.</span></p> <p><span>Kidder charged the ball, diving forward and to her left and making the spectacular catch to short-circuit the Dartmouth rally.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard padded its cushion in the top of the fifth. Montijo led off with a single through the left side, and sophomore center fielder Kerry Flaherty\u2019s sacrifice bunt advanced the runner.</span></p> <p><span>Kidder lofted a ball over the second baseman\u2019s head and then stole second. With two runners in scoring position, Harvard coach Jenny Allard sent Adams to the plate to pinch hit for Stefanchik. The move proved apt, as Adams blasted a towering shot to center that didn\u2019t need the aid of the strong wind that was blowing all day to clear the fence easily.</span></p> <p><span>Brotemarkle recorded the last three outs with a small measure of difficulty. After managing the first out, Brotemarkle allowed a single through the left side and then a bloop single to left that put runners at first and second. But the co-captain buckled down and struck out Kerry Conway and gave up a liner that traveled right into the glove of Kidder in right.</span></p> <p><span>Bettinelli, Kidder and Montijo each went 2-for-3, with Montijo adding an RBI and a double that smacked two-thirds up the center-field fence.</span></p> <p><span>The Crimson will play its final game of the year at 4 p.m. tomorrow at Soldiers Field against Boston College.</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff writer J.

But the Bush administration and a right-wing Congress have been working since their election to undermine the right to choose. Using tactics that, though technically legal, are underhanded at best, the president and his pals in Congress are slowly succeeding at doing what they couldn\u2019t through open debate: limit women\u2019s access to reproductive healthcare and lay the groundwork for overturning Roe v. Wade.</span></p> <p><span>It was frustration with this slow erosion of reproductive rights that filled the streets of Washington, D.C. on Sunday with over 500,000 protesters and a large contingent of Harvard students. We are glad that so many activists have mobilized to protect reproductive freedom, and we hope Americans take notice.</span></p> <p><span>The most recent, and possibly the most underhanded, anti-choice crusade has centered on the misnamed Unborn Victims of Violence Act (UVVA). The legislation was pitched as a way to provide tougher punishments for criminals, but its real purpose was to set a precedent for referring to fetuses as legal entities with legal rights. Congressional Democrats offered a separate piece of legislation that would have provided equally strong sentences for those who injure pregnant women, but pro-life members of Congress killed the legislation. They didn\u2019t want a bill that would punish criminals unless it would also help them redefine the legal status of a fetus. Congress is pretending the UVVA is about crime, not abortion, but most Americans shouldn\u2019t have any trouble figuring out how a law granting legal rights to a fetus could have a chilling effect on a woman\u2019s right to choose.</span></p> <p><span>The Partial Birth Abortion Ban is another Orwellian innovation. Don\u2019t waste your time leafing through medical textbooks for a description of partial birth abortion. The term is a political fabrication used to conjure a false image of crying babies being killed by evil doctors. The bill\u2019s title loosely refers to an extremely rare medical procedure that is used as a last resort in the second or third trimester of a pregnancy, mostly when the fetus is already dead or when the mother\u2019s life is in danger. Women\u2019s rights advocates fear that the legislation will prevent doctors from performing partial birth abortions, even when the procedure is the safest way to protect a woman\u2019s life. In their zeal to protect the rights of the fetus, pro-life members of Congress have endangered the health, and possibly the lives, of American women. This marks the first time Congress has limited a woman\u2019s right to choose since <i>Roe v. Wade</i>. It is a disturbing precedent.</span></p> <p><span>Last Sunday\u2019s march showed that Americans care about reproductive rights. We strongly support the marchers, and we hope that all who support the right to choose will stand up against reckless attempts to take that right away.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Kerry's Smart Choice for VP | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>If the rule for picking a vice-presidential running mate\u2014like the rule for modern medicine\u2014is first, do no harm, I\u2019ve got the perfect choice for Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass.: Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.</span></p> <p><span>Of course, we all know that\u2014for doctors and politicians alike\u2014things are a lot more complicated than the Hippocratic Oath. A vast constellation of criteria looms before Kerry. He could pick The Hot Choice\u2014the man or woman who would guarantee media acclaim; The Political Choice\u2014the person who would achieve a balanced, multi-ethnic, multi-ideological and multi-gendered ticket; or even the The Pander-bear Choice\u2014exciting his party base by throwing them a politician they love.</span></p> <p><span>But, to me, The Smart Choice means focusing on the factors that really matter\u2014having the courage to sacrifice a little July pizzazz in exchange for November results.</span></p> <p><span>The Smart Choice could do the following things, in ascending order. He or she could carry a state: IBM Professor of Business and Government Roger B. Porter, who teaches Government 1540, \u201cThe American Presidency,\u201d says modern vice-presidential candidates typically add about three percent to the ticket\u2019s vote in their home state. Kerry\u2019s ideal candidate, then, should come from a state that will swing on a few percentage points.</span></p> <p><span>The Smart Choice could also be president. One way or another, about one in five vice presidents have become commander-in-chief. And, since Walter Mondale, all vice presidents have played a significant role in the political scene after their terms ended. In wartime, voters will only replace the incumbent if the alternative is ready to lead. A steady, experienced running mate could make change feel a bit less risky.</span></p> <p><span>He or she could also reflect good qualities. Kerry\u2019s choice\u2014timed before the conventions and the debates\u2014will be a sledgehammer to the wall separating Kerry and the voters. It will be the first major stage of the Democratic effort to define who this man is. Kerry\u2019s pick will communicate the qualities and values that Kerry believes are most important\u2014and that would ultimately define a Kerry presidency.</span></p> <p><span>Finally, The Smart Choice should do no harm. Yes\u2014despite everything else\u2014this is still most important aspect of all. If a running mate has some dark secret in his past\u2014a mistress, a felony, rehab\u2014he will be a liability. Unless the choice is almost inhumanly scandal-free, nothing else matters. Senator Kerry, you could object to this rule, you could (rightly) argue that it drives many qualified, capable people out of public life. But ignore it at your peril.</span></p> <p><span>Gephardt passes all these tests. President Bush carried Missouri in 2000\u2014but by less than three percent. No one could seriously question Gephardt\u2019s experience, competence or character\u2014the former House Democratic leader could walk in the Oval Office and be president tomorrow. And the still-boyish 62-year-old carries all the controversy of a Hallmark card\u2014not a smidgen of scandal in 30 years of public life. He is still one of the best-liked, most widely respected leaders of either party. Gephardt could match Vice President Cheney\u2019s stature in a debate, and then beat him with an economic appeal to his fellow middle-class Midwesterners. More than that, Gephardt would make a superb vice president: a bridge to Congress, a leader on national security, a sounding board on the concerns of working Americans.</span></p> <p><span>In the end, the old saying, \u201cnobody votes for vice president,\u201d will still hold true: This is the presidential candidates\u2019 race to win or lose. But, then again, nothing is more presidential than recruiting a deputy who could be president too.</span></p> <p><span><i>Brian M.

{"title": "Harvard, God and the Petri Dish | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>In labs across the globe, a biological \u201cspace race\u201d of sorts is pitting nation against nation in a competition to uncover the therapeutic potential of stem cells. Only this time, the foreign competitors are way ahead.</span></p> <p><span>In February, South Korean scientists successfully extracted a line of stem cells from a cloned human embryo, a Sputnik-sized embarrassment for U.S. researchers. Stymied by the Bush administration\u2019s 2001 prohibition on federal funds for research on newly-created stem cell lines, American scientists have long been confronted by an unattractive choice\u2014use scarce, sometimes inferior government-approved stem cell lines or strike out alone without any federal cash.</span></p> <p><span>Thanks to the efforts of private donors, however, U.S. research into the creation of new stem cell lines has continued\u2014albeit at a reduced pace. Harvard, to its credit, has led this push. In March, Cabot Professor of the Natural Sciences Douglas A. Melton made 17 new stem cell lines freely available for private use. And last week, Harvard unveiled plans for a new stem cell center aimed at coordinating the University\u2019s research in the area. Funded privately to circumvent government restrictions, the center will help to quicken the pace of American stem cell research.</span></p> <p><span>And in this line of research, which involves potential cures for life-threatening diseases, pace matters. Stem cell research may be the key to understanding and treating many currently untreatable maladies like Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, diabetes and spinal cord injuries. Harvard\u2019s vision\u2014and decision to forge ahead despite short-sighted federal restrictions\u2014is good for the University and good for humanity.</span></p> <p><span>So it is a shame that so few of America\u2019s elected leaders comprehend these long-term benefits.</span></p> <p><span>The Massachusetts legislature recently stripped a provision declaring the state\u2019s support for stem cell research from an economic stimulus bill passed last fall. Pro-life groups and lobbyists for the Catholic Church engineered the move\u2014falsely equating therapeutic cloning with abortion.</span></p> <p><span>But therapeutic cloning, which destroys embryos consisting of no more than a few cells, is a fundamentally different process from abortion. Therapeutic cloning happens in the lab, not in the womb. Whereas opponents of stem cell research see life in a few cells smeared in a petri dish, we see the millions of human lives which will be saved through stem cell treatments\u2014even if these treatments only live up to the most conservative hopes of researchers.</span></p> <p><span>Government, be it state or federal, should not impede the vast medical advances stem cell research promises. Thankfully, federal funding restrictions have not stopped the creation of new stem cell lines entirely. The Bush administration should recognize the ineffectiveness of its regulations on stem cell research and open up government grants to all, and the Massachusetts legislature should jump at the chance to ensure that this state, with its wealth of academic institutions, remains at the center of a medical revolution. Harvard and other private American research institutions have shown the vision; it\u2019s time for America\u2019s elected leaders to embrace it.</span></p>"}
{"title": "The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The Kirkland House Junior Common Room last Wednesday evening was carefully arranged for a political event. Students filled couches situated on the oriental rugs; a microphone and two chairs sat beneath the House crest. Within a few minutes, a man emerged to applause and began an informal question-and-answer session, in which he urged students to make the right choice come November.</span></p> <p><span>But for once, the guest speaker was no glad-handing, suited D.C. operative: it was Stephen Stills, the folk-rock icon of the 1960s and 70s. He delayed taking out his guitar in order to first sing the praises of Sen. John F. Kerry\u2014and proved that music and political idealism are still perfect bedmates.</span></p> <p><span>Anyone with a car radio or a baby-boomer parent has likely heard the political platforms of Stephen Stills\u2014they just don\u2019t realize it. His riffs play over and over again on \u201cclassic rock\u201d stations, but his name rings bells only when grouped with those of David Crosby, Graham Nash and sometimes Neil Young. And while listeners may whistle the tune from \u201cSuite: Judy Blue Eyes,\u201d the smash single Stills penned, they don\u2019t realize that they\u2019re singing the catch phrases of radical politics. Take another listen: after seven-odd minutes of folky guitar licks, pitch-perfect harmonies and snatches of soul-baring poetry, Stills starts crooning something in Spanish about Cuba.</span></p> <p><span>In 1969, when that song soared to the top of the charts, Fidel was the enemy and the Cold War was getting uncomfortably hot in Vietnam and elsewhere. Ten years later, Stills controversially followed through on the message behind those seemingly carefree words he\u2019d once sung\u2014he rocked Havana\u2019s Karl Marx Theatre in a historic Cuban-American music festival.</span></p> <p><span>For years, as a solo artist and as part of several iconic groups, Stills has mixed politics with rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. He electrified Woodstock and lit up the Berlin Wall as it fell. Speaking at Harvard might be a high point for most public speakers, but for Stills it was more like a night off.</span></p> <p><span>Stills has put on some weight since his days as a member of Buffalo Springfield, Manassas and Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young (CSNY), and lost some hearing after decades on the road in front of a stack of amps. Audience members frequently had to repeat their questions as Stills left his seat and approached them, cocking his ear to catch even a snippet of the questions asked. But he has the same sharp intelligence that captivated listeners in the Summer of Love, the same earnest dedication to peace, justice and cool that came through on so many not-quite-protest songs in those years. It took Stills a while to warm to the students gathered in the Kirkland JCR, but by the end of the question-and-answer session\u2014when, he said afterwards, he felt he and the audience \u201cknew each other\u201d\u2014the aging guitar star brought out his acoustic to play two impromptu tunes, stretching his dulled but still bright voice to hit the high notes, entirely solo. If his lively talk had left any doubt about the power Stills has to inspire a crowd, his music quickly dashed it with the first finger-picked chords.</span></p> <p><span><b>Stills After All These Years</b></span></p> <p><span>Retreating to the considerably more low-key Senior Common Room, Stills remained a bit ill at ease, preferring not to talk until there was complete silence so he could collect his thoughts. But once he got going, he could hardly stop, holding court with a constant stream of wisecracks, anecdotes and wisdom on music and politics.</span></p> <p><span>Stills said he was convinced, first and foremost, that musicians have a place stumping for a presidential nominee. Asked what power music can hold in this polarized election year, with apocalyptic visions disseminated and dissected by both sides, the two-time Rock and Roll Hall-of-Famer answered immediately: music can \u201cmake people feel something besides fear.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Using music as a kind of window on the soul, Stills began to breathe liberal fire. What kind of music does he think President Bush listens to after a hard day in the situation room? \u201cI don\u2019t think he does,\u201d Stills declared. \u201cI think it\u2019s apparent that he doesn\u2019t\u2014at least, not voluntarily. He may listen to hymns in church.\u201d A few wry seconds later, he is quipping that Bush \u201cprobably thought The Beatles were cool at first, until they turned all Commie on him.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Stills\u2019 candidate of choice, on the other hand, recently professed his fascination with hip-hop music (\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of anger, a lot of social energy in it,\u201d Kerry told an MTV reporter in March, \u201cand I think you\u2019d better listen to it pretty carefully, \u2019cause it\u2019s important\u201d), and is known to have played bass with prep-school surf band The Electras. Last year, the Washington Post reported that Kerry was taking classical guitar lessons and slipping in a bit of those same Beatles (\u201cYesterday,\u201d from a time right before the decidedly-Commie <i>Rubber Soul</i> but not so long after the proud capitalism of <i>With the Beatles</i>). Has Stills, keystone of many a supergroup, ever considered setting up a mean jam session with the man he\u2019s voting for in November?</span></p> <p><span>\u201c\u2018The artist rolls his eyes,\u2019\u201d he meta-narrated. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason John [Kerry] has never taken his guitar out in front of me. He skis with me, because I\u2019m bad,\u201d Stills said.</span></p> <p><span>And what about the prospect of playing with another Democrat whose candidacy Stills vocally supported\u2014Bill Clinton, he of the sunglasses and saxophone?</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI know all about sax players,\u201d the smiling songwriter said. \u201cSax players are only comfortable in a couple of keys, and those are bad for guitar. You can make a big mistake playing with the horn player.\u201d He added that he preferred literary discussions to musical collaborations when it came to the man from Hope.</span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile, Stills was amused to hear of a pundit\u2019s primary-season analogy comparing Kerry to John Lennon, Sen. John R. Edwards to Paul McCartney and former Vermont Gov. Howard B. Dean to George Harrison\u2014but troubled to hear that commentator\u2019s equation of Rep. Dennis J. Kucinich with final Beatle Ringo Starr.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cRingo\u2019s much funnier than that,\u201d Stills explained. \u201cAl Sharpton\u2019s Ringo.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Of course, any aging boomer could spend days playing at matching the Fab Four to his favorite political horses. But only Stills and a few other elite rockers can back up the Starr-Sharpton connection with a quick disclaimer: \u201cI know Ringo very, very well, and they\u2019re a lot alike,\u201d he added.</span></p> <p><span>Stills wasted no time, of course, in denying any political ambitions of his own. \u201cOh my God, no,\u201d he cried. \u201cAnd have people dig up all that shit? Unless, of course, I ran into an Arnold Schwarzenegger situation\u2014what celebrity couldn\u2019t win if he only had to run for two months?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>And despite his twin passions for making music and social justice, Stills has no trouble choosing between the two.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d he exclaimed upon being asked which kind of performance he preferred. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing cooler than getting in front of a lot of people and playing the dogshit out of a guitar.\u201d</span></p>"}

{"title": "Shameless | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>A couple of months ago, a friend complained that my columns were too focused on AIDS. He told me to mix it up more. Well, I\u2019ve tried, and I\u2019ve failed\u2014the Bush administration\u2019s recent efforts to block access to cheap generic AIDS medications are simply too shameless to ignore. But I don\u2019t want to pigeonhole this story as just an \u201cAIDS\u201d issue. Think of it as the ultimate Bush administration case study: an inside look at how a cynical White House policy is undermining a prestigious multilateral institution, wasting taxpayer dollars, and jeopardizing thousands\u2014potentially even millions\u2014of lives by subordinating good science to corporate special interests.</span></p> <p><span>Our story begins last year, when President Bush announced the creation of the President\u2019s Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). One of PEPFAR\u2019s central planks is treatment, namely putting 2 million people onto anti-retroviral AIDS medicines by 2008. But not all anti-retrovirals are created equal. Today, the administration faces a critical choice\u2014whether to allow PEPFAR grantees to purchase generic three-in-one fixed dose combination (FDCs) therapies.</span></p> <p><span>By all rights, the choice should be simple\u2014generic FDCs have significant advantages over the brand-name alternatives. First and foremost, they are much cheaper. The group M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res currently procures generic FDCs for its treatment programs at a cost of about $280 per patient per year. By contrast, the cheapest brand name anti-retrovirals sell for $562, or twice as much. This gap will soon double\u2014the Clinton Foundation last month negotiated an agreement with generic manufacturers to supply FDCs to developing nations for as little as $140 per year. If these price differentials don\u2019t seem like a big deal, consider the human cost: PEPFAR has a tightly capped budget, so buying more expensive brand-name drugs means buying fewer drugs\u2014two to four times fewer drugs. That means two to four times fewer individuals will receive access to lifesaving drugs; they\u2019ll be given a death sentence instead.</span></p> <p><span>FDCs are also preferable from a therapeutic perspective. Where brand names drugs require patients to adhere to a complicated regime of six pills per day, FDCs allow for a simplified regime of two pills per day. This increases rates of adherence which in turn reduces the risk of viral mutation and the emergence of drug-resistant strains of HIV.</span></p> <p><span>Yet despite these compelling advantages, the Bush administration refuses to authorize the purchase of FDCs. This is a little suspicious\u2014the pharmaceutical industry is a huge contributor to and close ally of President Bush, and they stand to lose big if he green-lights generic FDCs. In addition to losing lucrative contracts, they fear that their long-term profit margins will suffer if generic manufacturers continue to gain greater international legitimacy and clout.</span></p> <p><span>But let\u2019s not get carried away by conspiracy theories. The administration\u2019s opposition to FDCs is surely driven by nobler aims. Testifying before Congress, the President\u2019s Global AIDS Coordinator Randall L. Tobias, asserted that generic AIDS drugs \u201cmay well be perfectly safe and perfectly effective...and then again, they may not be. The problem is, there is no process, no principles, no standards in place today, from a regulatory point of view, to make that assurance.\u201d  A compelling argument, if only it were true. Tobias\u2019 testimony conveniently ignores the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) expert drug review and prequalification system, which, as Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., aptly put it, \u201cconstitutes a process, includes principles, and sets standards.\u201d What\u2019s more: the two generic FDCs in question, Triviro and Triomune, have both been approved through the WHO\u2019s pre-qualification process.</span></p> <p><span>The administration now maintains that WHO certification is not satisfactory and has busied itself erecting onerous regulatory obstacles to block FDC approval. The irony is that for years, the U.N., the World Bank, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and even the U.S. government itself have used WHO certification as a basis for their drug procurement policies. That\u2019s because the WHO approval process is extremely rigorous. In fact, the additional regulatory conditions proposed by the administration exceed current FDA protocols.</span></p> <p><span>The FDCs controversy is quickly becoming a black-eye for the White House. When the United States convened an international conference in Botswana to discuss the issue last month, the European Union\u2019s leading drug regulatory authority boycotted the meeting. Congresspersons, including independent-minded Republican sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., Lincoln Chafee, R-R.I., and Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, have signed open letters criticizing the administration\u2019s stance.</span></p> <p><span>Now that it\u2019s beginning to feel some heat, the administration is reassessing its alternatives. The latest news is that they\u2019re working to construct an expedited FDA approval process that could sanction FDC procurement in a matter of months. We\u2019ll see. It is unlikely that any such process will be set up before September, at the earliest. In any case, establishing a parallel approval process to the WHO\u2019s is not the solution. This would just pave the way for political interference in future scientific decisions and, as Waxman notes, lead to \u201cconflicting international standards, confusing countries and donors.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The Bush Administration needs to end this deadly charade. I\u2019d have more respect for Tobias and the President if they dropped all the pretense about \u201csafety and efficacy,\u201d stopped trying to undermine the WHO and just admitted that they\u2019re really acting to protect pharmaceutical industry interests. Then the American people could see the issue as it really stands, and they could decide for themselves whether to put drug company profits before human lives.</span></p> <p><span><i>Sasha Post \u201905 is a social studies concentrator in Adams House.

Kennedy Jr. Forum last night.</span></p> <p><span>A longtime activist and academic, Ashrawi served as minister of higher education under the Palestinian Authority until 1998, when she resigned in protest of corruption. She then founded the Palestinian Initiative for the Promotion of Global Dialogue and Democracy, in which she has since served as secretary-general.</span></p> <p><span>Ashrawi spoke of the urgency of reviving the stalled peace process, after years of violence that have taken the lives of thousands. She vigorously criticized the government of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon for what she called its \u201creoccupation\u201d of Palestinian land, its disengagement plan in the Gaza strip, its construction of a separation wall in the West Bank, and its failure to renew multilateral peace efforts.</span></p> <p><span>Ashrawi also expressed her opposition to Bush administration policies in the region, ranging from its roadmap plan to what she called \u201ca mutual admiration society between Bush and Sharon.\u201d She cited a \u201cknowledge and foresight deficit\u201d in U.S. foreign policy, and said \u201cthe United States has become an overt partner in Israel\u2019s occupation of Palestine.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The criticism was not reserved for the Israelis and Americans, however. Ashrawi reprehended the Palestinian Authority, saying that it had \u201cfailed its own people.\u201d She urged free elections and an \u201cagenda of both peace and democracy\u201d in the region. And, in response to a challenge from an audience member, she condemned suicide bombings and the targeting of Israeli civilians.</span></p> <p><span>She went on to say that it was \u201cequally horrible to have an F-16 shell an apartment. There is an equal value to all human lives.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Some members of the audience were not satisfied with her response. \u201cEquating Israeli actions against terror with Palestinian suicide bombings is morally reprehensible,\u201d said David B.

{"title": "Softball Loses Marathon Final Game to BC | Sports | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The Harvard softball seniors just didn\u2019t want the game to end.</span></p> <p><span>In the team\u2019s final contest  of the year, and the seniors\u2019 last game, the Crimson (22-20-1, 7-5 Ivy) fell to a tough Boston College (31-21, 9-9 Big East) squad 5-2 in 13 innings.</span></p> <p><span>For six innings, Harvard had held the Eagles scoreless and allowed only three hits. With a 2-0 lead and co-captain ace Kara Brotemarkle coming to the circle to close the seventh inning, it appeared that the Crimson would finally take one from their cross-town rivals.</span></p> <p><span>But Ashley Obrest, the inning\u2019s first batter, sent Brotemarkle\u2019s offering over the fence in left for a lead-halving home run.</span></p> <p><span>Brotemarkle dropped her head and took off her glove, while sophomore catcher Erin Halpenny and coach Jenny Allard came out to calm her.</span></p> <p><span>Still flustered, Brotemarkle walked the next batter, Erin Mackey, and Sara Kellner came in to run.</span></p> <p><span>After a sacrifice bunt moved Kellner to second, Elise Meredith sent a hard grounder to co-captain second baseman Sara Williamson and all hell broke loose.</span></p> <p><span>Williamson fielded the ball cleanly, but her throw to junior Cecily Gordon at first was low. Unable to come up with the toss, Gordon went to the ground to grab the rolling ball.</span></p> <p><span>By the time she had it in her hand, Meredith was safe at first, and Kellner had rounded third and was heading home.</span></p> <p><span>Gordon popped up and threw to Halpenny at the plate, but the ball arrived late and Kellner scored the game-tying run. Halpenny then gunned down Meredith, who was attempting to move to second amid the action at home.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI screwed up,\u201d Williamson said, \u201cand cost my team the game.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Brotemarkle got Elena Ferrero to fly out to sophomore center fielder Kerry Flaherty to keep the score tied and give the offense a chance to take back the game in the bottom of the inning.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAfter they scored that second run, all I wanted to do was stop them from scoring any more,\u201d Brotemarkle said.</span></p> <p><span>Leading off, Williamson hit the ball right on the nose, but right at BC\u2019s left fielder.</span></p> <p><span>Halpenny grounded out, but senior shortstop Rachel Goldberg worked an 0-2 count to 2-2 and then dumped a single into left. Freshman Julia Kidder, solid all year, came up with a clutch shot into center that put runners on first and second with two outs.</span></p> <p><span>The game went to extra frames, however, when junior left fielder Lauren Stefanchik popped up to the third baseman.</span></p> <p><span>In the top of the eighth, the Eagles had a quick chance to take the lead with runners on second and third and one out, but Brotemarkle buckled down and induced the next two BC batters into weak fly balls.</span></p> <p><span>Junior Lauren Bettinelli came in to relieve Brotemarkle in the tenth, and immediately benefited from slick fielding by Goldberg and Stefanchik, who each made great plays to keep runners of the base paths. Bettinelli had started the game for Harvard and went four scoreless innings before giving way to freshman Becky Voaklander in the fifth.</span></p> <p><span>Both teams went in short order the next two innings.</span></p> <p><span>Then in the top of the 13th, Kimmy Hopkin popped up to Goldberg and Jenna Macchi walked. Jacqui Goodchild sent a sacrifice drag bunt to Goldberg, who threw her out at first. With two outs, Britney Thompson walked, and Obrest again inflicted pain on the Crimson, tattooing a shot to left center that one hopped the fence and scored Macchi. With runners on second and third, Erin Mackey singled to center and drove in both Thompson and Obrest, giving the Eagles the final 5-2 margin.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cSometimes you play your hearts out, and the ball falls just fair, and you want it to fall just foul,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cBut the game went to 13 innings and we fought hard.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Harvard got on the board in the second inning, as sophomore third baseman Rachel Murray reached on an error. Freshman Lauren Brown pinch ran, and advanced to second on a sac bunt from Bettinelli. Williamson then knocked her in with a double to center.</span></p> <p><span>The very next inning the Crimson struck again. After Stefanchik lined a single up the middle, Gordon blasted a rocket through the right side, and Stefanchik didn\u2019t break her stride coming around second and sliding into third. Gordon promptly stole second to put two runners in scoring position.</span></p> <p><span>Senior Monica Montijo pinch hitting for junior designated player Annie Dell\u2019Aria, served a single to left that plated Stefanchik and moved Gordon to third.</span></p> <p><span>In an attempt to get into a rundown and allow Gordon to score from third, Montijo made a half-hearted steal try, but ran too close to the second baseman, who tagged Montijo for the second out. Murray then popped out to short left for the third out.</span></p> <p><span>For Harvard\u2019s four seniors\u2014Brotemarkle, Williamson, Goldberg, and Montijo\u2014this final game was their final day in a Crimson uniform.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s a sick feeling,\u201d Brotemarkle said. \u201cI\u2019m going to miss it.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff writer J.

{"title": "Simply Staggering | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Paul Bremer\u2019s past life came back to haunt him last Sunday. On February 26, 2001, after chairing the Clinton-appointed National Commission on Terrorism, Bremer remarked in a speech, \u201cThe new administration seems to be paying no attention to the problem of terrorism. What they will do is stagger along until there\u2019s a major incident and then suddenly say, \u2018Oh, my God, shouldn\u2019t we be organized to deal with this?\u2019\u201d When the quote resurfaced last weekend, the prescient proconsul hastily apologized for his earlier foresight, saying his criticism of Bush had been \u201cunfair.\u201d (Read: \u201cinopportune in light of the impending election.\u201d)</span></p> <p><span>That same day, The New York Times ran a story headlined \u201cKerry Struggling to Find a Theme,\u201d the latest of many such stories floating around the media. Here\u2019s a theme Kerry could try: \u201cJohn Kerry: He Doesn\u2019t Have His Head in the Sand.\u201d After all, the Bush administration\u2019s failure to respond to the mounting evidence of an imminent al Qaeda attack in 2001 is only one example of a pattern of chronic negligence towards foreseeable disasters.</span></p> <p><span>I\u2019m not just talking about the lack of planning for post-war Iraq (although the administration can boast of such boneheaded decisions as disbanding the Iraqi security forces immediately after the invasion). Bush is also turning a blind eye to the huge deficits projected over the rest of the decade and the danger of a fiscal crunch when America\u2019s credit lines dry up. Instead of facing up to the rising tide of red ink, Bush is pressing for his tax cuts to be made permanent, while congressional Republicans have killed attempts to revive the \u201cpay as you go\u201d budget rules of the Clinton era. And that\u2019s not the only rising tide Bush has ignored. The president\u2019s alternative to the Kyoto protocol consists of voluntary emission standards for industry, no caps on carbon dioxide emissions and more research on whether this whole global warmification thing that the International Panel on Climate Change and the National Academy of Sciences keep goin\u2019 on about really exists.</span></p> <p><span>The administration has also underestimated (or \u201cmisunderestimated\u201d) the long-run security risk posed by the AIDS crisis. The $15 billion AIDS initiative is a step in the right direction, but its implementation was delayed for a year through bureaucratic bungling, and now the administration is wasting funds on overpriced vaccines from U.S. companies when cheaper generic substitutes are available for a fraction of the price. The United Nations AIDS program, UNAIDS, predicts that by 2010, the AIDS epidemic will have left 20 million African children orphaned. If rebel groups or terrorist organizations manage to recruit even a small percentage of these desperate and exploitable youths, we\u2019ll have a regional and international security fiasco on our hands.</span></p> <p><span>So back to our original question, how can Kerry get his groove back? (Because let\u2019s face it, the Kerry campaign is still in its larval stage.) The senator from Massachusetts should offer a positive alternative to Bush\u2019s-head-up-his-arsenal obliviousness with an agenda that faces our responsibility to future generations. The best place to start would be to launch a Global War on Poverty to preempt the security threats of the 21st century.</span></p> <p><span>The United States is dead last among industrialized nations in foreign aid expenditure as a percentage of GNP (0.14 percent). By committing to a serious development assistance program, we could substantially undercut the wellsprings of terrorism. Economic growth would help more of the world\u2019s poor afford AIDS vaccines (even the generic ones cost over $100 a year) and could prevent the nightmare scenario of millions of orphans ripe for recruitment by militants. Development would also enable weak states\u2014debilitated by meager tax revenues, a dearth of human capital and rampant corruption\u2014to improve their domestic security. Unable to uphold basic law and order throughout much of their territory, weak states can become safe havens for terrorists. Those with materials useful for making WMD\u2014such as the nuclear stockpiles in the ex-Soviet states\u2014often lack the resources to secure those materials (and to pay guards enough to keep them from supplementing their income by selling a little plutonium or anthrax on the side). Such \u201cloose nukes\u201d and other deadly materials are at risk of falling into terrorist hands. Over many decades, a substantial investment in the economic development of the world\u2019s poorest countries would yield dividends in the form of a safer world.</span></p> <p><span>With this kind of forward-looking initiative, Kerry could draw a sharp contrast between himself and his short-sighted rival, and begin to define his campaign. While Kerry has been soul searching, Dubya has tried to brand him as a \u201cflip-flopper.\u201d (This from the man who told us four years ago, \u201cI don\u2019t think our troops ought to be used for what\u2019s called \u2018nation-building\u2019.\u201d) Kerry ought to fight back with a moniker fit for Bush. \u201cAsleep at the wheel,\u201d a phrase we have heard many times during these past few weeks of Senate hearings, is actually a fair description of Bush\u2019s record on everything from global terrorism to global warming. If Kerry dares to call the president on his somnambulant stewardship, Bush may be in for a rude awakening come November.</span></p> <p><span><i>Eoghan W.

She said that she was uncertain of what career to take and had studied biology, psychology and even architecture at the Career Discovery Program at the Harvard School of Design, before taking a job at a pharmaceutical company.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI just called up CNN one day [and they said], well you can be a non-paying intern if you pass a test,\u201d she said.  Bakhtiar, who Lycos ranked last August as the news personality whose name was most searched online, received the internship and said she \u201cstarted getting promoted like crazy.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>She was soon noticed by the CNN CEO who, according to Bakhtiar, told her, \u201cyou\u2019re too pretty to be behind camera\u2014you should be in front.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But Bakhtiar told the audience of about 75 that being an anchor has been challenging at times.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe past few days [have been] a tough time to be a anchor,\u201d she said, referring to the Iraq prison abuse scandal.</span></p> <p><span>While she described the photos of abuse as \u201chorrendous,\u201d she said that she hoped that Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld would not resign.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI\u2019ve read Donald Rumsfeld\u2019s biography and he is an incredible human being,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is a brilliant strategic planner. Being in the middle of war, I would imagine that Bush would want someone like Rumsfeld on his side.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But Bakhtiar added that she would not be surprised if he were forced to resign.</span></p> <p><span>Bakhtiar, who was on the air live during the Sept. 11 attacks, said she welcomed the ouster of Saddam Hussein but criticized the Bush administration for not having a post-war plan.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt blows my mind that there was no game plan,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that the danger is that it will become another Iran, the Islamic Republic of Iraq.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Despite the thrill of narrating the news, Bakhtiar said that she sometimes has doubts about being an anchor.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI haven\u2019t gone anywhere in a year and a half. [I\u2019m] hoping I\u2019ll go back into the field,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel pigeon-holed right now.

{"title": "Seeing is Believing | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Wilfred Owen and Donald Rumsfeld have next to nothing in common, but Owen\u2019s most important poem and Rumsfeld\u2019s most important Senate testimony Friday share the same controlling nuance.</span></p> <p><span>A leading figure among the \u201cWar Poets\u201d of the World War I era, the battle-scarred Owen wrote of the hollowness of war, set against the promises of glory told to the young. His poem about the victim of a gas attack in the trenches ends in an arresting stanza:</span></p> <p><span>In all my dreams before my helpless sight / He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning. / If in some smothering dreams, you too could pace / Behind the wagon that we flung him in, / And watch the white eyes writhing in his face, / His hanging face, like a devil\u2019s sick of sin\u2026.My friend, you would not tell with such high zest / To children ardent for some desperate glory / The old Lie: Dulce et decorum est / Pro patria mori.</span></p> <p><span>The nuance of the poem is that \u201cwatching\u201d the death, the \u201csight\u201d of it, not just knowing that it happened, makes all the difference. Everyone knew what was going on in the trenches, but few at home had actually seen it, and the rest were singing the glories of war uninhibited.</span></p> <p><span>Enter Donald Rumsfeld, explaining to the Senate why there are photographs of American soldiers torturing Iraqi detainees. Faced with the fact that the Pentagon knew about these abuses in January, he tried to explain why he and the president have become shocked, horrified, etc., only in May. \u201cIt is the photographs,\u201d he said. \u201cWords don\u2019t do it. The words that there were abuses, that it was cruel, that it was inhumane, all of which is true, that it was blatant, you read that and it\u2019s one thing. You see the photographs, and you get a sense of it, and you cannot help but be outraged.\u201d For Rumsfeld, as for Owen, what matters is not what you know but what you see. This is not a crisis about torture. This is a crisis about photographs of torture.</span></p> <p><span>On some level, we should not be shocked by the abuse. If you pause to actually think what happens during war, even \u201cmodern war,\u201d this is on the milder end of the scale. In a war, limbs are severed, heads are crushed. Children are mangled beyond the recognition even of their parents, and parents are charred alive before the eyes of their children. All of this has happened in Iraq\u2014not because Americans are evil, but because war is the ultimate doer of evil.</span></p> <p><span>If you don\u2019t appreciate this, it\u2019s not because you haven\u2019t been told. It\u2019s because you haven\u2019t been shown. But the Arab world has. For more than a year, while we watch fireworks shows over that river in Baghdad and think that we know what a war looks like, Arab viewers have seen footage of the bodies of Iraqi children who had the misfortune of coming between a bomb and its target. Look closely at American complaints about al-Jazeera, and you will find that most objections are not about inaccurate reporting or unfairness, but rather about editorial decisions to show graphic photos\u2014images which American journalists are either reluctant to show or unable to obtain. Last week\u2019s photos are America\u2019s first taste of what scholars describe as \u201cThe al-Jazeera Effect\u201d whenever some well-intentioned American reporter asks why those Arabs are so very angry all the time.</span></p> <p><span>Seeing is believing, so much so that crises happen only after the fact, after the images come in. It\u2019s enough to make a postmodern literary critic explode: things which happened in the past are not going to become real until the future, when the photographs and videos bring them into our present. President Bush and Dick Cheney may not have seen the Vietnam War, but they have seen enough pictures of it to know the power of images. They know that the best way to prevent something that has already happened is to make sure no one sees it. That\u2019s how you get a policy against photographing caskets, and a military begging CBS not to air its photographs of prisoner abuse. If people see these things, the victims will be disaggregated from numbers back into people, and America could have second thoughts about having chosen this war.</span></p> <p><span>In the hearings we learned that there is more to the abuse story on the way\u2014in the words of Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., \u201cwe\u2019re talking about rape and murder and some very serious charges.\u201d But the story is not being reported in terms of further abuse that has happened, but rather photos (and possibly videos) that will come out in the future. Any homicides in the prison are described in this quasi-future tense, because they will come to have happened only after people see photographs.</span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile, a British reporter has videotape showing American soldiers deliberately shooting a wounded Iraqi from a helicopter as he crawls out from under a flaming truck, which is a war crime under the Geneva Conventions. But for all practical purposes, this war crime hasn\u2019t occurred...yet. In the U.S., the video has aired only on ABC, and so far the obscurity of this story is a weird mimicry of the prisoner abuse revelations, which had aired on CBS almost a full week before the issue exploded onto front pages and presidential announcements of shock. If you haven\u2019t seen it yet, it\u2019s as though it didn\u2019t happen. If the images are adequately controlled, perhaps the shooting can be prevented from happening, even though it occurred in December.</span></p> <p><span>Rumsfeld may be full of just the kind of \u201chigh zest\u201d that Owen decries, but both of them understood the power of imagery. With the New York Times calling for his resignation, Washington is buzzing about Donald Rumsfeld\u2019s fate. Whatever it is, it will be better than Wilfred Owen\u2019s. An English officer, he wrote those lines while recovering from wounds in 1917. Once healed, he returned to the front, 25 years old, to be killed on the battlefield one week before Armistice.</span></p> <p><span><i>Peter P.M.

{"title": "Remember the Iraqis | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The role of the American soldier has stood in great prominence since the invasion of Iraq more than a year ago. Both those in favor and against the war have referred back to the welfare of American troops as a critical point of discussion: Some have used it to justify universal, unwavering support of the war. Others, however, see the continual risking of young American lives as key proof that Iraq has indeed become what Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., called \u201cGeorge Bush\u2019s Vietnam.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>What has surprisingly been given minimal exposure, in comparison, is the fate of the other party in this war\u2014that is, the Iraqis that American troops were sent in to defeat and/or liberate. That is, until recently.</span></p> <p><span>A couple of weeks ago, disturbing photographs were circulated around the globe that showed American soldiers at the Abu Ghraib prison outside of Baghdad engaging in malicious torture and sexual humiliation of Iraqi prisoners. Yet, in addressing the atrocities, President Bush said curtly: \u201cI think they\u2019ll be taken care of.\u201d His sentiment was similar to that voiced by New York Post editor-in-chief Col Allan, who refused to publish pictures of the abused Iraqi prisoners. Allan reasoned: \u201cIf there\u2019s a handful of U.S. soldiers who\u2019ve mistreated prisoners, I don\u2019t think that should be allowed to reflect poorly on the 140,000 men and women over there who are risking their lives and doing a good job.\u201d No wonder the Post is notoriously aligned with the president.</span></p> <p><span>Allan\u2019s concerns, while understandable, dangerously miss the point. To be sure, those who have chosen to serve their country still warrant national support and admiration for their courage. But criticism of American military action doesn\u2019t detract from the larger merits of the troops\u2014nor does prevailing heroism make it okay to ignore obvious wrongdoings.</span></p> <p><span>The photographs taken at the Abu Ghraib prison reveal American soldiers laughing and taunting naked Iraqis and forcing them into humiliating sexual positions. One photo showed seven naked men piled in a human pyramid; others revealed male prisoners being forced to masturbate and simulate oral sex with each other.</span></p> <p><span>These antics were not only cruel, but also particularly insensitive to Arab culture. Bernard Haykel, professor of Middle Eastern studies at New York University, explained in the April 30 issue of the New Yorker, that the severity of these actions is compounded by the nature of Islamic law, which prohibits homosexual acts. \u201cBeing put on top of each other and forced to masturbate, being naked in front of each other\u2014it\u2019s all a form of torture,\u201d said Haykel.</span></p> <p><span>If these photographs represented an isolated incident, it would have been bad enough. But it seems that this incident falls into a larger, almost routine, trend of abuse. At a hearing for Sergeant Ivan L. Frederick II\u2014one of six members of an Army Reserve military police unit at the Abu Ghraib prison now facing prosecution on charges of conspiracy, cruelty toward prisoners, maltreatment and indecent acts\u2014it was revealed that no specific restrictions were ever set on what could, and could not, be done to prisoners. It has since come to light that Frederick once hit a prisoner in the chest so hard that the prisoner nearly went into cardiac arrest.</span></p> <p><span>It\u2019s clear that \u201cBush\u2019s Vietnam\u201d has been no exception to the trend of engaging in dehumanizing behavior in wartime. However, to dismiss the inhumanities as an inevitable reality of warfare, or to distract attention away from them by enforcing positive aspects of the military, is to ignore the gravity of the issue. Only recently, under the pressure of heightened public scrutiny, did President Bush exchange his previously lukewarm expressions of regret for a more sincere apology. Yet the damage has been done; no words can redeem the atrocity or compensate for the attitude of negligence his callous words revealed. Looking out for the American troops isn\u2019t enough; it only takes one photograph of the receiving end of the blows to remind us that in warfare there are always two sides to everything.</span></p> <p><span><i>Rena Xu \u201907, a Crimson editorial editor, lives in Holworthy Hall.</i></span></p>"}

All these people have worked to get us here.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Cameras flashed, gay rights activists cheered and a group of Harvard students organized by the Bisexual, Gay, Lesbian, Transgender, and Supporters Alliance (BGLTSA) joined the thousands gathered outside to watch as each couple ascended the steps of City Hall last night.</span></p> <p><span>Some holding flowers, others wiping away tears, couples saluted the crowd and raised their clasped hands in triumph.</span></p> <p><span>The couples who file forms today will need to wait three days before receiving their licenses, unless they obtain a waiver of this waiting period in probate court. According to City Clerk E. Margaret Drury, these waivers are \u201cfairly commonly granted.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Although several members of the Cambridge City Council sought to begin granting marriage licenses immediately after the SJC\u2019s November ruling, the city had to wait until the end of a 180-day court-mandated stay period. But councillors passed an order calling on the city clerk to issue licenses \u201cas soon as legally possible,\u201d which meant opening the offices at midnight on the day the ruling took effect.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThat we are here at this hour shows that you have kept your promise,\u201d Arthur Lipkin of the Cambridge Lavender Alliance told the councillors last night at a ceremony in the packed City Hall chamber, standing next to a clock counting down the minutes until midnight.</span></p> <p><span>Councillor E. Denise Simmons, one of the co-sponsors of the original resolution calling for immediate issuing if licenses, was among those waiting to file for a license early this morning, holding number 89.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMy order has been on the record for six months,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cThis is the realization of it.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Couples filing for marriage face an uncertain future, as the state legislature voted in March in favor of a proposed constitutional amendment banning gay marriage but establishing civil unions. If the amendment passes another legislative session in 2005-2006, it will be put to a statewide referendum.</span></p> <p><span>But the couples and their supporters last night focused on the positive.</span></p> <p><span>State Sen. Jarrett T. Barrios \u201990, a leading advocate of gay rights in the legislature who gave personal testimony against the proposed amendment, said that he and his partner would not be filing the paperwork today but would \u201cwait until the rush dies down.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI just want to be here as part of history,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Lowell House Masters Diana L. Eck and Rev. Dorothy A. Austin joined the couples and their supporters who thronged the three floors of City Hall. The group varied widely in age and ethnicity, with women slightly outnumbering men.</span></p> <p><span>Mayor Michael A. Sullivan opened the ceremony last night by noting that Cambridge had been at the forefront of gay rights before, voting previously to end discrimination based on sexual orientation and to establish one of the first domestic partnership ordinances.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt is fitting that we come to this chamber tonight to celebrate an historical day in this Commonwealth, a day that extends rights and privileges and ends discrimination against gays and lesbians,\u201d he said to applause.</span></p> <p><span>In an invocation, Rev. Irene Monroe compared the beginning of gay marriage to past civil rights milestones such as Brown v. Board of Education and noted that rather than being pronounced husband and wife, couples could now choose to be pronounced spouse and spouse, husband and husband or wife and wife.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cBut my favorite is this\u2014I now pronounce you married,\u201d she said, adding after a standing ovation, \u201cunder the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The ceremony also included songs by several community choirs, including a rendition of the Beatles\u2019 \u201cCan\u2019t Buy Me Love.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Mary Bonauto of the Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders, the lead attorney on behalf of the gay couples in the SJC case, spoke last night to a rousing ovation and chants of \u201cMary, Mary!\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis decision was controversial in the eyes of some, courageous in the eyes of others,\u201d she said of the court\u2019s ruling. \u201cBut I think we will come to see that this decision was undoubtedly correct.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><b>DANCING IN THE STREETS</b></span></p> <p><span>Outside, approximately 150 students joined members of the BGLTSA to show a festive solidarity for the couples awaiting licenses.</span></p> <p><span>The procession began at the statue of John Harvard at 11:45 p.m., when Margaret C.D. Barusch \u201906 addressed a cheering, singing crowd, composed largely of undergraduates and students from Harvard Law School, who then marched to City Hall accompanied by police officers.</span></p> <p><span>Adam P. Schneider \u201907, public relations chair for the BGLTSA, was sick but came anyway dressed in a coat and tie.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cBasically this is the culmination of our campus campaign for gay marriage,\u201d said Schneider, also a Crimson editor. \u201cWe\u2019re just going along to support all the happy couples who are being recognized as equals by not only their peers, but society as a whole.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The crowd of supporters included seven members of the Harvard Republican Club (HRC), with two executive board members among them.</span></p> <p><span>One of the HRC members, Joshua A. Barro \u201905, appealed earlier to the club\u2019s open-list for Republicans to show that the \u201cnext generation of Republicans is tolerant and inclusive\u201d by joining in the march.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s not an official club-sanctioned event, but we are coming to show that there are Republicans who support gay marriage,\u201d said Barro, wearing his blue HRC T-shirt. \u201cI think this is the direction the Republican Party is heading.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Members of the Harvard Christian Fellowship also participated in the procession, though not as an official contingent of the Harvard student group.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe\u2019re coming out as individual Christians to show our support for the gays and lesbians who are getting married tonight,\u201d said Stephen E. Dewey \u201907. \u201cWe are very happy for them.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>A large contingent of residents of Pforzheimer House, some of them clearly inebriated, marched along to show their support.</span></p> <p><span>Across the street from City Hall, several protestors were cordoned off behind a row of Cambridge police officers in full riot gear.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhen the government institutes a sin, it\u2019s the job of God\u2019s people to say something about it,\u201d said Ben Phelps, 28, a Topeka, Kan., resident who had traveled to Cambridge with several members of his church group.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf you spit in God\u2019s face, God hates you and you\u2019re doomed,\u201d said Phelps, who held a sign with the slogan \u201cFags Doom Nations.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><b>FOR WHOM THE WEDDING BELLS TOLL</b></span></p> <p><span>While the events at City Hall did not begin until late last night, nearly a dozen same-sex couples and supporters were camped outside by mid-afternoon, adorning the historic building\u2019s entrance with flowers, beach chairs and decorative swans. National and local media reporters mixed in with the excited couples, at times outnumbering them.</span></p> <p><span>Away from the hoopla, one couple stood in a silent embrace, clutching flowers received from well-wishers.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty unbelievable,\u201d said Sasha Hartman, an accounts manager at a Boston advertising agency. Hartman\u2019s words echoed the dazed mentality of  the couples on hand, many of whom expressed emotions ranging from disbelief to euphoria as the clock ticked closer to the midnight filing time.</span></p> <p><span>Hartman and her partner Alex Fennell were fifth in line for obtaining a license. The two have been together for nine years and live in the South End.</span></p> <p><span>The chance that the legislature will amend the state constitution to ban gay marriage did not dampen the spirits among the soon-to-be-wed couples, though many admitted it weighed on their minds.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe just want to get the formality done because there\u2019s been so many efforts to take this away from us,\u201d said Fennell, who is an attorney. \u201cIt\u2019s there and it\u2019s something you think about. It\u2019s hard to understand why so many people are spending so much energy to take this away.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Others were skeptical of the legislature\u2019s ability to annul the licenses.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhat are they going to do? Are they going to unmarry us?\u201d Sue Hyde said from the second position in line. Hyde is the New England field organizer of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.</span></p> <p><span>Not all onlookers were from the Boston area. Maria Boroff drove with her partner and five-year-old daughter from Philadelphia to witness the historic event.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI never thought it would come,\u201d said Boroff, who wore diamond-shaped glasses and beads around her neck. \u201cI\u2019m not a marriage activist but President Bush turned me into one. He\u2019s trying to take away a right I didn\u2019t have.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>From the front of the line, with the prospect of marriage hanging in front of her, Hams looked back at how far she and society had come.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cNever in a million years, [it] never occurred to us that we would be able to do this,\u201d she said.</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Claire Provost contributed to the reporting of this story.</i></span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Michael M.

{"title": "It's Time for Plan B | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>In a disheartening case of politics trumping science, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently repudiated its own expert advisory panel and rejected over-the-counter sale of the emergency contraceptive Plan B, more commonly known as the \u201cmorning after pill.\u201d We have long supported the over-the-counter sale of Plan B, and we hope that the FDA will reconsider its unfortunate ruling.</span></p> <p><span>This year, the FDA\u2019s expert advisory panel voted 27 to 0 in favor of allowing Plan B to be sold over-the-counter. Despite the overwhelming support for widespread access to emergency contraception, however, the FDA\u2019s handlers claim that the drug has not yet proven safe for younger teenagers. This unexpected decision came right after President Bush received a letter from 49 conservative Congress members pleading that the proposal be rejected\u2014access to emergency contraception without a prescription would undoubtedly increase promiscuity among America\u2019s daughters, conservatives claimed.</span></p> <p><span>Under U.S. law, the FDA is required to approve drugs for sale so long as their safety and efficacy are confirmed. However, in the case of Plan B, it seems that the FDA disregarded protocol in hopes of gratifying conservative interests. In fact, two FDA officials, acting director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research Steven Galson and acting FDA commissioner Lester M. Crawford are being urged to resign for playing politics at the FDA. Some congressmen are also calling for an investigation of the FDA in order to determine whether their dealings were, in fact, politically motivated.</span></p> <p><span>Aside from the questionable sincerity of the FDA\u2019s proceedings, the rejected proposal is a medical tragedy for women across the nation. Emergency contraception is a safe and effective method of reducing a woman\u2019s risk of becoming pregnant with and effectiveness of between 75 to 99 percent. According to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, over-the-counter availability of Plan B would result in 1.7 million fewer unwanted pregnancies and 800,000 fewer abortions each year. Moreover, a recent study published in the Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology has shown that providing sexually active teenage girls with emergency contraception in no way makes them more likely to have unprotected sex\u2014conservative concerns about increased promiscuity were thus proved unfounded and irrelevant. But as long as Plan B is a prescription drug, access is limited\u2014doctors are hard to get a hold of on weekends and during holidays, and biased pharmacists often refuse to sell it.</span></p> <p><span>Whereas 26 other countries including Sri Lanka, Albania and Madagascar have made emergency contraception available without prescription years ago, the U.S. government continues to put politics ahead of women\u2019s health. The FDA should take politics out of science and rescind its decision.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Massachusetts Says 'I Do' | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Last night, the eyes of the world were upon Cambridge, the first city in America to legally grant marriage licenses to same-sex couples. While the struggle is far from over, the time to celebrate this momentous victory has arrived.</span></p> <p><span>The November ruling from the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) upholding same-sex marriage took effect at midnight last night, allowing couples across the state to take their vows.  This historic occasion marks the culmination of a six-month struggle to fend off the political and legal attacks of gay marriage opponents like Gov. Mitt Romney, who have tried to circumvent the SJC\u2019s ruling. On a larger scale, today also represent an enormous step forward for gay marriage advocates across the state and country. It is heartening to see that not even the manipulations and false rationalizations of the governor, or for that matter, President Bush, can suppress the efforts of same-sex couples to gain a right to which they are unquestionably entitled.</span></p> <p><span>Over the course of the following week, several Massachusetts churches and synagogues will be making special efforts to accommodate the unusually large number of weddings called for by same-sex couples eager to enjoy their newly obtained freedom. The Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA) has announced that it is ready to wed any couple wishing to get married\u2014regardless of religious affiliation. Today, the denomination\u2019s president is going to preside over the wedding of Hillary and Julie Goodridge, the couple who led the lawsuit that resulted in the SJC\u2019s ruling. The wedding will take place in the UUA\u2019s headquarters, right across from the Massachusetts State House, where Romney and various lawmakers attempted to deny them their constitutional rights. Another plaintiff couple in the Goodridge case, Gloria Bailey and Linda Davies, is having its wedding aired on ABC\u2019s \u201cNightline.\u201d The open-mindedness and activism of the UUA, as well as that of other religious organizations, such as the Reform and Reconstructionist Jewish movements and a large number of Church of Christ ministers, is to be greatly commended.</span></p> <p><span>The right to marry the person of one\u2019s choosing\u2014regardless of gender\u2014is a fundamental right that all Americans are granted, and we hope that Massachusetts is the first of 50 states to recognize these rights. This day is historic because it marks the triumph of the principle of fairness and right over discrimination and fear.</span></p> <p><span>This past Friday, in a last-ditch attempt to prevent the SJC\u2019s ruling from taking effect, gay marriage opponents requested an emergency order from the United States Supreme Court halting the dissemination of marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Fortunately, hours after the federal appeals court in Boston denied a similar request, the Supreme Court refused to grant the order.  As the fight gets tougher for gay marriage opponents, they continue to cling to deceptive and self-righteous arguments about the sanctity of marriage and the immorality of homosexuality. Yet it remains unclear why the meaning of marriage should change simply because others in committed, loving relationships are also allowed to marry, and why, even if the notion of matrimony is expanded to include two husbands or two wives, that such change must inherently be negative.</span></p> <p><span>As same-sex couples begin to enjoy their newly won equality, opponents insist that \u201cthe battle is not over.\u201d In a time when Roe v. Wade is teetering on the edge of extinction, and important liberties are falling victim to the moral proselytizing of social conservatives, it is important that these vows to carry on the struggle resonate as strongly with advocates of gay marriage as they do with opponents. While today is a day to rejoice, it is also a time to remind ourselves that basic liberties are gained and preserved only at the price of eternal vigilance.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Harvard Grapples With Patriot Act | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Nathan J. Heller", "body": "<p><span>Late last month, University President Lawrence H. Summers sent two letters to Washington. One was addressed to U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell, the other to Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Tom Ridge \u201967. The documents detailed problems that have surfaced at Harvard and across higher education since Sept. 11, 2001.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard\u2019s international enrollment figures are down, Summers wrote. Echoing other leaders of higher education, he suggested that the decline resulted from regulations and restrictions on travel established in the wake of Sept. 11.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think it\u2019s a very serious problem for our students, for the University, and ultimately for the United States, because recruiting the best foreign students here is very important for our prosperity,\u201d Summers wrote. \u201cAnd it is very important in promoting international understanding of the United States and by the United States, when that is in shorter supply than it has been for a very long time.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Summers\u2019 letters to Powell and Ridge add to a growing debate about the necessity and side effects of the Patriot Act and other post-Sept. 11 legislation, a debate that has been going on for the past two years.</span></p> <p><span>While some contend that this legislation is unalterable and entirely necessary, others claim that it is excessively constrictive and even self-defeating.</span></p> <p><span>One thing is clear: At Harvard and across academia, legislation enacted after Sept. 11 have had a major impact on Harvard, affecting primarily the University\u2019s international population and its scientists. Stories to follow will examine the effects of this legislation on these two facets of University life.</span></p> <p><span>At the same time, some fears about the legislation\u2014particularly faculty concern that government agents would make use of a Patriot Act provision allowing them to look into library records without a warrant\u2014have, thus far, not come to fruition, according to University officials.</span></p> <p><span>For the University\u2019s international community, post-Sept. 11 legislation has impelled many of the world\u2019s top scholars to seek education elsewhere. New regulations have introduced new steps into the processes allowing foreign students and scholars to study in the United States. In some cases, the new systems have produced new backlogs\u2014sometimes making a successful arrival in Cambridge an unexpected hurdle after the race for admission.</span></p> <p><span>For scientists, a change in governmental priorities in the name of national security has been a mixed blessing. Fears of bioterrorism have at once brought a tremendous influx of funding and support to Harvard and its peers. At the same time, though, it has imposed new restrictions, which critics like Bloom say compromise the spirit of open exchange on which science is predicated.</span></p> <p><span>While some higher education advocates have suggested exempting universities from some of the Patriot Act\u2019s more extreme demands in order to eliminate delays, those close to the new legislation do not seem to support the possibility for exceptions to the legislation\u2019s scrutiny.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think any restriction would not only be impractical, it would be counter-productive,\u201d says former Assistant Attorney General Viet Dinh, who was primarily responsible for assembling the Act in its final form.</span></p> <p><span>According to those who have tracked concerns most closely over the course of the past year on behalf of the University, a mutually satisfying solution is neither easy nor imminent.</span></p> <p><span>American higher education, it seems, will likely be living with the new regulations for some time.</span></p> <p><span><b>INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS</b></span></p> <p><span>Since Sept. 11, foreign students subject to new scrutiny have found it increasingly harder to acquire the paperwork to be admitted to the U.S. in time for the start of the classes.</span></p> <p><span>Over the past two years, more than a dozen students were not in Cambridge to submit their fall study cards due to visa-processing delays.

Each of Harvard\u2019s nine schools reported similar decreases in international application numbers.</span></p> <p><span>And, according to Director of the International Office Sharon Ladd, this drop coincides with an increase in the number of international applications at universities in England, Canada, and Australia.</span></p> <p><span>The implications of these changes suggest serious problems for a University increasingly attempting to become part of a global community.</span></p> <p><span>Summers\u2019 letters to Powell and Ridge outlined an argument that complicates an already thorny set of issues still further.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf the next generation of foreign leaders are educated elsewhere we also will have lost the incalculable benefits derived from their extended exposure to our country and its democratic values,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd if other countries feel that we do not welcome their citizens, these countries may feel less inclined to help America.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The letter is Summers\u2019 first stand on these concerns before Washington leadership. Some scholars who have been kept outside Harvard\u2019s gates because of visa delays argue that this is not enough\u2014that the University\u2019s leadership should have spoken out louder a long time ago.</span></p> <p><span>Regardless of the outcome of the next election, Harvard\u2019s representatives in Washington say the disquiet post-Sept. 11 legislation raises is still palpable almost three years after the terrorist acts\u2014and isn\u2019t likely to disappear anytime soon.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe concerns that people have continue to percolate,\u201d said Kevin Casey, Harvard\u2019s senior director of federal and state relations. \u201cThe international issues are going to be with us for a long time.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Although Ladd says the process of bringing foreign students into the country this year was much more lucid than it was last year, about 10 students almost didn\u2019t make it to Harvard this fall.</span></p> <p><span>And with a new fingerprinting system, capable of inducing delays, now mandatory only for visa-holders from some nations but scheduled to become universally required this fall, the International Office will have to stay on its toes for some time.</span></p> <p><span><b>SCIENCE</b></span></p> <p><span>With heightened fears of bioterrorism in the wake of Sept. 11, the Bush administration has more than doubled federal funding for programs against terror, with nearly $6 billion allotted to a new program called Project BioShield.</span></p> <p><span>Much of this support has found its way to academia. Harvard, in fact, has seen a sudden burst of facility construction and resources development over the course of the past year, largely as a result of the new federal appropriations.</span></p> <p><span>But increased federal attention to scientific research hasn\u2019t come without costs.</span></p> <p><span>Since Sept. 11 scientists have found their work itself under greater scrutiny\u2014and, in some cases, facing new restrictions. Researchers from nations deemed sponsors of terrorism have been barred from work involving nearly 80 biological pathogens\u2014the very front on which anti-terrorism work is concentrated.</span></p> <p><span>In other cases, previously publishable studies are no longer able to find a place in journals for fear of disseminating information that terrorists could use against the country.</span></p> <p><span>Combined with increasing use in government documents of a \u201csensitive\u201d category of research\u2014an undefined term out of use since the Cold War\u2014these restrictions have impelled some research leaders to discuss a \u201cchilling\u201d effect within the academy.</span></p> <p><span>For scientific research, critics say, the new regulations continue to be a mixed blessing, bringing in valuable funding for important new work while in some cases imposing unwelcome conditions on these projects.</span></p> <p><span>Some of the Patriot Act\u2019s more extreme provisions\u2014such as a section allowing wiretapping without previously required court approval\u2014are scheduled to \u201csunset\u201d next year, and Casey says he presently expects Congress to support the shutdown of some of the Act\u2019s requirements.</span></p> <p><span>Still, he cites a \u201cculture of secrecy\u201d within the Department of Defense, suggesting that the future is vague still.</span></p> <p><span>With resolution still fixed indefinitely in the future, debate rages on among the nation\u2019s top scholars, academic leaders and, in some cases, its legislators. Bills that would scale back some of the Patriot Act\u2019s provisions are presently under debate in the Senate and the House.</span></p> <p><span>While some demand that the new restrictions be scaled back, others suggest that systematic problems with existing post-Sept. 11 legislation are not sufficient reason for governmental regulation to back off entirely.

{"title": "FDR Got It Right... | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Herbie Haupt was the first of six Nazi agents to be electrocuted in the District of Columbia jail on Aug. 8, 1942. He was also an American citizen. Two months earlier, on June 17, Haupt had landed ashore with three compatriots at Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. Their group, along with a second group of four Nazi spies that landed in eastern Long Island on June 13, came from Germany by submarine. They had instructions to destroy American factories, power plants, railroads and other military-industrial sites\u2014an assignment known as Operation Pastorius.</span></p> <p><span>Federal authorities quickly apprehended the eight saboteurs, all of whom were wearing civilian clothing at the time. On July 2, President Franklin D. Roosevelt established a military commission to try them. Six of the eight, including the 22-year-old Haupt, were executed; one was sentenced to life imprisonment; and one was sentenced to thirty years imprisonment.</span></p> <p><span>In a unanimous 8-0 ruling, the Supreme Court upheld Roosevelt\u2019s right to detain the eight men and try them by military commission in the landmark Ex parte Quirin case. The Court explicitly noted the difference between \u201clawful\u201d and \u201cunlawful\u201d combatants: \u201cLawful combatants are subject to capture and detention as prisoners of war by opposing military forces. Unlawful combatants are likewise subject to capture and detention, but in addition they are subject to trial and punishment by military tribunals for acts which render their belligerency unlawful.\u201d The Nazi agents, in the Court\u2019s view, were plainly \u201cunlawful\u201d combatants, as they came secretly \u201cwithout uniform...for the purpose of waging war by destruction of life or property.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The Court also took care to address the issue of Haupt\u2019s American citizenship. \u201cCitizenship in the United States of an enemy belligerent does not relieve him from the consequences of a belligerency which is unlawful because in violation of the law of war. Citizens who associate themselves with the military arm of the enemy...[and] enter this country bent on hostile acts are enemy belligerents\u201d and subject to military jurisdiction.</span></p> <p><span>The Quirin decision should be required reading for those who think the Bush administration has abandoned constitutional precedent by designating captured terrorist Jose Padilla an \u201cenemy combatant\u201d and holding him without trial. Indeed, the administration has relied heavily on Quirin as the basis of its argument in Rumsfeld v. Padilla, a watershed case now before the Supreme Court.</span></p> <p><span>Padilla is better known as the \u201cDirty Bomber,\u201d the American citizen who, according to government officials, received explosives training from al Qaeda operatives in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and later plotted with al Qaeda lieutenant Abu Zubaydah to detonate a radiological bomb in the United States. Padilla was arrested at Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare International Airport in May 2002. Since being classified as an enemy combatant, he has been detained in a South Carolina naval brig.</span></p> <p><span>Last December, New York\u2019s Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled, in a 2-1 decision, that the Quirin precedent did not give Bush the authority to exercise military jurisdiction over U.S. citizens such as Padilla. It ordered that Padilla be released within 30 days or else formally charged in a civilian court, claiming his detention was illegal under Title 18, Section 4001(a) of the U.S. Code. Known as the \u201cNon-Detention Act,\u201d Section 4001(a) states, \u201cNo citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the United States except pursuant to an Act of Congress.\u201d According to the Second Court, Bush lacked such \u201ccongressional authorization,\u201d since Congress never officially declared war after Sept. 11 (as it did against Nazi Germany after Pearl Harbor). Nor did the administration have constitutional authority \u201cto detain as an enemy combatant an American citizen seized on American soil outside a zone of combat.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But consider the joint resolution passed by Congress on Sept. 14, 2001, the template for the war in Afghanistan. It read in part, \u201cthe President is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States.\u201d If that isn\u2019t \u201ccongressional authorization,\u201d what is?</span></p> <p><span>As for the \u201czone of combat\u201d argument? Well, when facing an enemy whose tactics are directed chiefly at civilians far removed from the conventional battlefield, we might say that the entire American homeland is potentially a \u201czone of combat.\u201d Moreover, the Quirin Court made short work of this argument in 1942. It said that American citizens who enter U.S. territory during wartime \u201cin civilian dress and with hostile purpose\u201d are \u201cenemy belligerents,\u201d plain and simple. Whether they are physically captured in the \u201czone of active military operations\u201d matters for naught.</span></p> <p><span>Rumsfeld v. Padilla is closely related to another case currently before the Court: Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, which concerns a U.S. citizen, Yaser Hamdi, captured in Afghanistan fighting with the Taliban. The issue at stake is whether the president can hold him indefinitely as a battlefield detainee. Richmond\u2019s Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has affirmed this right as a constitutional war power.</span></p> <p><span>At root, the premises of Padilla and Hamdi are twofold. First, America is either  justified in responding to al Qaeda and its allies by invoking the laws of war\u2014as opposed to relying on the criminal-justice system\u2014or it isn\u2019t. Second, our enemies\u2019 terrorist methods are either legal under the rules and customs of war, or they aren\u2019t. No amount of pedantic hairsplitting over \u201ccivil rights\u201d and \u201cdue process\u201d is going to work if it ignores those awkward, obvious questions.</span></p> <p><span><i>Duncan M.

{"title": "Cambridge and Harvard Couples Celebrate New Marriages | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Although the rush had died down at Cambridge City Hall after Monday\u2019s exuberant early-morning celebration, same-sex couples continued to exercise their new legal right to marry yesterday, joining the more than 1,000 gay couples who have now wed across the state.</span></p> <p><span>The unions occurred even as opponents renewed their calls for a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage and Gov. W. Mitt Romney, R-Mass., pledged to enforce a law preventing out-of-state couples from obtaining licenses in Massachusetts.</span></p> <p><span>Shortly before closing time yesterday, the Cambridge City Clerk\u2019s office had received 282 applications for marriage licenses since the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) ruling allowing same-sex marriage took effect on Monday, the vast majority of these coming from same-sex couples.</span></p> <p><span>Twenty-four same-sex couples had obtained court waivers of the three-day waiting period in order to be married immediately, according to Deputy City Clerk Donna Lopez.</span></p> <p><span>The clerk\u2019s office gave out 227 of the license applications between midnight and 4:30 a.m. on Monday, when City Hall opened to allow same-sex couples to file for marriage at the earliest possible moment.</span></p> <p><span>Forty-three couples returned later in the day on Monday to register their intentions to marry, and the city clerk performed 23 same-sex marriages\u2014the first, Marcia Kadish and Tanya McCloskey of Malden, at 9:15 a.m.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t even move at one point in here,\u201d said staff member Marybeth Cosgrove, describing the scene in the clerk\u2019s office, which processed only 12 license applications on May 14, before same-sex marriage became legal.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThey\u2019ve been happy, excited, shaking,\u201d she said of the couples.</span></p> <p><span>Ripped confetti, deflated balloons and candy wrappers scattered across the City Hall lawn were the only remnants yesterday of the party that took place into the early morning hours on Monday, when the city commemorated the occasion with a wedding cake, music and speeches, and thousands gathered outside to cheer for the couples.</span></p> <p><span>But inside, pink and white ribbons still decorated the banisters, and bouquets of flowers rested on a table in the city clerk\u2019s office, donated by Central Square Florist and addressed to \u201cAny Body. City Hall. Cambridge, MA.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>As couples in Cambridge and across the state seek licenses, the possibility remains that same-sex marriages will no longer be legal in two years if a proposed state constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage succeeds.</span></p> <p><span>In March, the Massachusetts State Legislature gave its first approval to the amendment, which would define marriage as between one man and one woman but would establish civil unions for same-sex couples. The legislature must pass the amendment again in the 2005-2006 session before it is put to a statewide referendum.</span></p> <p><span>At the celebration at City Hall Sunday night, shortly before the first couples were allowed to file for marriage licenses, State Rep. Alice K. Wolf, D-Cambridge, a vocal opponent of the proposed amendment, told reporters she was optimistic that it would not pass.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere\u2019s a good shot at having it voted down next year,\u201d said Wolf, who will serve as a witness at a same-sex marriage later this week.</span></p> <p><span>A challenge to same-sex marriage could also come at the national level. President George W. Bush has voiced support for a federal constitutional amendment limiting marriage to heterosexual couples.</span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile, Romney, who opposes gay marriage, yesterday ordered four cities to submit copies of same-sex marriage license applications that may have come from out-of-state couples.</span></p> <p><span>Romney previously instructed city clerks to enforce a 1913 state law prohibiting non-residents from receiving marriage licenses in Massachusetts if the marriage would not be legal in their home state.</span></p> <p><span>The records request was directed at four cities that openly pledged to defy Romney\u2019s order\u2014Worcester, Springfield, Somerville and Provincetown.</span></p> <p><span>Cambridge City Clerk D. Margaret Drury said last week that she had \u201ca lot of sympathy for [the] position\u201d of those cities but was bound to follow the state registrar\u2019s orders to prohibit out-of-state couples from marrying\u2014although the city would not require proof of residency.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe\u2019re going to do things the way we always have. We accept the sworn oath of the couples as to the truth of the facts that they put in their application,\u201d Drury said last week. \u201cIf couples state under oath that they live in another state and that they intend to return to that state after the marriage, we will not be issuing licenses.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The validity of out-of-state couples\u2019 marriages remained unclear yesterday as the attorneys general of two neighboring states indicated that Massachusetts licenses might be honored there.</span></p> <p><span>Rhode Island Attorney General Patrick C. Lynch said in an advisory opinion that the state would recognize any marriages legally performed in other states, although he said the courts would ultimately decide whether same-sex marriages would be considered valid.</span></p> <p><span>Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said that same-sex marriages were not legal in his state, but that marriages performed in other states would not necessarily be considered invalid.</span></p> <p><span><b>CAMPUS REACTION</b></span></p> <p><span>As the political wrangling continued, members of Harvard\u2019s Bisexual, Gay, Lesbian, Transgender, and Supporters Alliance (BGLTSA) who traveled to City Hall early Monday morning expressed confidence that same-sex marriage will become increasingly palatable to those who currently oppose it.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cOnce people start seeing that all these people are getting married and the sky is not falling, I think it will become a non-issue,\u201d Margaret C.D. Barusch \u201906 said yesterday, adding that the energy of the rally overshadowed the possibility that the SJC\u2019s ruling could be circumvented. \u201cThe way that evening was, people were just so excited, it didn\u2019t really matter what came next.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But Jordan B. Woods \u201906 said that during the celebration, the possible constitutional ban was on his mind as a reason to stay active.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt makes you think that no matter how far we\u2019ve come, obviously we still have to keep on fighting,\u201d he said yesterday.</span></p> <p><span>In addition to the contingent from the BGLTSA, about 20 members of the Harvard College Democrats gathered on the City Hall lawn Sunday.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cYou really felt like you were at a groundbreaking historical event,\u201d said Eric P. Lesser \u201907, who is a member of the organization. \u201cIt was overwhelming.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The College Dems support full marriage rights for same-sex couples, despite the fact that presidential candidate Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., only supports civil unions.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think it\u2019s a generational issue in a lot of ways,\u201d said Dems Legislative Director Thomas M. McSorley \u201906. Last March, McSorley produced a video for the Dems promoting same-sex marriage, comparing the issue to the civil rights movement of the 1960s.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cOur generation is much more pro-gay marriage. I mean, there were a lot of Republicans out at the celebration on Sunday,\u201d McSorley said. \u201cThe bottom line is that John Kerry is Catholic and a member of a much older generation....I really do believe this issue will change as our generation grows older.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>While the Harvard Republican Club (HRC) has not taken a specific position on same-sex marriage, spokesperson Lauren K. Truesdell \u201906 said that per club policy, the HRC \u201cstands with the president\u201d on the issue.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe club supports President Bush\u2019s call for a constitutional ban on gay marriage,\u201d Truesdell said.</span></p> <p><span>Truesdell acknowledged that some HRC members may support same-sex marriage, but none have left the club over the issue.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIn any policy issue you\u2019re always going to have some people who disagree. We found that the most effective way to deal with questions of this type is to go along with the platform of the national party,\u201d she said.</span></p> <p><span>HRC member Joshua A. Barro \u201905, who encouraged other campus Republicans to join the procession to City Hall in support of same-sex marriage, noted yesterday that two of HRC\u2019s seven executive members joined him.</span></p> <p><span>Barro acknowledged that there was disagreement over the issue within HRC, but added, \u201cI\u2019m not aware of any discord in particular. There hasn\u2019t been a really active discussion about it within the club.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Barro said that while he believes prohibiting same-sex marriage is discrimination against homosexuals, he did not think this reflected the views of the HRC.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe club does very few things to officially stamp its approval on the issue,\u201d Barro said. \u201cThere are lots of things in the party platform that people don\u2019t necessarily agree with and the people in the club never discuss.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>A Crimson poll conducted in December found that 77 percent of Harvard students supported the SJC\u2019s ruling in favor of same-sex marriage, and many students yesterday echoed that support.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think it was cool. We were making history, I wanted to be a part of that,\u201d Katherine E. Rieser \u201907, who attended the City Hall rally, said over dinner in Adams House courtyard.</span></p> <p><span>Sasha R. Harris-Lovett \u201907, who also attended, agreed.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think it\u2019s important to support equality in our society...for people who otherwise might not be supported by everybody,\u201d she said.</span></p> <p><span>One student said he thought even more people would have attended the rally Sunday night if the timing had been better.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMost people were studying for exams,\u201d Samuel M.

A week ago, too, after months of concealing the full story, the Pentagon showed Congress over 1,600 additional photographs of atrocities at Abu Ghraib. It is becoming clear that this developing scandal is not a matter of a few \u201cbad apples,\u201d but rather the fault of this entire executive branch. For these horrific acts and the cover-up that followed, we echo the call of others and ask Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld to resign.</span></p> <p><span>The prisoner abuse, in addition to its intrinsic evil, has further tarnished the image of America worldwide, particularly in the Middle East. Already, pundits across the world are comparing Abu Ghraib to My Lai, the infamous massacre of Vietnamese civilians by U.S. forces in 1968. This damage may become irreparable unless decisive action is taken immediately. The nation must dissociate itself from those who allowed the torture and death of detainees to take place under their watch, and Americans must prove that they are serious when they say that such practices are not \u201cthe true face of America.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>American troops and civilians have been directly endangered by the growing furor over the abuse. Abu Ghraib, long a symbol of repression for Iraqis, has now provided further fuel for the resistance\u2019s fire in Iraq. Reprisals are already being carried out: The horrific decapitation of U.S. civilian contractor Nicolas Berg may be a warning sign of what is to come.</span></p> <p><span>What\u2019s more, the Bush administration\u2019s rhetoric on fighting for democracy in Iraq is increasingly hollow. As Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., put it, \u201cWe\u2019re trying to win the hearts and minds as we\u2019re killing them and torturing them.\u201d If we want to assist in the growth of democracy and openness, then our own government needs to be democratic and open itself.</span></p> <p><span>And this administration needs to learn that democracy doesn\u2019t mix with a policy of secrecy. Secretary Rumsfeld withheld information from Congress and the American public and attempted to obstruct CBS from releasing the evidence in the first place. If Rumsfeld had his way, would the atrocities have ever come to light? Would those responsible ever be brought to justice? The whole world is now asking what else might be going on behind the gates of American detention centers.</span></p> <p><span>Pfc. Lyndie England, the most prominent face of the abuse scandal, claims, \u201cI was instructed by persons in higher rank to \u2018stand there, hold this leash, look at the camera.\u2019\u201d Maj. Gen. Antonio Taquba, who led the initial investigation into the abuses, has spoken of an overall \u201cfailure of leadership.\u201d In the military, the chain of command goes all the way to the top. A scandal of this magnitude leads to the secretary of defense, and ultimately to the commander-in-chief as well.</span></p> <p><span>Secretary Rumsfeld and President Bush must therefore accept part of the responsibility for what transpired at Abu Ghraib and for the Pentagon\u2019s efforts to hide it from public view.

Bloom has been among the most outspoken of this latter camp, arguing that effective protection from bioterrorism can only originate from open communication among scientists.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe greatest threat is putting restrictions on knowledge that you need for security,\u201d he says. \u201cFundamentally, censorship of science is the antithesis of its objective.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>It is into this setting that University leadership has been thrown, as Harvard has been faced with an array of often unprecedented questions, forcing administrators to determine exactly where the boundaries of openness and academic freedom lie.</span></p> <p><span>Their new challenge is to find a way to use innovation to protect the nation without sabotaging the values of science itself.</span></p> <p><span><b>A CHANGED TERRAIN</b></span></p> <p><span>The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the series of anthrax attacks that followed reorganized governmental priorities.</span></p> <p><span>The zeitgeist shifted toward national defense, and a mandate from Washington apportioned a large slice of the national budget toward protecting the country from terrorism\u2014a new type of national threat.</span></p> <p><span>In pursuing projects geared toward this end, the government turned largely to institutions working at the vanguard of research, and in a large way to universities like Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>In January of last year, Bush unveiled Project BioShield, a $6 billion budgetary allotment to fund research on biological defense.</span></p> <p><span>The program has helped to bring about a burst of new opportunities for Harvard and its peers.</span></p> <p><span>At the beginning of this academic year Harvard Medical School received $45 million from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to build a new biodefense research center. The facility will initially house nine research projects working to develop vaccines and treatments for anthrax, SARS, botulism, West Nile virus, and other of the world\u2019s most dangerous pathogens.</span></p> <p><span>One week later, the University garnered another $15 million to support a Center of Excellence in Complex Biomedical Systems research at the Bauer Center for Genomics Research.</span></p> <p><span>And in January, SPH received a $20.5 million biodefense grant\u2014the largest in its history\u2014for a study of immune response to pathogens. The study\u2019s results, when ready, will suggest how the human immune system can best be fortified against biological agents, many of which could be used for bioterrorism.</span></p> <p><span>According to Senior Director of Federal and State Relations Kevin Casey, there\u2019s been a significant rise in funding in the wake of Sept. 11.</span></p> <p><span>In the year before the terrorist attacks, Harvard received $348 million of federal funding. Last year, by contrast, research projects at the University brought in a total of $412 million. Casey points out however, that other factors, such as a planned increase in the grant budget of the NIH, likely helped drive these gains.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard is also reaping the benefits of increased funding through partnership with other local institutions. Over the course of the past two years, federal funds have spawned a wave of growth throughout greater Boston.</span></p> <p><span>Last fall, funding cleared for the first and only top-security biological laboratory in New England\u2014bringing the vanguard of biological research to Boston with it.</span></p> <p><span>The so-called BioSecurity Level 4 lab (BSL-4) is the crown jewel of biological research facilities, comprised of an array of sealed chambers and locked freezers intended less to keep intruders out than to keep test subjects in.</span></p> <p><span>The new facility will be used as a refining ground for previous research, providing a secure environment in which researchers can test their research on whole pathogens.</span></p> <p><span>When the South End facility, technically under the auspices of Boston University, opens in 2006, it will enable scientists from several local institutions\u2014including Harvard\u2014to carry out research on everything from AIDS vaccines to the Plague.</span></p> <p><span><b>THE FLIP SIDE OF FUNDING</b></span></p> <p><span>Not everyone is convinced, though, that the wave of new funding is bringing the benefits it promises.</span></p> <p><span>Kendall Hoyt, a fellow in the International Security Program at the Kennedy School of Government, has been tracking the effects of increased funding for science since Sept. 11.</span></p> <p><span>She says her research indicates that the new rivers of federal money flowing into higher education may actually be working to sink the national-security boat\u2014in part because the NIH, through which most funds are funneled, lacks a system for ensuring that projects are relevant, unique, and ultimately worthwhile.</span></p> <p><span>Mismanagement of projects has already led to a huge waste of resources made worse by flawed threat assessment, she says.</span></p> <p><span>But she cites another danger that has aroused controversy at Harvard and its peers.</span></p> <p><span>More work on biological pathogens means more potentially subversive knowledge about them, Hoyt says.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAs you expand these programs, you\u2019re training more and more people to deal with these pathogens,\u201d she says. Some could eventually use the findings for harm rather than help.</span></p> <p><span>This possibility is the government\u2019s worst fear\u2014and one that has motivated a series of new restrictions on scientific research since Sept. 11.</span></p> <p><span><b>NEW OBSTACLES</b></span></p> <p><span>The wave of anthrax strikes that followed Sept. 11 brought concerns about biological terrorism to the fore, and the government responded by attempting to seal off the information channels through which biological information could be turned against the nation.</span></p> <p><span>In the wake of the attacks, biological science has accumulated more red tape than it has faced since the Cold War.</span></p> <p><span>Some new restrictions affect who can conduct research. Others limit the dissemination of research findings themselves. And President Bush has authorized federal officials to craft these regulations based on what many feel is a vague new research category and a blank check for further restriction.</span></p> <p><span>Many of the restrictions are based on a current list of almost 80 biological pathogens called \u201cselect agents.\u201d Before Sept. 11, this list was about 10 times smaller.</span></p> <p><span>At present, SPH is the only school at Harvard to perform research involving select agents\u2014and even then, according to Bloom, very sparingly. Most research, he explains, is undertaken only on pathogens\u2019 components, rather than the substances in their dangerous forms.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere\u2019s an enormous amount of science that does not involve the actual substance, whole in a freezer in the lab,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>Section 817 of the USA PATRIOT Act, the broad-ranging anti-terrorist legislation passed in October of 2001, bars \u201crestricted persons\u201d\u2014researchers who either have criminal backgrounds or who come from countries that the U.S. has identified as state sponsors of terrorism\u2014from any access to select agents.</span></p> <p><span>And many potential researchers from foreign countries have trouble even making it into the U.S. to start with.</span></p> <p><span>The Technology Alert List, which predated Sept. 11 but was expanded in its wake, is a compilation of fields that the government fears could be applied toward subversive activity. Flagged pursuits range from biological research to landscape architecture, but Washington addresses them uniformly.</span></p> <p><span>If a foreign researcher\u2019s interests match those on the list, his or her visa is subject to extra scrutiny\u2014a process that accounts for considerable backlog and, in some cases, prevents scientists from meeting their research objectives in the U.S.</span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile, legislation following the terrorist attacks changed research standards themselves.</span></p> <p><span>An executive order on homeland security that President Bush issued in 2002 authorized government officials to bar \u201ccertain international students\u201d from education and training in \u201csensitive areas.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>It\u2019s unclear what \u201csensitive\u201d research\u2014a formal Cold-War category just short of classified that was abandoned in the 1960s\u2014means today.</span></p> <p><span>National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice says the \u201csensitive\u201d category has not been formally revived.</span></p> <p><span>According to Casey, though, those on the ground aren\u2019t convinced.</span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile, other pressures have begun to inhibit the dissemination of information itself.</span></p> <p><span>In response to urging from U.S Attorney General John Ashcroft, thirty-two of the nation\u2019s leading scientific journals\u2014the primary forum for the exchange of vanguard research\u2014announced last year their intention to self-censor, pledging to nix publications that could lead to a terrorist attack.</span></p> <p><span>In addition to these broad directives and prohibitions, restrictions can rear their head on the more localized level, in the form of conditions placed on an individual federal grant.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard automatically rejects contracts that place any conditions on researchers\u2019 freedom to use their findings\u2014such as their ability to publish results.</span></p> <p><span>Last year, MIT refused a $400,000 grant from the National Security Agency because it would have required disclosure of information about international researchers contributing to an unclassified study.</span></p> <p><span><b>CONCERNS AND OPPOSITION</b></span></p> <p><span>A cadre of researchers at Harvard and its peers says the new regulations create a culture clash, closing science\u2019s vital channels of openness in both directions: talented researchers are no longer able to contribute, and important information can no longer be shared for further progress.</span></p> <p><span>A conference last year at the Kennedy School of Government\u2019s John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum brought many of these concerns to the public eye. There, Bloom, the SPH dean, joined MIT President Charles M. Vest and Former Secretary of the Air Force Sheila Widnall to argue that opportunities for the free exchange of knowledge must remain available, even in the wake of Sept. 11.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI believe that restriction is rarely advisable, and certainly rarely feasible, in this environment,\u201d Vest said. \u201cRestrictions on our teaching and where our students come from are unlikely to counter [national security] concerns.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Bloom alleged that the set of post-Sept. 11 restrictions undermines the basic pedagogical goals of a research university.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s creating ignorance among the greatest universities and the brightest students,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>At Harvard, restrictions on who can work with select agents mean that SPH scientists from a few blackballed nations, mainly Middle-Eastern countries, aren\u2019t able to pursue work with the most dangerous biological pathogens.</span></p> <p><span>According to Bloom, the restrictions haven\u2019t sunk any projects so far, but the University isn\u2019t yet out of the woods. The rigorous background scrutinies now required by the government could dissuade some scientists from taking on major projects, he explains.</span></p> <p><span>Casey has been trying to make sure that background checks take place as expediently as possible, so that prospective researchers aren\u2019t prevented from meeting academic deadlines.</span></p> <p><span>In the realm of publication restrictions, Casey is working with peer universities to document and devise a unified strategy against conditional contracts.</span></p> <p><span>According to critics like Bloom, both restrictive contracts and self-censorship could have devastating effects on the exchange of information, ultimately paralyzing, rather than protecting, the biological advances that might be used to protect the country.</span></p> <p><span>The sort of material that ordinarily appears in peer journals, he says, is so specific and esoteric that a terrorist would have difficulty in appropriating it in any case.</span></p> <p><span>The ambiguous reinvocation of a \u201csensitive\u201d research category has drawn particular ire from scientists.</span></p> <p><span>Vest, who last spring organized a special conference at MIT after his panel discussion at the Forum, said he thought an undefined \u201csensitive\u201d category could lead to a \u201cslippery slope\u201d in restriction.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhenever possible, we should draw distinct boundaries,\u201d he said. \u201cBasic research should be open, and [applied] research should be either classified or unclassified.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Bloom takes issue with the implications of the presidential directive more broadly.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s creating ignorance among the greatest universities and the brightest students,\u201d he said of efforts to red-flag international students and keep them from research opportunities. \u201cWe have to create a culture of science where no one wants to misuse it.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But a year later, he says the path toward achieving this culture is still undefined.</span></p> <p><span><b>DIALOGUE WITH WASHINGTON</b></span></p> <p><span>In the months since Sept. 11, mounting concerns about the new regulations have initiated a dialogue between academia and government.</span></p> <p><span>Governmental leaders say they now recognize the difficulty in tracing a path between the imperatives of national security and the academy\u2019s cherished openness.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d says Elizabeth George, portfolio manager for BioDefense technologies in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which culls available research resources in the interest of national security. She says the DHS has asked leaders in academia to help arrive at a better balance between national security and academic openness, but without a definite outcome. \u201cWe\u2019ve reached out to the experts and the jury is still out.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>John H. Marburger III, who heads the White House\u2019s Office of Science and Technology, has been at the center of these efforts.</span></p> <p><span>He says his interaction with the academic community has ensured that the Bush administration is mindful of tensions and obstacles that governmental oversight might create for research institutions accustomed to being beholden only to their own research concerns.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis administration is quite serious about preserving openness,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>Still, the government has taken few concrete steps over the course of the past year.</span></p> <p><span>Marburger cites as a major step forward a National Academy of Sciences panel chaired by MIT scientist Gerald Fink that recommended steps to give scientists a greater voice in achieving a post-Sept. 11 balance.</span></p> <p><span>The so-called Fink Report upheld the need for research oversight with an eye to national security. But it proposed establishing a committee of experts to ensure that researchers\u2019 projects are reviewed by peer scientists\u2014rather than lay lawmakers\u2014before being impeded or allowed to progress.</span></p> <p><span>Last month, the government implemented this recommendation by establishing the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity, a panel of 25 experts that will provide oversight for institutional projects under governmental aegis.</span></p> <p><span><b>BACK AT HOME</b></span></p> <p><span>While scientists were mulling over universities\u2019 concerns in Washington, a committee comprised of some of Harvard\u2019s top scientific administrators plotted the University\u2019s path through the government\u2019s demands back in Cambridge.</span></p> <p><span>Composed of specialists from all of Harvard\u2019s schools pursuing biological research, the Provost\u2019s Committee on Biodefense Research and Regulations stated emphatically that, while new regulations posed a potential threat to the University\u2019s values, the long-term benefits of research made plodding through the regulations worthwhile.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cFederal laws and regulations, aimed at increasing safety and security...are at odds with certain long-standing University values such as openness and the equality of treatment,\u201d the report said.</span></p> <p><span>Still, research covered by the regulations \u201ccould contribute significantly to the protection of the public\u2019s health.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The report, formally presented to Harvard\u2019s Faculty Council in February, suggested that the faculty of each of Harvard\u2019s schools weigh the costs and benefits of participating in research covered by the new regulations. It also refreshed Harvard\u2019s preexisting policy of not accepting grants imposing conditions on research participation.</span></p> <p><span>But the provost\u2019s committee did recommended that graduate students be held off projects that could be subject to last-minute, career-impeding publication restrictions.</span></p> <p><span>Leaders of Harvard\u2019s schools say that little has come of the report\u2019s recommendations so far.</span></p> <p><span>According to Bloom, the committee should have used its pulpit to make a stronger statement against the post-Sept. 11 regulations on biological research.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think the report missed an opportunity to emphasize the centrality of access to knowledge within the university,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>Tosteson University Professor S. James Adelstein, who chaired the committee, says he thinks Bloom was expecting too much of the document.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe\u2019re writing for the provost, we\u2019re not writing for a bully pulpit,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s an understated Harvard document.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But Bloom suggests that Harvard should have been willing to err on the side of overstatement. He explains he thinks academia in general\u2014as well as Harvard as an institution\u2014has not been vocal enough in its consideration of questions that have risen in the wake of the government\u2019s new demands on research.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI have heard a fairly deafening silence, at least at my end of the river,\u201d he says. He says he understands that a single institution\u2014even one as influential as Harvard\u2014carries little clout on its own.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI\u2019m acutely aware of the limitations of one faculty or one institution,\u201d he says. \u201cThe PATRIOT Act and the Bioterrorism Act are laws of the United States, and as a dean rather than as an individual, I have to comply with the law,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>Even so, Bloom says the response from the higher-education community as a whole could be stronger. \u201cI would like to see a greater thrust of all the universities to modify the PATRIOT Act.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>According to Bloom, governmental regulations on research are unnecessary because social and professional constraints built into the research process\u2014pieces of what he calls \u201ca social compact for designing knowledge and receiving knowledge\u201d\u2014are already more effective in preventing subversive use of information than any federal oversight could hope to be.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe public knows what our higher calling and responsibilities are, and it\u2019s the social constraints, to me, that are the most powerful,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>These constraints\u2014and the education that sustains them\u2014are nowhere more powerful than in a thriving research university, he adds.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cEveryone who goes to Harvard and goes into science understands what scientific integrity is about,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>But not everyone thinks the implications of science in a post-Sept. 11 environment are so straightforward.</span></p> <p><span>James T. Kvach, chief scientist in the Defense Intelligence Agency of the Armed Forces Medical Intelligence Center, says that, while the country is unified in its effort to achieve as much security as possible, agreeing upon a standard of success\u2014and a route toward achieving it\u2014has no easy answer.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt comes down to, as a society, how much risk we\u2019re willing to accept. How much risk am I capable of managing?\u201d he says. \u201cIn my mind, what should be made available is as much as possible, [but] I don\u2019t know where that line is.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff writer Nathan J.

Whether it is lying about the war on terror, damaging America\u2019s image around the world or saddling young people with mountains of debt, this administration has given almost everybody a reason to be angry. But anger is not enough. To beat President Bush progressive groups must work together. Fortunately, Harvard student groups are beginning to show the kind of unity we need. Last week\u2019s Beat Bush rally at the Science Center, which brought out more than 150 students from a wide variety of campus groups and left-leaning political persuasions, was the beginning of what we hope will be a continuing trend towards cooperation between the various progressive groups on campus. Organized by groups ranging from the Harvard College Democrats to the Harvard Initiative for Peace and Justice to the Harvard Socialist Alternative, the rally demonstrated what must be done\u2014on a much larger scale\u2014to win back the White House.</span></p> <p><span>The speakers at the rally focused on different issues, but they all had a common theme. The Bush Administration hasn\u2019t just been bad for young people, who will have to pay off the president\u2019s huge federal deficits. It hasn\u2019t just been bad for women, who have faced restrictions on their right to have abortions. It hasn\u2019t just been bad for working people, who have lost jobs and seen their wages fall. Four more years of George W. Bush would be a monumental setback to the ideals of every progressive group on campus, and the groups who participated in last week\u2019s rally should be applauded for their willingness to put their differences aside.</span></p> <p><span>The 2004 election will be close, and unity can make all the difference. In 2000, Al Gore \u201969 lost New Hampshire by 7,211 votes. Those four electoral votes would have made Gore president. During that election, progressives wasted far too much time and effort fighting among themselves. If Massachusetts progressives had stopped beating each other up and taken a few more campaign trips up to New Hampshire, America might have been spared four years of Bush.</span></p> <p><span>Last week\u2019s rally was a good start, but much remains to be done. We hope progressive student groups will continue to recognize what is in their common interest. The stakes are too high, and the margin of error too small, to waste time squabbling. The Harvard College Democrats are organizing trips to New Hampshire for the fall. Those who want to turn this country around should set aside their differences and get on the bus.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Moore's Mouse Problem | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>This week the Walt Disney Company reaffirmed its intention to block Disney-owned Miramax from distributing Michael Moore\u2019s latest documentary, <i>Fahrenheit 911</i>, through Disney\u2019s distribution channels. The film takes issue with President Bush\u2019s decisions before and after the 2001 World Trade Center attacks and examines Bush\u2019s ties to powerful Saudis, including the Bin Laden family. Disney, as a result, has argued that Moore\u2019s film is too political and partisan for its company to distribute\u2014defying its contract with Miramax. Even more disturbing than Disney\u2019s disavowal of any and all products deemed too political, Moore\u2019s agent has told The New York Times that Disney\u2019s chief executive Michael D. Eisner made clear to him the decision was largely motivated by tax incentives concerning its theme park in the state of Florida.</span></p> <p><span>While Eisner denies the allegation that his company indulges Gov. Jeb Bush in exchange for money, the key issue remains. Disney has a right to distribute what it wants to distribute, but we also reserve the right to criticize malicious decisions. Disney\u2019s choice to use its powerful financial position to keep political expression from the public is an insult to all Americans. If Disney is willing to allow Miramax to make the movies it wants to make, Disney ought to be willing to follow through with its own contract to distribute those films.</span></p> <p><span>To be sure, Moore and Miramax will find a new distributor; of that there is no question. What is particularly worrisome is that the interference of powerful media conglomerates in the dissemination of politically sensitive material has lately become routine. Two weeks ago, Sinclair Broadcast Group instructed its seven ABC affiliates not to air a Nightline segment displaying the names of over 500 U.S. soldiers killed in action in Iraq because, according to Sinclair\u2019s statement, the company deemed the program politically motivated against U.S. efforts in that country. (Meanwhile, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., blasted Sinclair\u2019s decision as \u201ca gross disservice to the public, and to the men and women of the United States Armed Forces.\u201d) In February, Clear Channel Communications, Inc. dropped Viacom\u2019s Howard Stern Show from its programming as part of its new Responsible Broadcasting Initiative (RBI), purportedly because the show was offensive and indecent. But the truth is that the show had been vulgar for many years, and the RBI came days after Stern first voiced his discontent with President Bush.</span></p> <p><span>Together, the Nightline, Stern and <i>Fahrenheit 911</i> episdes form a worrisome pattern of corporate hindrance of political discourse\u2014or in Nightline\u2019s case, simply a refusal to acknowledge the sacrifice of American soldiers. The conglomerates act lawfully. But regardless, by refusing to disseminate programs and publications because of their political content, firms like Sinclair, Clear Channel and Disney perfidiously shape debate to suit their preferences\u2014a complacent public interested in consuming products instead of politics.</span></p> <p><span>Some media outlets feel no compunction in using their influence to stifle points of view for political reasons. To the rest of us, the thought is utterly revolting.</span></p>"}
{"title": "America's Other Intelligence Failure | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>President Bush, talking at last week\u2019s press conference: \u201cYou know, I hope I\u2014I don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019ve made no mistakes; I\u2019m confident I have. I just haven\u2019t\u2014(chuckles)\u2014you just put me under the spot here, and maybe I\u2019m not quick\u2014as quick on my feet as I should be in coming up with one.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>We\u2019d be happy to help you, Mr. President.</span></p> <p><span>Before President Bush was elected, Americans could laugh at his verbal foibles and frat boy insincerity. Saturday Night Live (SNL), late-night talk shows and political commentators lampooned the would-be President incessantly. Underlying these parodies, however, was the belief that what President Bush lacked in clarity of speech, he made up for in moral clarity and an old-fashioned sense of responsibility.</span></p> <p><span>In the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, Americans saw the President give simple, moving speeches. His cockiness was replaced with a sense of mission and an urge to shore up America\u2019s defenses against a potent new threat. He told Americans that we had \u201cnew responsibilities\u201d in a world altered by terrorism.</span></p> <p><span>But he has shirked his.</span></p> <p><span>At a press conference chock-full of furrowed brows, misquoted facts and insincere serpentine smiles, President Bush tried hard to deflect blame for everything from the Sept. 11 attacks to Iraq\u2019s missing WMDs. This press conference, only the third of his presdency, showed Americans a chief executive trying desperately to do damage control. But unanswered questions about WMDs and shifting justifications for the Iraq war, as well as the President\u2019s general evasiveness, undercut the moral clarity and responsibility of a man Americans once chuckled at good-naturedly. By refusing to accept the slightest blame, or answer the most straightforward questions about his actions, President Bush has become a parody of himself.</span></p> <p><span>Maybe he thought voters would still believe that Iraq is rife with WMDs just waiting to be found. As he said in the press conference, \u201cSee, I happen to believe that we\u2019ll find out the truth on the weapons\u2026They could be hidden like the 50 tons of mustard gas in a turkey farm [in Libya].\u201d Of course, as a sheepish White House Spokesman Scott McClellan revealed later, there were actually 23.6 tons of mustard gas, and they were not buried in a turkey farm. Former top U.S. weapons inspector David Kay, once a vehement believer that Iraq had WMDs, has admitted that he and most of the rest of the international community was wrong. According to Kay, even France and Germany, the war\u2019s most vigorous detractors, believed Iraq had WMDs. Everyone\u2019s intelligence estimates were off. Yet President Bush refuses to admit he was wrong, even though there would be few, if any, negative consequences.</span></p> <p><span>Maybe he thought Americans wouldn\u2019t notice his subtle changes in word choice to describe our goals in Iraq. Where our troops used to be dying to promote \u201cdemocracy\u201d in Iraq, at the press conference Bush mentioned only \u201cfreedom.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Maybe he thought the public wouldn\u2019t notice his evasive answers. When asked why he was appearing together with Vice President Dick Cheney before the 9/11 Commission to answer questions about the preventability of the September 11 attacks, Bush first said: \u201cBecause the 9/11 Commission wants to ask us questions, that\u2019s why we\u2019re meeting.\u201d Perhaps thinking that Bush was repeating the question to help the studio audience follow along, the reporter clarified that he wanted to know why they were appearing together. Bush then furthered his previous response: \u201cBecause it\u2019s a good chance for both of us to answer questions that the 9/11 Commission is looking forward to asking us.\u201d Presumably many people watching at home had to check to confirm that they were, in fact, watching a presidential press conference and not an SNL parody.</span></p> <p><span>Maybe he thought that voters shared his belief that the U.S. has a divinely inspired mission in Iraq. As the President said: \u201cFreedom is the Almighty\u2019s gift to every man and woman in this world. And as the greatest power on the face of the Earth, we have an obligation to help the spread of freedom.\u201d President Bush must not recognize how incredibly dangerous his Administration\u2019s sense of religious entitlement is. Not only does framing America\u2019s wars as Christian missions threaten to alienate what few Muslim allies we have left, it also makes our more secular allies uncomfortable. After all, Europe\u2019s last religious war ended in 1648. To promote freedom, America first must embrace all free nations with rhetoric that everyone can agree on\u2014rhetoric that doesn\u2019t include God.</span></p> <p><span>President Bush may be the leader of the free world, but true leaders admit mistakes, answer pointed questions and make an effort to be diplomatic. Bush\u2019s performance at last week\u2019s press conference showed that this president is willing to pass the buck to anyone, even God. If America truly wants to remain the leading power in the fight for freedom world-wide, it could start by demanding a responsible Chief Executive.</span></p>"}
{"title": "A Long, Tough Slog | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>In spite of its numerous failures, the United States\u2019 Iraq endeavor has recently produced a notable\u2014albeit unexpected\u2014union of traditionally opposed Shi\u2019a and Sunni Muslims. Instead of being treated as liberators, American troops have become the common enemy for everyone in Iraq except for the reliably pro-U.S. Kurds in the North. The country\u2019s main sects have come together in shared hatred for the U.S. occupation. Indeed, in the face of brutal mutilations of American civilians in the Sunni triangle and the unexpected success of insurgencies in the South last week, America\u2019s nation-building effort has stalled. And the prospect of Iraq becoming a self-sufficient and stable society in the near future is dim.</span></p> <p><span>Regrettably, though, the only way to effectively reestablish order in the cities Iraqi rebels took over last week is to increase our occupational presence and encourage hesitant governments to honor current commitments.</span></p> <p><span>The recent Sunni-Shiite common front has demonstrated that the U.S. military presence in Iraq just isn\u2019t cutting it, especially when the Americans can\u2019t keep effective control of major cities such as Falluja and Ramadi. No longer are occupational troops only forced to quell the small-time operations of Sunni extremists, whose attacks\u2014though demoralizing\u2014were less destructive and more infrequent before the recent assistance of Shiite militia. Rather, the current alliance has resulted in increasing violence and a loss of control in important cities, while continuing to refute President Bush\u2019s rash claims that major combat is over. The situation on the ground confirms fears that a large, expensive, long-term military presence and effective security force is the only solution.</span></p> <p><span>Since the American presence in Iraq has proven so ineffective, U.S. troops should also resist the urge to quickly retake those cities still suffering from the recent insurgency. A hasty response with insufficient troops, which cannot adequately provide the security required, could be disastrous. We must now wait before attempting to regain control. Though allowing the cities to remain in disarray is not desirable, we cannot risk further failures and the loss of additional troops. Military strategists should hold off until the occupying powers are really ready to provide an effective security force. And, once in place, they must pursue a policy which does not tolerate those inciting violence against the occupational troops.</span></p> <p><span>As one American official remarked, the battle in Iraq is no longer one of hearts and minds. It is time to realize that Iraq differs from Europe after World War II, where the victorious nations emerged as revered powers. Unfortunately, the occupational forces have failed to gain the acceptance of the Iraqi people, yet they must still endeavor to fulfill their original aims. The campaign cannot be abandoned in the light of the renewed insurgence, and it is the responsibility of the U.S.-led coalition to ensure a lasting stability.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Agreeing With Ourselves | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>\u201cThe real world\u201d is of constant interest to Harvard students. Its beck and call is apparent when a humanities-oriented freshman capitulates to the \u201cadvice\u201d of his parents\u2014that medicine, for instance, worked out as a decent career choice for them and might do so for the progeny as well. Potential aid workers put fuzziness aside and take French. Those who see MBAs in their future seek entry to final clubs for valuable connections or manage Harvard Student Agencies divisions. We do, in short, what we can to prepare for that day when we are forced to summarize the collegiate experience into a resume intended for a would-be employer\u2019s hand.</span></p> <p><span>Beyond the practical, though, there\u2019s an unambiguous difference between Harvard and most of America that undergrads are woefully unable to deal with: the realm of everyday ideology and politics.</span></p> <p><span>At some points, Harvard\u2019s prevailing liberal winds have rendered a few organizations\u2019 core goals more or less satisfied. Look to \u201cGaypril,\u201d the month-long string of political and social events run by the Bisexual, Gay, Lesbian, Transgender and Supporters Alliance (BGLTSA) for evidence of this. ROTC is banned from campus. Gay students, on the other hand, have a vast wealth of resources at their disposal\u2014BGLTS tutors are in nearly every House, weekly support groups meet in throngs and many rooms in a good deal of dorms has a \u201csafe space\u201d sticker on it. Even in conservative circles, gay students are welcomed with open arms. All of these accomplishments have made the gay rights agenda at Harvard radically different from the agenda elsewhere\u2014where similar organizations might still be in the \u201cwe\u2019re here, we\u2019re queer\u201d phase. Nowadays, Harvard\u2019s BGLTSA prefers to host sex toys and S/M workshops, two prominent Gaypril events, and focus its political activism on the University\u2019s \u201cheteronormativity\u201d\u2014manifest in the group\u2019s most recent project of tallying the gender-specific bathrooms on campus and demanding they become unisex.</span></p> <p><span>This leads to great coming-home stories. A fellow Montanan, returning home from an Ivy League school, dropped the newly-reclaimed word \u201cqueer\u201d at the family dinner table only to be stared back at with doe-eyed gawks. Perhaps this is Harvard\u2019s curious way of preparing naive bumpkins for ideological persuasion on provincial battle fronts. But it\u2019s peculiar that while BGLTSA unflinchingly welcomes a group called the \u201cLesbian Avengers\u201d\u2014I\u2019m not sure what they\u2019re here to avenge\u2014a handful of \u201cblue states\u201d are debating gay marriage, and the rest of the country is stuck on the vintage, and less amusing, question of whether homosexuality is, as the Los Angeles Times asked poll respondents this past week, \u201cagainst God\u2019s will.\u201d (Six in 10 said it was). To use Harvard terms to describe this finding might yield, as one contrarian Salient editor emeritus put it in a Salient e-mail list posting, a headline along the lines of: \u201cPoll: Most Americans are anti-gay bigots.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>I\u2019m willing to cast ballots against those who would pass a federal amendment banning gay marriage, just as I would against those who think an S/M workshop is A-OK\u2014but whatever someone\u2019s personal misgivings about the issue is besides the point. Rather, what\u2019s tragic about the gay rights fight in the Capitol and the \u201cgay rights\u201d fight at Harvard is that they so often resemble two ships passing in the night.</span></p> <p><span>Likewise, the debate over Iraq at Harvard isn\u2019t so much whether to keep intact American control of the Coalition Provisional Authority or to hand it to the United Nations. Instead, the options debated (or, at times, shouted over Harvard Initiative for Peace and Justice megaphones) betwixt the Left and the Far Left are whether to hand control to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan or to \u201cend the occupation\u201d altogether.</span></p> <p><span>And the list goes on. Do you want the Bush tax cuts repealed, or should America transform into Sweden version 2.0? Will you welcome ROTC back with open arms only when Congress abandons \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell,\u201d or do you shudder at the notion of the military on campus, period? Do you really hate Bush, or would you kill him if you had a chance?</span></p> <p><span>Some groups have wisely focused on struggles that start at Mass. Hall\u2019s doorstep and don\u2019t sound so silly: giving more workers full-time jobs or stopping layoffs. Whatever the logic of the crusades of the Progessive Student Labor Movement, at least that organization is connecting with the real concerns of hardened folks\u2014though, as happened at Yale, it seems inevitable that there will come a day when \u201cworker\u2019s rights\u201d for a Harvard student means nodding gleefully at unionization for both dining hall staff and teaching fellows.</span></p> <p><span>One thing stands out about all these debates\u2014they\u2019re arguments of privilege. The grunts of revulsion at Bush\u2019s eighth-grade vocabulary, more puerile than funny three years into the term, represent an unthoughtful disdain that ostensibly worldly Harvard grads can hardly afford. It reflects a bourgeois kind of liberalism that doesn\u2019t belong to either the vast swathes of \u201cred\u201d country or to most of liberal America, where the gristle of labor unions or socially conservative minorities dominates. Unless \u201cthe real world\u201d for a typical Harvard student will mean an eternally sheltered life in academia, the perennially-fuzzy international community or Long Island, I detect a deception.</span></p> <p><span><i>Travis R.

The three-pronged attack scored four unanswered goals in the final frame of action to put Minnesota (30-4-2, 19-3-2 WCHA) on top 6-2 and send the Crimson (30-4-1, 15-3-0 ECAC) home with a loss in the finals for the second year in a row.</span></p> <p><span>The Golden Gophers' third period marked a total shift from the game's first two.</span></p> <p><span>\"We talked about 'this is our chance to reach our goals,'\" said Minnesota coach Laura Halldorson. \"And one of the things we talked about at the beginning of the year was to meet [President] George [Bush]\u2014that was one of our goals. We\u2019ve seen other teams go to the White House and we wanted to go.\"</span></p> <p><span>In the final frame of the championship game, Darwitz struck first, starting Harvard\u2019s demise just nine seconds into the third period.</span></p> <p><span>She received a pass from Wendell off the opening faceoff and took the puck along the left side, out-skating Ruggiero to the faceoff circle, where she fired a shot at sophomore Ali Boe.</span></p> <p><span>Darwitz skated in past co-captain Angela Ruggiero and knocked in the rebound past Boe\u2019s right, but as soon as the officials signaled a goal, Boe and the rest of the Crimson turned in protest and the goal was put under review.</span></p> <p><span>The controversy arose because an official blew his whistle prematurely and after Harvard's protests the officials called a timeout to review the play.</span></p> <p><span>During the post-game press conference, Carolyn Campbell-McGovern, chair of the NCAA Women's Frozen Four Committee and the Senior Associate Director of the Ivy Group, issued a statement on behalf of the NCAA explaining the officials' ruling.</span></p> <p><span>The referee ruled that the whistle had blown after the puck crossed the line and the goal stood\u2014setting the record for quickest goal score in a period at nine seconds, breaking the old mark of 21 seconds set by Jennifer Botterill '02-'03 last year.</span></p> <p><span>\"Sometimes the game just goes your way and sometimes it doesn\u2019t,\" Ruggiero said. \"We kept our composure and were fighting.\"</span></p> <p><span>Just 32 game seconds after Darwitz's goal\u2014more than a few minutes had passed due to the officials' timeout\u2014Stephens scored by deflecting a Wendell shot taken from the left faceoff circle past Boe's left.</span></p> <p><span>With 19 minutes left, the Crimson had a chance to fight back into the game. But the two goals signaled a complete change in momentum that seemed to break the spirit of the skaters\u2014especially Boe.</span></p> <p><span>In the next few minutes immediately following the Gophers' fourth goal, the Crimson showed signs of life and gave the Harvard faithful reason to believe in a comeback.</span></p> <p><span>Junior Nicole Corriero, despite having at least two Gophers trying to drag her down each time she campaigned toward the net, trudged along and fired shot after shot at Minnesota goalie Jody Horak, finishing with nine shots on goal for the game.</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately, her only goal came in the second period off a Ruggiero set-up, and she wasn\u2019t able to snap the Gophers' dominance in the final frame.</span></p> <p><span>As the end of the game drew near, Harvard had more and more trouble putting together quality scoring opportunities and holding the puck deep in the Gopher's defensive zone.</span></p> <p><span>\"We put a lot of pressure on them down the stretch of the game\u2014if we had been tired we probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to do that,\" Stone said.</span></p> <p><span>The nail in the coffin might very well have come on Wendell's goal at 6:54\u2014Minnesota\u2019s fifth of the game and fourth unanswered.</span></p> <p><span>\"We had smiles on our faces for that third period, and we never let up and enjoyed every minute of it,\" Halldorson said.</span></p> <p><span>Darwitz rounded out the period with a hat trick with slightly less than seven minutes left in the game.</span></p> <p><span>\"Sometimes against a fast team, you just look like you're running around a little bit,\" Stone said. \"We didn't make it easy on ourselves when we did put the puck in deep. We lost it at the blue line a lot of the time. Every once in awhile, we just got caught watching instead of participating.\"</span></p> <p><span>The game's finish was a difficult and disappointing ending after the Crimson's solid start.</span></p> <p><span>Although Minnesota dominated the opening minutes in the number of shots they got on Boe, the Crimson got on the board first.</span></p> <p><span>Seven minutes into the game, the Gophers held a 6-1 advantage in shots\u2014a statistical dominance that Harvard usually sees in its favor\u2014but was simply flinging shots from wherever they had a chance as opposed to crashing the net and getting the rebounds. The latter style of play led to the third period barrage of goals for Minnesota.</span></p> <p><span>Following their final practice, however, Halldorson had said that the Gophers style of play was not to simply fire away every chance they have.</span></p> <p><span>\"We are not the kind of team that shoots every chance we get,\" Halldorson said. \"It\u2019s not about sheer numbers, but we want to get to the net and create great opportunities.\"</span></p> <p><span>But it was the Crimson who seemed to adhere to this style early on, when junior Kat Sweet sent the Harvard fans into a craze with the game\u2019s first goal.</span></p> <p><span>Right before the 13-minute mark in the first period, freshman Katie Johnston sent the puck to classmate Caitlin Cahow at the point. Cahow then fired the puck towards the right side of the net and found Sweet, who managed to get the end of her stick on the puck and jump it top shelf past Horak's left.</span></p> <p><span>But the goal was not the only solid scoring chance for the Crimson in a period in which it was outshot 13-7 by the Gophers.</span></p> <p><span>Twice, Corriero sparked the offense by taking the puck up through the defense herself and trying to fake Horak or beat her to the right side.</span></p> <p><span>On the second of these opportunities\u2014which came with 9:15 to play in the first\u2014her shot was partly stopped by Horak and partly by Minnesota defensman Allie Sanchez. But neither got a handle on the puck, which found its way over to co-captain Lauren McAuliffe on the left side of the crease. While Horak's right leg lay extended back after trying to stop Corriero\u2019s shot, McAuliffe picked the puck up off the ice and tried to jump it into the net. Her shot clanged off the inside of the right post, causing the red light behind the glass to flash, though the officials ultimately ruled that the puck had never crossed the goal line.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard's chances came from a dump-and-chase style that tested the young Minnesota defense.</span></p> <p><span>\"If there is a weak spot in their game, it's their defensemen,\" Stone said. \"We were trying to pinch on the boards a little bit and wreak a little havoc with their defensemen.  I think it did work for a while.\"</span></p> <p><span>But in the third period, Minnesota's first line took over the game and proved too much for Harvard to handle.</span></p> <p><span>For the Crimson, it was a bitter end to what was a spectacular quest for the national championship.</span></p> <p><span>For the Gophers, it was victory at long last.</span></p> <p><span>\"I have never in my life gotten to throw my gloves up,\" Darwitz said. \"I've been in these games, I've been in world championships and we've always gotten second. But I don't think this feeling is going to go away for a while.</span></p> <p><span>\"This is sweet. This is awesome.\"</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff writer John R.

{"title": "Rethinking Federal Financial Aid | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Almost everyone agrees that a college education should be available to anyone, regardless of socioeconomic background. But when the federal government sits down to reform the system of grants it gives to colleges for financial aid, schools like Harvard inevitably get hurt. The longest-established college in the country, Harvard stands to lose around $6 million after a federal redistribution of grants recently proposed by the Bush administration. This is because some older New England schools, including Harvard, have profited from a skewed, outdated formula that determines how much federal aid each school gets.</span></p> <p><span>Although Harvard and schools like it will lose, the system as it stands is blatantly unfair; reform is a bigger priority. We recognize that the University\u2019s enormous endowment does not insulate it from million dollar losses in federal aid, but basic equity demands that we support a new federal formula.</span></p> <p><span>The new grant rules come with the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act (HEA) this year. First enacted in 1965, the HEA ratifies three essential federal student-aid programs\u2014College Work-Study, Perkins Loans and Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants. The inadequacy of the present allocation is unsurprising given that the underlying formula was devised more than 20 years ago. Known as the \u201cbase guarantee,\u201d the formula in place now gives established colleges the same share of aid every year, and it has become progressively more out of touch with current changes in college demography. Increasingly, low-income students are enrolling in cheaper community and for-profit two-year and four-year colleges. Yet these schools are neglected in the current system, as little money remains after funding established colleges. In their present form, federal student-aid programs are no longer serving some of country\u2019s most needy students.</span></p> <p><span>So, we are glad to see that President Bush is acting to make the system fairer for newer schools and the lower-income students enrolled in them. That said, as it stands, the details of the administration\u2019s plans to revamp federal funding are unclear. We hope that the president and Congress will require that all institutions that eventually receive federal aid meet minimum thresholds of academic integrity. This system must not be exploited by fly-by-night schools that are unequipped to deliver quality education. In these cases, funding is more productively used by established institutions with credible track-records.</span></p> <p><span>But smarter allocations will only alleviate half of the problem. The total federal pie for financial aid should also increase. Investing in the future of young people is among the most productive uses of capital. College graduates are less likely to be unemployed and greatly contribute to national tax revenue. A larger pool of college-educated citizens not only benefits the nation by promoting higher future growth, but it also enriches society and culture.</span></p> <p><span>In this regard, increasing expenditures on Pell Grants and other federal aid programs is vital. As the number of students attending college continues to grow, funds are increasingly spread thinner among applicants. The number of students receiving the Pell Grant is expected to grow by more than 20 percent this year relative to 2000. While the monetary value of each award has increased over time, it has not kept up with rising prices\u2014$12 billion dollars is needed to restore the purchasing power of Pell Grants to its level in the 1970s. This is a lot of money, but it constitutes only a fraction of the dividends and capital gains component of the Bush tax cut.</span></p> <p><span>But, predictably, instead of providing more funds in aggregate, the Bush administration has recently reduced college aid and proposed harmful new rules for financial assistance. In his proposal to Congress on the Higher Education Act, for instance, the president suggests raising loan limits for college first-years\u2014a move that will almost certainly amplify the financial burden of education for the nation\u2019s neediest citizens. President Bush was right to ask for a new formula for distributing the federal funds already allocated for higher education. But if he really wants to make a difference, he has to get more money into the hands of those who need it most.</span></p>"}

The three-pronged attack scored four unanswered goals in the final frame of action to put Minnesota (30-4-2, 19-3-2 WCHA) on top 6-2 and send the Crimson (30-4-1, 15-3-0 ECAC) home with a loss in the finals for the second year in a row.</span></p> <p><span>The Golden Gophers\u2019 third period marked a total shift from the game\u2019s first two.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe talked about \u2018this is our chance to reach our goals,\u2019\u201d said Minnesota coach Laura Halldorson. \u201cAnd one of the things we talked about at the beginning of the year was to meet [President] George [Bush]\u2014that was one of our goals. We\u2019ve seen other teams go to the White House and we wanted to go.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In the final frame of the championship game, Darwitz struck first, starting Harvard\u2019s demise just nine seconds into the third period.</span></p> <p><span>She received a pass from Wendell off the opening faceoff and took the puck along the left side, out-skating Ruggiero to the faceoff circle, where she fired a shot at sophomore Ali Boe.</span></p> <p><span>Darwitz skated in past co-captain Angela Ruggiero and knocked in the rebound past Boe\u2019s right side, but as soon as the officials signaled a goal, Boe and the rest of the Crimson turned in protest and the goal was put under review, to no avail.</span></p> <p><span>Just 32 game seconds after Darwitz\u2019s goal\u2014more than a few minutes had passed due to the officials\u2019 timeout to review the play\u2014Stephens scored by deflecting a Wendell shot taken from the left faceoff circle past Boe\u2019s left.</span></p> <p><span>In the next few minutes immediately following the Gophers\u2019 fourth goal, the Crimson showed signs of life and gave the Harvard faithful reason to believe in a comeback.</span></p> <p><span>Junior Nicole Corriero, despite having at least two Gophers trying to drag her down each time she campaigned toward the net, trudged along and fired shot after shot at Minnesota goalie Jody Horak, finishing with nine shots on goal for the game. Unfortunately, her only goal came in the second period off a Ruggiero set-up, and she wasn\u2019t able to snap the Gophers\u2019 dominance in the final frame.</span></p> <p><span>As the end of the game drew near, Harvard had more and more trouble putting together quality scoring opportunities and holding the puck deep in the Gopher\u2019s defensive zone.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe put a lot of pressure on them down the stretch of the game\u2014if we had been tired we probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to do that,\u201d Stone said.</span></p> <p><span>The nail in the coffin might very well have come on Wendell\u2019s goal at 6:54\u2014Minnesota\u2019s fifth of the game and fourth unanswered.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe had smiles on our faces for that third period, and we never let up and enjoyed every minute of it,\u201d Halldorson said.</span></p> <p><span>Darwitz rounded out the period with a hat trick with slightly less than seven minutes left in the game.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cSometimes against a fast team, you just look like you\u2019re running around a little bit,\u201d Stone said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t make it easy on ourselves when we did put the puck in deep. We lost it at the blue line a lot of the time. Every once in awhile, we just got caught watching instead of participating.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The game\u2019s finish was a difficult and disappointing ending after the Crimson\u2019s solid start.</span></p> <p><span>Seven minutes into the game, the Gophers held a 6-1 advantage in shots\u2014a statistical dominance that Harvard usually sees in its favor\u2014but was simply flinging shots from wherever they had a chance as opposed to crashing the net and getting the rebounds. The latter style of play led to the third-period barrage of goals for Minnesota.</span></p> <p><span>But it was the Crimson who seemed to adhere to this style early on, when junior Kat Sweet sent the Harvard fans into a craze with the game\u2019s first goal.</span></p> <p><span>Right before the 13-minute mark in the first period, freshman Katie Johnston sent the puck to classmate Caitlin Cahow at the point. Cahow then fired the puck towards the right side of the net and found Sweet, who managed to get the end of her stick on the puck and jump it top shelf past Horak\u2019s left.</span></p> <p><span>But the goal was not the only solid scoring chance for the Crimson in a period in which it was outshot 13-7 by the Gophers. Twice Corriero sparked the offense by taking the puck up through the defense herself and trying to fake Horak or beat her to the right side.</span></p> <p><span>On the second of these opportunities\u2014which came with 9:15 to play in the first\u2014her shot was stopped partly by Horak and partly by Minnesota defensman Allie Sanchez. But neither got a handle on the puck, which found its way over to co-captain Lauren McAuliffe on the left side of the crease. While Horak\u2019s right leg lay extended back after trying to stop Corriero\u2019s shot, McAuliffe picked the puck up off the ice and tried to jump it into the net. Her shot clanged off the inside of the right post, causing the red light behind the glass to flash, though the officials ultimately ruled that the puck had never crossed the goal line.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard\u2019s chances came from a dump-and-chase style that tested the young Minnesota defense.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf there is a weak spot in their game, it\u2019s their defensemen,\u201d Stone said. \u201cWe were trying to pinch on the boards a little bit and wreak a little havoc with their defensemen. I think it did work for a while.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But in the third period, Minnesota\u2019s first line took over the game and proved too much for Harvard to handle.</span></p> <p><span>For the Crimson, it was a bitter end to what was a spectacular quest for the national championship. For the Gophers, it was victory at long last.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI have never in my life gotten to throw my gloves up,\u201d Darwitz said. \u201cI\u2019ve been in these games, I\u2019ve been in world championships and we\u2019ve always gotten second. But I don\u2019t think this feeling is going to go away for a while.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis is sweet. This is awesome.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff writer Gabriel M.

{"title": "Stern Reality for the GOP | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Sadly, the chances that Air America Radio and the new liberal radio program hosted by Al Franken \u201973, will have more than a marginal influence on this country\u2019s political climate are next to nothing. As one observer noted, conservative programs like those hosted by Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity are popular because conservative ideas are relatively simple and unsophisticated\u2014and that\u2019s exactly the level of discourse that\u2019s likely to capture the attention of the apathetic, uncommitted voters who decide elections. As hilarious as he is, Franken and his rhetoric don\u2019t fit that profile.</span></p> <p><span>Instead, the swing voters in this year\u2019s elections will be lured by one of their own; that is, the voice that should agitate the incumbents of Capitol Hill and the White House\u2014and perhaps already has\u2014is none other than Howard Stern\u2019s. Not a political commentator by trade, but with (until recently) an extraordinarily wide audience of 16 million, Stern has remarkable political power. Because his bias is neither consistently conservative nor consistently liberal, he enjoys a level of political credibility that more dogmatically motivated hosts can never hope to conquer.</span></p> <p><span>Stern\u2019s talk is many things\u2014vulgar, offensive and sometimes disparaging of other cultures\u2014but one thing it\u2019s not, is out of touch. Since the destruction of the World Trade Center, the substance of his political comments has fluctuated in sync with the Bush administration\u2019s approval ratings. In the fall of 2001 and the winter of 2002, he alternated fervent celebrations of the courageous rescue workers who gave their lives with crude, reproachful generalizations directed at the loathed \u201ctowel-heads.\u201d In the spring and summer of 2003, amidst strong popular support for the victorious commander-in-chief, he viciously lashed out at the French for failing to help us in our just war on Iraq. And today, as Bush\u2019s triumphs past are forgotten\u2014or debunked\u2014the White House\u2019s poll numbers hover dangerously low. Stern, ever faithful to capricious public opinion, has now become a valuable and improbable advocate for presidential hopeful Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., lauding his environmental and economic plans. And when comparing his illustrious security record to the incumbent\u2019s, Stern rants that the latter has \u201cno clue\u201d what it is to risk one\u2019s life in the defense of one\u2019s country.</span></p> <p><span>For all its strategies to befriend simple people\u2014a slow-witted figurehead, two tax cuts for the rich masquerading as generous lump-sum refunds for working folks and two crusades against the \u201cevil\u201d worshippers of Allah\u2014the Bush administration sacrificed one of its best assets when it decided to make a big to-do about its alliance with the religious right. For two years the King of All Media galvanized a considerable audience of political dummies in the president\u2019s support. But their differences on fundamental peacetime social issues like abortion, gay marriage and, most powerfully, freedom of expression now threaten to loosen the hold Bush has likely had on Stern\u2019s audience, made up of the same ordinary people whom the administration has always sought to attract.</span></p> <p><span>If Republican strategists are rightly unflustered in the face of Franken\u2019s FM adventures, they should turn their dials to Stern as they sip their morning coffee and come to terms with the inspiration he\u2019s capable of generating. They might consider, too, that Clear Channel doesn\u2019t further their cause when it decides to drop a talk show two days after its host scorns the president, effectively transforming part of the broadcast on the remaining stations into an NPR fundraiser-style segment. And this drive won\u2019t be over until the Bible-toting administration gets out of Stern\u2019s way\u2014and out of everyone else\u2019s, for that matter. Unless Bush keeps in touch with what really matters to his people, as he did for two years and as Stern has to this day, he\u2019ll have to take his job creation plans with him back to Crawford.</span></p> <p><span><i>Daniel B.

Make that really deep. With 22 skilled players on the roster, this year\u2019s Crimson fields one of the most talented teams in recent memory. But it didn\u2019t always look so good.</span></p> <p><span>The softball squad had a big hole to fill with the graduation of first baseman Tiffany Whitton, a 2003 ECAC honorable mention, the 2002 Ivy League Player of the Year, and Harvard\u2019s all-time career and single season home run leader.</span></p> <p><span>Add that loss to the last year\u2019s disappointing 15-26 record (7-7 Ivy) and the team needed to rebound.</span></p> <p><span>After recruiting a freshman class of reliable talent in every aspect of the game, snagging a star transfer player, and harnessing old talent, the 2004 team is full of spunk, skill, and commitment. It\u2019s on a campaign to rebuild the program, and in terms of expectations, the sky is the limit. It\u2019s already off to a 4-5 start against tough non-Ivy League teams.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis is probably one of the most focused teams I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d head coach Jenny Allard says. \u201cWhen you have a year that you\u2019re frustrated with and just so inconsistent, you come back the next year really hungry.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>This year, there is hunger at every position, as every starter is backed up by a legitimate challenger.</span></p> <p><span><b>THE PITCHING STAFF</b></span></p> <p><span>The force of the infield begins with co-captain and pitcher Kara Brotemarkle, who, after three seasons, already ranks third on Harvard\u2019s all-time strikeout list with 272 and threw her first no-hitter last season against Columbia. Her supporting cast on the mound includes junior Lauren Bettinelli, a reliable utility player at almost any infield position. She was initially pegged as a second baseman and only stormed onto the pitching scene last spring, welcomed with instant success.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cLast year, she says to me, coach, can I try pitching this year?\u201d Allard recalls. \u201cAnd I said sure. It was one of the best \u2018sure\u2019 decisions I\u2019ve made.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In her first season pitching for Harvard, Bettinelli had an ERA of 3.14 and fanned 28 batters in 2003.</span></p> <p><span>Sophomore Michele McAteer also returns for the Crimson after seeing considerable playing time last year, racking up 66 strikeouts with an ERA of 3.74.</span></p> <p><span>Rounding out the pitching staff is freshman Becky Voaklander, who recently started and pitched her first complete game, an 11-2 victory against Liberty.</span></p> <p><span><b>THE INFIELD</b></span></p> <p><span>Behind the plate, junior Notre Dame transfer Annie Dell\u2019Aria has already claimed an important role.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cShe\u2019s got it all as a catcher,\u201d Allard says. \u201cShe blocks well. She has a great quick release down to second base.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Dell\u2019Aria\u2019s bat has also made her a powerful force in the batting order, batting in the clean-up spot.</span></p> <p><span>Junior Laura Miller returns to the backstop along with sophomore Erin Halpenny, both of whom have considerable experience with the Crimson.</span></p> <p><span>Freshman Sarah Shaughnessy also hopes to see some time, but she begins the season with an ankle fracture, sitting 4-6 weeks while it heals.</span></p> <p><span>One of the biggest strengths of this year\u2019s infield is up the middle, where senior shortstop Rachel Goldberg and co-captain second baseman Sara Williamson start next to each other for the fourth consecutive year.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAfter four years, it\u2019s incredibly comfortable,\u201d Goldberg says. \u201cWe constantly banter for seven innings and have a great time together. We communicate well and have a lot of fun.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Goldberg and Williamson also match up in the batting order, in the top half, allotted to reliable base hitters and power swingers.</span></p> <p><span>In 2003, Goldberg led the team with 7 home runs and was third on the team in hits with 30, helping herself to a .248 batting average. Williamson had the fifth highest batting average with a .265.</span></p> <p><span>Freshmen Lauren Brown and Julia Kidder are close on the heels of the two seniors, ready to fill in at shortstop and second base, respectively, if needed.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe difference between them is just experience,\u201d Allard says. \u201cWe\u2019re giving [Brown and Kidder] time. They\u2019re at that caliber, but because we have some really seasoned players in positions that they play, their time might be more limited or more specialized.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The natural replacement for the graduated Whitton at first base is junior Cecily Gordon, who has seen quite a bit of playing time in her career despite backing up one of Harvard\u2019s most touted players. In 34 at-bats last season, she had an on base percentage of .351 and should be a force to reckon with this spring. When Gordon isn\u2019t at first, Dell\u2019Aria and Voaklander will move over.</span></p> <p><span>With sophomore Rachel Murray nursing an arm injury, third base was one of the only positions up for grabs this season. Freshman Virginia Fritsch snagged it early with a big bat and strong arm. Halpenny is also expected to see some time at third.</span></p> <p><span><b>THE OUTFIELD</b></span></p> <p><span>Junior Lauren Stefanchik, the anchor of the outfield, returns to left field. She received first team all Ivy honors last year and is looking to make a similar impact this year.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cFor myself, I\u2019m just trying to get on base and get our offense solid,\u201d Stefanchik says. \u201cI want to stay solid in the outfield.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>It\u2019s not just in the outfield where Stefanchik anchors this team. Last season, she led the Ivy League with the most bases stolen and Harvard with the longest hitting streak (14 games) and highest batting average (.389). As the leadoff hitter, she had an on-base percentage of .434.</span></p> <p><span>Joining Stefanchik in the outfield is sophomore Kerry Flaherty, a  centerfielder who moved over from right. In an off-season of change, Flaherty also switched to \u201cslapping\u201d from the left side of the plate instead of power hitting from the right side.</span></p> <p><span>Returning to the Crimson is senior Monica Montijo, who is also changing things up with a move to right field from her old position of catcher.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cOriginally, we were going to put her back behind the plate,\u201d Allard says. \u201cBut we felt we needed someone really aggressive in right field, and we didn\u2019t think her body could hold up with the catching.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Sophomore Pilar Adams, freshman Susie Winkeller, Brown, and Kidder are also expected to make an impact from the outfield. Sophomore Cara Woodard is sidelined with a torn ACL but is hoping to make a late season return.</span></p> <p><span>If this year\u2019s team is going to improve from last year\u2019s disappointment, the depth of the roster will play a major role in the campaign. With legitimate challengers at every position, the hunger of each player that will determine where this team ends up.</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff writer Carrie H.

Howard Dean is that kind of leader.</span></p> <p><span>While we believe that John Kerry is the best candidate to put the Democratic message before the voters this November, there is no question that Governor Dean has shown the kind of skills that the DNC needs.</span></p> <p><span>First, Dean has shown an ability to raise small donations from the grassroots of the Party. With more than a quarter of a million donors, most donating less than $100, Dean shattered Democratic fundraising records in a race with nine candidates competing for the dollars and the support of the Party faithful.</span></p> <p><span>Democrats usually lag far behind Republicans in hard money donations, which by law are limited to no more than $2,000 per individual. In the first six months of the 2003-2004 election cycle, Democrats raised nearly $83 million less than Republicans in hard money. After the passage of the Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act, popularly known as McCain-Feingold, the soft-money donations that Democrats have used to overcome the Republican hard-money advantage are illegal. Even before they were illegal, these massive donations from corporations, labor unions and wealthy individuals undermined the Democrats\u2019 populist rhetoric and diverted the Party\u2019s focus away from the grassroots. Dean is the one Democrat who has shown the ability to build a national campaign on small donations. His experience and talent could go a long way towards making the Democrats competitive in the post-McCain-Feingold world and legitimizing the Democratic claim of being the party of the people.</span></p> <p><span>Dean has also shown that he can excite the Democratic Party base. During his primary campaign, Dean signed up more than half a million voters on his website, and he used far more volunteers in both New Hampshire and Iowa than any of the other campaigns. More importantly, Dean built his support by standing up for core Democratic principles, from multilateral foreign policy to universal healthcare.</span></p> <p><span>As DNC Chair, McAuliffe shied away from promoting ideological cohesion in the Democratic Party. Under his leadership, the Democrats were largely unable to present a unified message in the face of the Republican\u2019s radical platform. McAuliffe\u2019s decision indicated a focus on moderate voters at the expense of the Democratic base. In contrast, the Republicans have been successful by playing to their base and refusing to compromise their principles. To counter the Republican\u2019s radical agenda, the Democrats must clearly articulate their own vision. Dean could build the kind of grassroots movement that would allow the Democrats to stand up for their ideas.</span></p> <p><span>Finally, Dean has the administrative experience to manage an organization like the DNC. He has served as the head of the Democratic Governor\u2019s Association and the National Governor\u2019s Association. In both those positions, he showed an ability to work with all kinds of leaders to promote common interests. As Governor of Vermont, Dean was a prudent fiscal manager who expanded important social services while balancing the budget for 11 straight years. The DNC, which suffers from a multi-million dollar deficit, could use a shrewd money manager like Dean.</span></p> <p><span>Dean\u2019s current project, Democracy for America, reveals why Dean would be a major improvement for the DNC. Democracy for America is focused on building a grassroots movement to get rid of George W. Bush. At the same time, the organization is helping progressive Democrats receive the money they need to be competitive. Dean did not abandon the Democratic Party after failing to win the presidential nomination, nor did he give up fighting for his beliefs. He is finding innovative new ways to help the Democrats while rejuvenating the party from within. This is exactly what the DNC should be doing.</span></p> <p><span>The DNC will not select its new Chairman until after the November elections. But, as Dean showed, grassroots effort is the only way to make significant change in the Democratic Party or in the nation, and those changes take time. To that end, several former Dean staffers have launched a website to draft Dean to run for DNC Chair, and to encourage Democrats to elect him. The website, www.deanfordemocrats.com, is the beginning of what we hope will be a massive effort to reshape the Democratic Party for the new millennium.</span></p>"}

Frazer has been nominated for an appointment as the U.S. Ambassador to South Africa.</span></p> <p><span>Frazer had been teaching public policy at KSG on and off since 1995 before she left her position late last year.</span></p> <p><span>Since 2001, she has been working as the senior director for African affairs at the National Security Council and a special assistant to President Bush.</span></p> <p><span>According to her former KSG colleagues, the March 16 nomination came as no surprise. Dillon Professor of Government Graham T. Allison Jr. said members of the Bush administration have had their eye on Frazer since her graduate school days. He said National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice recommended Frazer for the associate professorship at KSG.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhen the Bush administration entered, [Frazer] had already known Condi Rice when [Frazer] was a graduate student,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember when we were recruiting her, Condi called me and said, \u2018This is a star.\u2019\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Allison pointed out that Frazer currently occupies a high-level position within the White House and all affairs having to do with African foreign policy go through her.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMy impression is that she\u2019s done an excellent job there, and I\u2019m sure [the nomination] is on that basis, because she\u2019s been seen by everyone in the U.S. government dealing with Africa,\u201d said Allison, who served as assistant secretary of defense for policy and plans under the first term of the Clinton administration.</span></p> <p><span>If Bush\u2019s nomination is approved by the Senate, Frazer will be placed at the helm of a delicate diplomatic operation, which in recent years has seen the United States open markets and free trade relations with Africa, and provide AIDS relief to its struggling nations.</span></p> <p><span>South Africa has been battling massive unemployment, crime and poverty in the 10 years since the historic 1994 elections, which ended apartheid and transferred power to Nelson Mandela\u2019s African Nationalist Congress.</span></p> <p><span>As Mandela pushed an economic agenda of privatization and free market reform, the effects of apartheid have persisted. According to a recent government report, the five years between 1996 and 2001 have seen the average income for South African blacks decrease by 17 percent as the average income for whites increased by just as much.</span></p> <p><span>In 2003, Frazer accompanied the President to South Africa as part of a tour of the continent. They visited Senegal, Nigeria, Botswana and Uganda\u2014countries Frazer said exemplify a \u201cnew compact of development, which focuses on ruling justly, investing in people and promoting economic freedom,\u201d according to a column on the White House website published before the trip.</span></p> <p><span>As a KSG associate professor, Frazer conducted research on the public policy aspects of intrastate conflict, civil wars and coups.</span></p> <p><span>In 1998, Frazer successfully competed for a fellowship at the Council on Foreign Relations, and took a year-long leave of absence to work with the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the Department of Defense. She briefly returned to Harvard in 2000 before taking another leave of absence when she landed her positions in the White House and the National Security Council.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cShe was a valuable member of the faculty who left to go to work at the Bush Administration,\u201d said Belfer Professor of International Affairs Stephen Walt. \u201cWe\u2019re very proud of her and we wish her well.\u201d  But before she can move to her new home in Johannesburg, Frazer will have to weather a political storm in the Senate, which may cost her the appointment.</span></p> <p><span>Currently listed as \u201cpending\u201d in the records of the U.S. Senate, the nomination will soon fall into the hands of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, where 10 Republicans and nine Democrats will eventually decide whether to put Frazer\u2019s appointment to a general vote in the Senate.</span></p> <p><span>Sources said that Frazer will have no trouble getting past the committee, but a potential filibuster by the Democrats at the senatorial level could hold her back.</span></p> <p><span>Tensions have been palpable on Capitol Hill since Bush\u2019s two recent recess appointments of circuit-court judges. Democrats were further outraged when the president refused to appoint more than a dozen Democrats to government boards and commissions, inspiring Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., to threaten the administration with an unequivocal stall of all judicial nominations.  \u201cThere has to be a reciprocal treatment of nominees,\u201d Daschle said in a March statement. \u201cIt will be very, very difficult for us to move forward on nominations in the future if the matter isn\u2019t resolved.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Sarah Feinberg, a spokesperson for Daschle, said it is unclear whether Frazer will be affected by the standoff, since an ambassadorship is hardly the same thing as a judicial seat.   \u201cIf she gets to the committee quickly and comes in front of the Senate right away, she may get caught in that conflict,\u201d she said.</span></p> <p><span>The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is holding a hearing for three African ambassador nominations today, but Frazer was not on that list as of yesterday afternoon. \u201cOnce you\u2019re in the political season, everything takes on a slightly different flavor,\u201d Allison said, \u201cbut as far as a human being and an academic colleague, she\u2019s excellent.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Leon Neyfakh can be reached at neyfakh@fas.harvard.edu..</span></p>"}
{"title": "Ignoring the Next Sept. 11 | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>What did the president know, and when did he know it? Oh, and what did he do to stop it? Washington buzzed with these questions last week as the Bush administration defended itself against charges from its erstwhile counter-terrorism czar, Richard A. Clarke, that it did not do all it could have to avert the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Amidst this brouhaha, an ominous portent of further and more deadly attacks upon American soil went virtually unnoticed. The North Korean regime of Kim Jong Il, through its mouthpiece Radio Pyongyang, explicitly rejected America\u2019s demand for the \u201ccomplete, verifiable, irreversible dismantling\u201d of its nuclear weapons program. Now that the Kim regime has removed any doubts about its intentions to press forward with its nuclear program, we are confronted with the grave possibility that some of its nuclear materials or weapons will make their way into the hands of terrorists. But the regime\u2019s announcement failed to elicit a response from the White House, suggesting that the administration is once again bogged down in fatal complacency.</span></p> <p><span>The \u201cDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea\u201d (DPRK) has amply demonstrated its enthusiasm for selling illicit arms on the international market. In 2002, for instance, the Spanish navy intercepted a North Korean vessel shipping scud missiles to Yemen. Back in 1998 the DPRK was found to have sold missile technology to Pakistan\u2019s Khan Research Lab. (As in Abdul Qadeer Khan, who confessed this year to selling nuclear technology to Libya and Iran.) The danger that the regime will now sell nuclear weapons to terrorists cannot be brushed aside.</span></p> <p><span>The Bush administration chose force over genuine diplomacy in Iraq, but so far the more tangible threat in the Korean peninsula has prompted it to go to the other extreme: a lot of talk and no action. Of course, war with a state that possesses nuclear weapons and a military of over 1.2 million soldiers is a grisly option; military intervention in North Korea should be avoided at almost any cost. Yet to do nothing while North Korea transforms itself into a nuclear Wal-Mart would be equally reckless. So would bribing the regime into disarmament with promises of economic aid\u2014an idea the administration is now openly entertaining, and which would teach Kim and other unsavory dictators that nuclear saber-rattling pays.</span></p> <p><span>How, then, are we to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions? Ideally, the U.S. should find a way to convince Kim Jong Il that we really don\u2019t harbor any desire to invade North Korea and overthrow his regime, as he seems to believe. Kim\u2019s suspicion that the United States intends to launch \u201ca war of aggression against the DPRK,\u201d as last week\u2019s radio address put it, seems to be the driving motivation behind North Korea\u2019s nuclear build-up. But then, this suspicion, and Kim\u2019s reticence to disarm and readmit weapons inspectors, is not so surprising after what happened to the last member of the Axis of Evil who acquiesced to inspections. After Iraq, it may take a new occupant in the White House to restore America\u2019s credibility and get rogue regimes to abandon their defensive hostility.</span></p> <p><span>But if the regime cannot be dissuaded from developing nukes, it must be deterred from exporting them. The question is how such deterrence can be both tough and (more or less) bloodless. The unsexy field of economics may hold an answer: take away the regime\u2019s incentive to supply its goods to the nuclear market by imposing a total embargo on all trade between North Korea and other nations. (An exemption could be made for food aid.) The embargo would amount to a quarantine along North Korea\u2019s borders and coast, enforced by the U.S., Japan, Russia, China and South Korea. Although no quarantine could make smuggling impossible, by drastically raising the cost of smuggling, the quarantine could make the business thoroughly unprofitable.</span></p> <p><span>Moreover, the CIA estimates that North Korea currently imports over $1.3 billion worth of goods per year, including 85,000 barrels of oil a day. As a result, \u201cthe regime has placed emphasis on earning hard currency.\u201d By preventing North Korea from importing goods, the quarantine could kill its demand for foreign cash and thus its incentive to trade its nuclear wares for foreign currency.</span></p> <p><span>Might not the DPRK retaliate militarily against such a draconian embargo? Not necessarily\u2014the regime would not welcome a war between the United States and North Korea any more than we would. Of course, the risk exists. But what are the alternatives? Strike militarily and guarantee war? Stand by while nukes are sold to the highest bidder?</span></p> <p><span>The fact is, if the administration can not reassure Kim that he does not need nukes\u2014and it appears that Bush has already failed that diplomatic test\u2014we will have to choose from a uniformly unpleasant set of feasible responses. The inevitable risks of any conceivable policy do not obviate the need for a decision; they make it imperative and urgent. The president has yet to face up to that fact. And while the administration remains in a stupor, America is drifting toward the unthinkable.</span></p> <p><span><i>Eoghan W. Stafford \u201906 is a social studies concentrator in Leverett House.

{"title": "Two's Company | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>When President Bush meets in a private session with the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, there will be one too many people in the room. Bush and the 10 members of what\u2019s better known as the Sept. 11 commission will be joined by Vice President Dick Cheney, who will only testify with the president by his side. This would almost be laughable, if it didn\u2019t seriously hurt the commission\u2019s chances of doing its job.</span></p> <p><span>The purpose of the Sept. 11 commission is to determine exactly how sloppy detective work, weak executive oversight and a series of intelligence failures let the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon happen more than two years ago. This is such an essential aim that the panel should have access to whatever\u2014and whomever\u2014it wishes with as few restrictions as possible to effectively gauge the circumstances surrounding the terrorist attacks. In the end, the panel will have to submit a report of its findings to the American people explaining where and how their government failed them, something long overdue years after the national tragedy. To do this, the commission members need as close to a full and honest account of the events from each witness as possible, not a coordinated party line manufactured by Republican political strategists.</span></p> <p><span>So we are glad to hear that National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice will testify under oath and in public before the commission. But the White House\u2019s insistence on the president and the vice president appearing together, is disheartening at best. We are confident that Bush would not willingly manufacture blatant lies and mouth them to the commission; yet with Dick Cheney by his side, Bush will be able to keep his story perfectly consistent with that of one of his closest advisers. One of the most important things the commission has to do in the coming months is compare testimony from top officials, look for discrepancies and finally assign some blame for the administrative missteps that preceded Sept. 11, 2001. That\u2019s impossible when the two most important witnesses get to give tag-team testimony in secret.</span></p> <p><span>And there is every reason to worry that the president is more interested in saving his political hide than in helping the commission he opposed forming in the first place. It almost goes without saying that Bush does not have a stellar track record when it comes to telling the whole truth, especially when it gets in his way; indeed, his manipulation of the facts when it came to Iraq\u2019s \u201cweapons of mass destruction\u201d points to an almost reckless disregard for the real truth. We believe that this time around, just like before, deception, not cooperation is on the president\u2019s mind.</span></p> <p><span>There is no way Bush appearing with Cheney will help the commission; it can only hurt the panel\u2019s struggle to find the truth. We see little justification for joint testimony other than to allow the president and the vice president to avoid getting snared by their own half-truths and shifting stories. If President Bush were really tough on defense, he would be testifying alone like everyone else in an honest effort to aid the commission. But, for now, it looks like we\u2019re stuck with the same old evasive tactics from this White House.</span></p>"}

History has not looked kindly upon our inaction. In recent years former Administration officials, including Madeline Albright and President Clinton himself, have personally apologized for their failures.</span></p> <p><span>But reflection and apologies are cheap. At this very moment our nation again sits idle in the face of yet another African genocide, as a campaign of whole scale ethnic cleansing racks the troubled nation of Sudan. The crisis demands strong leadership and urgent action.  Will President Bush rise to the challenge, or will he repeat the sins of his predecessor?</span></p> <p><span>For the past twenty years, the Sudanese have suffered through an intractable civil war. But the current wave of violence is different. It\u2019s not a religious conflict\u2014all the parties are predominantly Muslim\u2014but rather a conflict rooted in long-simmering ethnic and regional tensions. It began approximately 14 months ago, when the Arab-dominated Sudanese government in Khartoum became embroiled in hostilities with two black African rebel groups based in the vast western region of Darfur. In order to undermine potential rebel support, Khartoum is prosecuting a brutal \u2018scorched-earth\u2019 policy against Darfur\u2019s Blacks. Khartoum has armed nomadic Arab militiamen, the Janjaweed, who are carrying out the atrocities in conjunction with official Sudanese government forces.</span></p> <p><span>The reports are truly shocking: women raped, villages burned, children slaughtered.  The violence has already left an estimated 30,000 dead\u2014approximately 1000 individuals are currently being killed each week\u2014and displaced nearly a million Africans. A lucky hundred thousand refugees have managed to flee into neighboring Chad\u2014itself one of the world\u2019s poorest nations\u2014where the United Nations is currently rushing to settle them in camps before the May wet season makes vehicle transportation all but impossible. But another 700,000 refugees are still trapped in Darfar where they continue to be victimized by roving militias and strafed by Sudanese military jets. With the crops burned, and new ones unable to be planted, international agencies are warning that Darfur may soon suffer serious famine as well. Meanwhile, Khartoum denies international humanitarian groups access to the region.</span></p> <p><span>With the notable exception of New York Times columnist Nicolas Kristof\u2014who has devoted his last three pieces to the issue\u2014and an excellent op-ed in Tuesday\u2019s New York Times by Harvard\u2019s own Samantha Power, the Sudanese crisis has largely been ignored by the Western press. Our leaders have also remained silent. Unfortunately, this comes as little surprise. Compared with the latest dour dispatches from Iraq and the recent revelations in the post-9/11 drama, the troubles of some little known African nation hardly makes for big news.</span></p> <p><span>But the issue\u2019s decided obscurity means that Bush can expect to face little political heat should he choose to look the other way and can likewise expect to receive little credit should he take a strong stance. Absent such political incentives, a strong Bush stand on Sudan is unlikely; it would demonstrate real principle and genuine compassion.</span></p> <p><span>What should the Bush Administration be doing to address the crisis? In her op-ed, Power argues that intervention is not an all or nothing affair\u2014a choice between invasion and inaction\u2014a point, she notes, that is often lost on the Bush administration. To begin with, the President must publicly acknowledge and condemn the atrocities. Bush broached the issue during a phone conversation with the Sudanese President two weeks ago, but a forceful public denunciation would mean more. Intense international pressure may yet persuade the Sudanese government to call off its deadly campaign. Regardless, Power asserts that ten thousand peacekeepers are needed in Darfur to secure the situation. Khartoum would first have to agree to such a mission, a concession that would require additional U.S. leverage. For example, we could threaten to extend sanctions that we are already imposing on Sudan as punishment for their terrorist connections.</span></p> <p><span>In the meantime, other nations, most importantly those in the E.U., must not sit back and wait for the United States to take the lead. In the face of such egregious crimes against humanity, every country has a responsibility to speak out and to act according to its means; U.S. inaction is not an excuse. That African leaders and Muslims leaders have remained silent is especially unconscionable.</span></p> <p><span>Mukesh Kapila, the former United Nations humanitarian coordinator in Sudan, recently called Darfur \u201cthe world\u2019s greatest humanitarian crisis.\u201d He added, \u201cI don\u2019t know why the world isn\u2019t doing more about it.\u201d Unfortunately, reasons for inaction\u2014cowardice, callousness and indifference\u2014are myriad; justifications are not. Our leaders can no longer plead ignorance.

Indeed, the smart money seems to be on a VP pick early in an extremely long presidential race, despite a number of good reasons to wait.

Kerry has to respond to criticism from both President George W. Bush and Vice-President Dick Cheney, and the democratic candidate is at a decided disadvantage in fundraising as a one man show.

Howard Dean peaked too early in this year\u2019s Democratic primaries, as did Al Gore in the last presidential election. The Bush-Cheney campaign has more than enough financial ammunition and media savvy to make a spring running-mate selection old news. So whether Kerry\u2019s ace will be former primary foe John Edwards, Republican buddy John McCain, New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson or anyone else, he should let the speculators speculate and the pundits wonder.

Carmichael \u201904), the subject of a Bruegel painting, and Patient Griselda (Sarah E. Curtis \u201905), the obedient wife from Chaucer\u2019s <i>Canterbury Tales</i>. \u00a0The women not so much share their stories over the dinner table as try to one-up each other with their experiences. \u00a0Although the setup for the scene was promising, this act waned compared to the others. \u00a0With so many characters competing for prominence, it was at times a head-splitting experience to grasp the importance of each, especially when combined with the distractedly noisy entrances and exits of the waitress (Alex H. Bush \u201906) and the sporadic rotation of the dinner table. \u00a0While the rotation of the table, and hence, the position of the characters was an innovative solution to a challenging staging problem, it proved to be too much to stomach at once.</span></p> <p><span>Jerista and Thompson at times were guilty of overacting in the first act during their fight for prominence. Carmichael\u2019s presence was a welcome one in her ability to express physically what the others seemed to have difficulty with on a verbal level. \u00a0Firestone\u2019s Joan was tastefully well done\u2014the entire theatre came to a standstill as she described the details of an unexpected childbirth and subsequent death with an eerie calm.</span></p> <p><span>Subsequent acts speeded up relative to the first act\u2019s lagging pace. \u00a0It turns out that the dinner guests were merely figments of Marlene\u2019s imagination, elements of her psychological struggle for peace with her past. \u00a0The same actors reappeared in acts two and three, representing people in Marlene\u2019s real life. \u00a0The versatility of the actors were an especial boon to the production. \u00a0Props go to Thompson for an effortless transition and continuity between her roles. Cassie L. Fliegel \u201906 as Marlene was solid but uninteresting in the first act, but Fliegel\u2019s subtlety turned out to be a true plus. \u00a0The contrast between the successful career woman and the struggling inner self was all the more poignant as Fliegal\u2019s acting progressively expanded in depth.</span></p> <p><span>Imaginative sets added polish to a well-thought-out performance. \u00a0Bravo to cast and crew for a job smartly done with an extremely challenging production.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Crimson arts reviewer Mildred Yuan can be reached at yuan@fas.harvard.edu.</span></p>"}

This was always an arranged marriage\u2014between the desperate senator looking for an angle and the desperate Democrats looking for a winner. And like most arranged marriages, this one\u2019s not going very well.</span></p> <p><span>Yes, it\u2019s not going very well despite a new Newsweek poll, out today, that shows a week of horrible news on Iraq taking its toll: Bush dropped, and is now at a statistical tie with Kerry. Shifting our eyes away from the horserace (which, by the way, has shown Bush ahead four out of the last five weeks), we can see that deeper changes have affected the electorate.</span></p> <p><span>According to last week\u2019s CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll, 36 percent of voters now view Kerry unfavorably (up from 26 percent five weeks ago), and the number who find him \u201ctoo liberal\u201d jumped from 29 percent to 41 percent. Newsweek also found that, for the first time, a majority of voters believes Kerry will raise their taxes.</span></p> <p><span>Why have millions of voters\u2014a majority of whom think America is on the wrong track\u2014turned tough on the Candidate of Change? Because in the face of a very expected Republican attack campaign, Kerry quickly, clearly, aggressively\u2026disappeared from television.</span></p> <p><span>Which brings us back to the question of trust.</span></p> <p><span>Kerry ran ads in Iowa and New Hampshire that said \u201cthe only way we\u2019re going to beat George Bush is with John Kerry\u2019s leadership and experience.\u201d But he got a lot more explicit than that. Kerry looked into the camera and made a pledge: \u201cI promise to take the fight to George Bush every single day.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But since becoming the all-but-official nominee on March 2, Kerry has broken his promise. As the negative ads began, Kerry has done little more than receive the fight from George Bush every single day.</span></p> <p><span>According to newly disclosed Federal Election Commission reports, the Bush campaign has spent almost $40 million in a single month, across 18 battleground states, spreading three negative messages about Kerry: First, that he will raise taxes. Second, that he will weaken America\u2019s war on terror. Third, that he flip-flops on the issues.</span></p> <p><span>Kerry\u2019s television response? A sparsely broadcast, though enormously heartening, no-he-won\u2019t on the first. And absolute silence on the second and third. The candidate who promised a relentless fight has thus far failed to broadcast any alternative to Bush\u2019s attacks. Yes, Moveon.org and The Media Fund\u2014pro-Democratic groups airing anti-Bush commercials\u2014serve a valuable purpose. But by law, they are forbidden from coordinating with the Kerry campaign and seem unable to directly challenge Bush\u2019s offensive.</span></p> <p><span>Michael Dukakis proved the point: Ignoring an attack sends the public a powerful message\u2014that the attack is true.</span></p> <p><span>Abandoning the promise that got him nominated, a passive and cocky John Kerry is getting defined by George Bush. A recent New York Times/CBS News poll shows that six out of ten voters now thinks Kerry only says what people want to hear.</span></p> <p><span>I wonder how many Democratic primary voters feel the same way.</span></p> <p><span><i>Brian M.

{"title": "Parts of Speech | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Politics is always novelistic, but the last week\u2019s worth of news had me flashing back to high school English class. The latest twists in the swiftly unraveling plot of our government\u2019s past and present security policy, led by the climactic testimony of Condoleezza Rice before the Sept. 11 Commission last week, make the newspaper look like a bank of examples to supplement the review glossary for the AP test. You could tick off the literary terms embodied in the headlines, one by one, as if it had been laid out this way on purpose:</span></p> <p><span><b>Irony:</b> Right now we\u2019re living through an extraordinary confluence of dramatic, situational and verbal irony rolled into one. A leading campaign story over the weekend was that Americans are unusually divided in their opinions of President Bush and where the country is headed. In Iraq, meanwhile, the unthinkable happened: Sunnis and Shiites, having been at each others\u2019 throats for centuries, appear to be cooperating in a popular uprising against the American presence. In a moment that belongs next to textbook entries on literary irony, the president has partly made good on his promise to be \u201cA uniter, not a divider.\u201d He may have divided America, but he is uniting Iraq.</span></p> <p><span><b>Juxtaposition:</b> A hallmark of modern art, postmodern literature and the Simpsons, the juxtaposition of unrelated or contradictory elements can be very effective in producing humor or horror. Cable TV is rich with both, thanks to the now-inescapable phenomenon of crowding the screen with as many visual artifacts and moving pieces of text as possible. Resulting juxtapositions have included a split-screen on CNN with a live broadcast of Cheney praising America\u2019s operation in Iraq in a prepared speech while, a thousand miles away and a few inches over on the screen, the aftermath of a massive car bombing in Baghdad flared and billowed in the night. Somewhat less dramatically, a news ticker gave a running account of last week\u2019s sudden anti-American uprising in Iraq, while Dr. Rice testified to the Sept. 11 Commission that our actions in Iraq were removing a source of \u201cviolence and fear and instability in the world\u2019s most dangerous region.\u201d Then, on Sunday, Chris Matthews showed on his program footage of President Bush at his ranch on Aug. 7, 2001. Leaning on the steering wheel of his golf cart, the president mused on national security priorities, talking about what a threat Saddam Hussein was but making no mention of bin Laden. The clip was part of a news story about the release of Bush\u2019s security briefing from Aug. 6, entitled \u201cBin Laden determined to Attack Inside the United States.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><b>Understatement:</b> A good author knows how the right kind of understatement can actually emphasize the understated point. Dr. Rice unintentionally offered a fine example when, in private testimony to the Sept. 11 Commission, she reportedly asked to revise her previous statement that \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody could have predicted that these people would take an airplane and slam it into the World Trade Center, that they would try to use an airplane as a missile\u2014a hijacked airplane as a missile.\u201d That pillar of her case that nothing could have been done better by the administration soon crumbled, after critics pointed out that a madman tried to fly a plane into the White House in 1994, that the Pentagon had set up an entire study on the possibility of terrorists using planes as bombs and finally that the Bush administration itself had been told in 2001 that terrorists had considered using planes as missiles. Now, she wants to revise it. It\u2019s a bit like Bill Clinton, after the blue dress came back with his DNA, wanting to \u201crevise\u201d his claim that he \u201cdid not have sexual relations with that woman.\u201d The understatement (\u201creverse,\u201d \u201cdisavow\u201d or \u201capologize for\u201d would all have been more logical verbs for this one) called attention to the fact that she and the president still have yet to admit having failed in any way. This is all the more glaring (by juxtaposition, as it happens) given the recent sight of her former colleague Dick Clarke, apologizing explicitly for the government\u2019s failure to prevent Sept. 11. Clarke\u2019s ignored warnings to the administration about the possible use of airplanes as weapons, incidentally, are a glaring signal of the dishonesty of Rice\u2019s claim.</span></p> <p><span>Those are just a few favorite examples, but the correspondences continue. With a little punctuation and some conjunctions, one high school\u2019s AP review list of allusions and terms turns into a weird poem on current events: \u201cA dramatic monologue: a soliloquy. Subjectivity, objectivity, and euphemism. Conceit: hyperbole. Inversion and irony\u2026 the tragic flaw. Protagonist or antihero? Point of view! Epic elements, oxymoronic furies, paradoxical fates. Icarus and Daedalus, or Tantalus and Sisyphus? Or Pandora?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>All this suggests a useful approach for voters trying to see through the fog of war and decide whom to believe: close reading. Once students have internalized the vocabulary of literary analysis, a good teacher has them practicing careful reading of a few lines, in order to find what\u2019s in them and what\u2019s really between them. It\u2019s a life skill as well as a literary one, since everywhere a lot hangs on a word. When the White House says something untrue\u2014for example, the bogus threat to Air Force One on Sept. 11 cited to justify President Bush\u2019s crisscrossing the country that day, or the nonexistent International Atomic Energy Agency report that, Bush claimed, said Iraq was six months away from the Bomb\u2014it\u2019s important to discover the right word to describe it. Did Bush exaggerate something true or did he just make it up? Did the White House purposely deceive us about Air Force One, or get confused? Did Rice assume Clarke would not come forward and feel free to lie about the administration\u2019s awareness of the airliner threat? Or is it true that, as she now claims, she \u201cmisspoke?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>This week, the press will be doing a lot of close reading of the president\u2019s Aug. 6 intelligence briefing, which includes a warning about \u201cpatterns of suspicious activity consistent with preparations for hijackings.\u2026\u201d The AP English definition of tragedy\u2014something that begins in prosperity and ends in adversity\u2014will come in handy when readers are deciding whether to laugh or to cry.</span></p> <p><span><i>Peter P.M.

With all the seriousness of President Bush trying to name the capital of Afghanistan, it dawned on me that, in the next few minutes, I would have to make a painful decision. Watch through the end of Law &amp; Order, or switch channels and see Amanda Peet on The Tonight Show?</span></p> <p><span>Under normal circumstances, such a decision would not have seemed so pressure-packed, borderline life-altering. But in the context of my quiet week at home\u2014with just one job interview to preoccupy my thoughts and time\u2014choosing whether to see another TV criminal get convicted or the engaging Peet fend off Jay Leno\u2019s leering advances suddenly became a daunting task.</span></p> <p><span>More was at stake than was visible to my parents, who by the end of the week were wondering whether there\u2019s a TV watchers\u2019 equivalent of the Betty Ford Clinic. Even I was a little concerned by how seriously (mock-seriously, I told myself) I was taking my TV viewing. But then the real issue became clear:  not having my own TV at school, I was simply trying to make the most out of my limited time with access to cable and not much else to do. Based on what I\u2019ve heard from other Harvard students who went home for spring break, I was hardly alone last week in my mostly pleasurable, occasionally stressful TV binge.</span></p> <p><span>Two types of students inhabit this campus: those who regularly watch TV, and those who\u2014you guessed it\u2014don\u2019t. I am, regrettably, a member of the latter category, staking out house common rooms or making arrangements in advance when there\u2019s something in particular I want to watch in a friend\u2019s room. I\u2019m joined in my TV-lessness by a large sector of the Harvard population, a group which knows not what it\u2019s missing.</span></p> <p><span>At a university that prides itself on the living standards of its students, it is remarkable that so many of us are deprived of TV, a truly elemental part of the American lifestyle. The situation is not the university\u2019s fault\u2014no one has the \u201cright\u201d to a TV\u2014and in fact it is students who are depriving themselves of the simple pleasures of the sitcom and the important if incomplete information disseminated nightly through the TV news filter. This is not only a problem because it creates crises like the one I experienced over spring break, but more importantly because it makes the Harvard bubble even more impenetrable and robs students of an invaluable setting in which to have some casual fun and take a bit of time to relax.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard students, as one is reminded from time to time, are supposed to be eternally studious and hard-working. Most people got here by working like dogs, and stopping after getting admitted hardly seems like a good idea given the new environment. Harvard culture is about always being busy, or at least appearing to be busy, in order to demonstrate the ambition, focus and other qualities that we are all supposed to personify and hold so dear.</span></p> <p><span>There\u2019s always meant to be another exam or extracurricular activity to demand our attention, and admitting that we regularly watch Survivor or The Sharon Osbourne Show shatters that illusion. It\u2019s allegedly a disservice to ourselves for not working harder, as well an affront to all those other students who might\u2014call a doctor\u2014start to wonder whether they\u2019re structuring their lives correctly.</span></p> <p><span>Second, the widespread campus aversion to TV seems illogical and shortsighted at a school where so many students fancy themselves future leaders in their field. By and large, those fields will not be anywhere near Cambridge, so it\u2019s not a bad idea to keep up with what\u2019s taking place outside our gated confines. The culture and society that so many of us study exists outside course readings and the Internet, yet too many students willfully shut themselves off from what their future employers, spouses and peers observe on television and think about. TV remains the dominant shaper and purveyor of our culture, and it\u2019s not a good idea to have a black hole where a sense of that culture should be.</span></p> <p><span>And, as I pleasantly re-learned over spring break, TV isn\u2019t the intellect-dissolver or morality-debaser that it is so often criticized as being. There happens to be a lot of clever and interesting stuff out there (Amanda Peet on Leno, for example), and even the bad programs are usually worth figuring out and dismissing.</span></p> <p><span>Good or bad, however, TV can always be counted on to provide an a worldview outside Harvard or a little escapist fun, each of which, even my parents would agree, is worth at least a bit of our time.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Nathan K.

{"title": "How to Cure the Blockbuster Syndrome | Arts | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>BEN SOSKIN: Well, we\u2019re slowly inching through the waste of time that is the spring movie season\u2014meaning that we\u2019re closing in on the waste of time that is the summer movie season. So, since summer\u2019s on the way, I thought we might spin out some thoughts on the state of the summer action blockbuster.</span></p> <p><span>We\u2019ve been moving for several years towards a state of affairs where studios, wary of risking big money by backing an unproven property, instead greenlight sequel after sequel to their few profitable action franchises. Last year\u2019s summer slate was the worst example yet of this trend, featuring sequels to <i>The Matrix</i>, <i>Charlie\u2019s Angels</i>, <i>X-Men</i>, <i>Terminator</i>, <i>Bad Boys</i>, <i>The Fast and the Furious</i> and <i>Tomb Raider</i>\u2014a bunch of exercises in money-burning, most of them roundly reviled by critics and many lapsing from the public consciousness even before they came out on DVD (the only impact that the second <i>Charlie\u2019s Angels</i> movie made was to remind us that Demi Moore once had a career).</span></p> <p><span>I couldn\u2019t bring myself to see any of this crap crop last summer\u2014after wasting ten bucks on <i>The Matrix Reloaded</i>, I confined my summer movie-watching to what I could get from Netflix and the local library; I got up to speed on Cronenberg and Polanski and saw a bunch of other classics that I hadn\u2019t caught yet. The only ticket I bought for the rest of the summer was to see <i>28 Days Later</i> (which I enjoyed a lot\u2014I\u2019m a sucker for evocative apocalypse movies).</span></p> <p><span>Whether it\u2019s because of the underperformance of a number of last summer\u2019s sequels, or because the studios are now short on franchises to exploit, it looks like this summer\u2019s crop of bad action films will feature slightly fewer movies with a \u201cII\u201d or \u201cIII\u201d after their names. There are new installments of <i>Spider-Man</i>, <i>Harry Potter</i>, <i>Shrek</i> and <i>The Bourne Identity</i> on the way (not to mention <i>Alien vs. Predator</i>, which makes me wonder when Alien and Predator will face off against Jason and Freddy), but there is also a lot of big-budget product which should be perfectly craptacular despite not being a sequel to anything\u2014among them <i>Catwoman</i>, <i>I</i>, <i>Robot</i>, <i>Van Helsing</i>, <i>The Day After Tomorrow</i> (my evocative apocalypse bias notwithstanding), <i>King Arthur</i> and <i>Troy</i>.</span></p> <p><span>Is there a chance that some of those movies will be good? Sure, but action-y blockbusters as a group are so creatively and intellectually bankrupt that I don\u2019t see any need to cut them any slack; we should consider them bad until proven good. And even at their best, such movies can\u2019t match the worth of good dramas or intelligent, socially relevant comedies; I love <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i> and <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i> as much as the next movie man, but as creative as they are, they\u2019re not much more than eye-candy adventures to eat popcorn by. It\u2019s a miracle that America\u2019s film critics aren\u2019t so battered by high-decibel Bruckheimer clones by summer\u2019s end that they lose all objectivity and shower kisses on the dumb, earnest Oscar bait of early fall.</span></p> <p><span>Any interest in defending the big-budget summer shoot-em-ups? Are these dynamite-filled popcorn commercials worth the time that we spend watching them? Are they sufficiently transporting to give our imaginations a productive workout? Or would we be better off Netflixing our way through the season\u2019s multiplex doldrums?</span></p> <p><span>BEN B. CHUNG: You won\u2019t hear too much dissent from me on this topic, Mr. Soskin. The reign of the summer blockbuster is an ugly, brutal one; long before the Bush administration made it a way of life, studios have relied on and thereby perpetuated a deep, long-standing ignorance within the American people. Far too many individuals have locked themselves into the mindset that film simply cannot exist as an art form comparable to its centuries-old companions in theater, painting and music. I\u2019ve bore many an unhealthy grudge against friends unwilling to accept movies as anything beyond mere entertainment. The most unfortunate aspect of the whole situation is that the less people expect from their weekly excursions to the multiplex, the less they\u2019re delivered. And voila: the monsters are unleashed.</span></p> <p><span>Blame it on Spielberg and Lucas. The momentous rise of <i>Jaws</i> in 1975 and the astonishing popularity of <i>Star Wars</i> two year later are now widely recognized as gilded nooses - pinnacles of plebeian filmmaking that regrettably turned studio heads away from craftsmanship towards greener pastures. Marketing budgets ballooned to rival production costs, strategic release date positioning during the summer months became essential and, as you mentioned, inexplicable sequels popped up left and right. Studios now saw it fit to accompany <i>Psycho</i> with three full remakes, investing in tag lines like, \u201cNorman Bates is back to normal. But Mother\u2019s off her rocker again!\u201d</span></p> <p><span>At any rate, the summer\u2019s genre-bound orgies of blood and guns are here to stay, and rather than upset the balance, the goal of studios should be to enrich what\u2019s already available. It\u2019s plain wrong to claim that blockbusters need to exist as brainless, heartless machines in order to succeed. There have been a number of superior action movies offered in recent years, with equal shares of proficient filmmaking and mass appeal. <i>Dirty Pretty Things</i>, <i>Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World</i>, <i>City of God</i> and <i>Kill Bill: Volume One</i> all have the key ingredients of a successful summer blockbuster, but all were judged too intelligent to take on such a heavy load, and were thus advertised as magnets for awards rather than audiences. Given the sort of massive promotional push reserved for bigger, dumber movies, these films could easily have quadrupled their final grosses.</span></p> <p><span>As for that other sacred summer institution, the low-brow extended-play sitcom, I will admit I have a special place in my heart for them. I certainly cherish smarter, subtler comedic works more than any gross-out bodily fluid showcase, but there\u2019s something to be said for a movie (<i>Old School</i> and <i>Meet the Parents</i> immediately come to mind) that can make me laugh continuously for an hour and a half. That is an accomplishment that is rarely replicated in the independent film community and holds merit far beyond the average half-assed comic-book adaptation.</span></p> <p><span>So what is to be done with Tinseltown\u2019s unfortunate state of affairs? Well, studios can start by moving away from its reliance on test audiences. Producers remain convinced that test screenings are the best way to gauge a film\u2019s potential success and target audience. This is largely ineffective. Paramount Pictures must somehow have found the only ten people on the planet likely to enjoy Twisted, branded them a focus group and gave the movie a green light. The movie failed to recoup even half its budget. Most of the movies in this week\u2019s top ten will fail to make their studios a profit until every last cent has been squeezed out of merchandising and television broadcast rights. With such an inefficient business model, it\u2019s amazing that the system remains unyielding.</span></p> <p><span>Any better ideas about how to reform the Blockbuster Syndrome? The post-Oscars months will always be lost to us, but maybe we can still take back the summers for the forces of good and out of the hands of Michael Bay.</span></p> <p><span>Oh, and in rebuttal to your statement about undeserved post-summer doldrums acclaim, I present to you Entertainment Weekly\u2019s largely respectable critic Lisa Schwarzbaum and her take on last year\u2019s rigid, bland-as-glue Seabiscuit: \u201cA rare pedigreed entrant in a summer of mules.\u201d It seems many critics (79 percent of them, according to rottentomatoes.com) are not as capable as you think of keeping their cool after a summer of roasted, bloated turkeys.</span></p> <p><span>BEN SOSKIN: You\u2019ve made a lot of great points, Mr. Chung. I think that there\u2019s a simple solution to the studios\u2019 overreliance on \u201csafe\u201d summer product, but it\u2019d be a tough solution to put into practice. Yes, Hollywood needs talented studio heads who will develop compelling ideas, and yes, they need to give directors the creative control they deserve. But, most importantly, the studios have to find better writers and better scripts.</span></p> <p><span>When Spielberg made <i>Raiders</i>, he proved that a blockbuster could be smart at the same time that it was thrilling, and Lucas proved the same when he made <i>Star Wars</i> and <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i>. But you\u2019re also right to blame them for the brainless excesses of today\u2019s summer scene\u2014not just as the fathers of the form, but on the basis of their own conduct since that time. Lucas\u2019 pointless return to the Star Wars franchise hasn\u2019t done much to dignify the season. Nor has Spielberg\u2019s spotty summer-film track record; if I were to wander the circles of Hell today, I\u2019d hope to find the suits who greenlit <i>Temple of Doom, Hook, The Lost World</i> and\u2014if there\u2019s any justice\u2014<i>Close Encounters</i>.</span></p> <p><span>Most of the time, it\u2019s the writer who makes a movie work. It\u2019s no surprise to me that the scripts to <i>Raiders</i> and <i>Empire</i> were both written by the same guy \u2014Lawrence Kasdan, the great wit behind <i>The Big Chill</i> and <i>Body Heat</i>. Does this portend great things for <i>Troy</i>, whose scribe David Benioff last wrote the compelling <i>25th Hour</i>? Probably not, if the preview\u2019s dialogue is any indication, but the important thing is that Benioff\u2019s working at Hollywood\u2019s heart, and that can only strengthen the system.</span></p> <p><span>The importance of quality writing may be why those gross-out comedies that you praise are sometimes the best product of the summer\u2014their imaginative excesses often require more creativity than one needs to write dialogue of the \u201cIt\u2019s gonna blow!\u201d variety. In the summer of \u201998, the only two movies that I paid to see twice were extreme comedies\u2014<i>There\u2019s Something About Mary</i> and <i>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</i> (which, admittedly, was an arthouse pukefest, rather than a mainstream one). And two of the best things about the summer of \u201999 were <i>American Pie</i> and the South Park movie.</span></p> <p><span>There isn\u2019t any shortage of intelligence in Hollywood; there\u2019s just a shortage of talent. Harvard\u2019s contribution to the summer scene has made that blindingly clear; we\u2019ve spawned the presumably intelligent writers and/or directors of <i>XXX</i>, <i>The Fast and the Furious</i>, <i>Wild Wild West</i>, <i>Terminator 3</i>, <i>Cats and Dogs</i>, <i>Bruce Almighty</i>, <i>Daddy Day Care</i>, <i>Blue Crush</i>, <i>Halloween: Resurrection</i> and more. Hollywood needs to weed out all of its dead wood, be they Harvard-trained or not, and find writers who can make some kind of memorable contribution to the medium. I wish we could just create twenty clones of William Goldman in his prime and thirty clones of Aaron Sorkin and then let the fifty of them write the entire summer crop, but life doesn\u2019t work that way.</span></p> <p><span>BEN B. CHUNG: Hey Ben. I fully agree that the writer is most often responsible for a film\u2019s quality. I find it almost impossible to enjoy a movie based on acting, cinematography or editing alone; alternately, a solid script can salvage even the most scantily budgeted, poorly acted production. As Sam Huntington might say, if films were chili, the cast and crew would simply be ingredients that could only enrich the essential tomato stock of the screenplay.</span></p> <p><span>So if writers are so crucial to a film\u2019s artistic success, and artistic success sometimes correlates with Oscars, which studios have a thing for, why aren\u2019t there nearly enough of them to go around? It\u2019s logical that for such an involved, multi-tiered process as direction, only a few individuals might rise above the fray and establish themselves in the critical limelight. But there are hundreds of decent novelists churning out product on a weekly basis, and yet consistently accomplished screenwriters are few and far between.</span></p> <p><span>I suspect that this is largely due to the marginalization of the screenwriter in Hollywood. Once in a blue moon, a writer will become something of a household name, but this usually requires them to either simultaneously dabble in direction or actually write themselves into their screenplays. Granted, writers are not particularly a most glamorous, lovable bunch, but Ang Lee, Ridley Scott and Steven Spielberg did not achieve superstar status with their chiseled jawbones.</span></p> <p><span>There\u2019s also the obvious consideration of the lack of artistic control often presented the writer. After the script is composed and put into production, the writer is rarely allowed to offer his or her input on a set. This might explain why writer-directors (David Gordon Green, Sofia Coppola and their ilk) often produce the most satisfying works; their undiluted vision makes for the most sound, unified art.</span></p> <p><span>Anyhow, I must admit I am fairly pleased that the sequel craze has been toned down for this summer, and though I\u2019m hardly looking forward to any of the epics Hollywood is attempting to ram down our throats this summer, I think we can all agree on one thing: the all-powerful hotness of Keira Knightley in a leather bondage outfit, sporting Celtic tattoos and one big-ass sword. Bring it on, Keira.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Ben Soskin can be reached at bsoskin@fas.harvard.edu.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Ben B.

Vittor", "body": "<p><span>Robert Novak, a columnist for the Chicago Sun-Times and co-host of CNN\u2019s Crossfire, disappointed audience members at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum last night by refusing to talk about his column that revealed the name of a CIA operative on weapons of mass destruction.</span></p> <p><span>On July 14, 2003, Novak named Valerie Plame, the wife of the retired diplomat Joseph C. Wilson, as a CIA operative\u2014an occupation she had kept secret\u2014in his Chicago Sun-Times column.</span></p> <p><span>Novak opened his talk entitled, \u201cThe Washington Overview,\u201d with a list of five questions he is frequently asked. At the top of the list comes the question of who were the two senior administration officials who leaked Plame\u2019s name.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI have been told by my attorneys not to answer that question or any other questions about the CIA,\u201d Novak said.</span></p> <p><span>Many critics have claimed that the White House gave Plame\u2019s name to Novak in order to get back at Wilson, her husband, after Wilson criticized the Bush administration for invading Iraq.</span></p> <p><span>The CIA sent Wilson to Niger in February 2002 to investigate whether or not Iraq had purchased uranium with the intent to build weapons of mass destruction. After his trip, Wilson reported back to the White House that he doubted the veracity of reports that Iraq had purchased uranium from Niger.</span></p> <p><span>While Novak was reticent about his July column, he had plenty to say about the upcoming 2004 presidential election. He spent the majority of his 20-minute speech discussing what factors would ultimately determine the presidential winner, focusing on the economy and the war in Iraq.</span></p> <p><span>Novak, who has gained a reputation as a staunch conservative, criticized Democrats\u2019 focus on the budget deficit.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMost of all, [voters] are influenced by the economy,\u201d Novak said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t give a damn about the deficit.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Novak also argued that those with higher incomes of more than $50,000 usually vote Republican.</span></p> <p><span>One audience member challenged this assertion in a question and answered session after Novak\u2019s speech, pointing to the prevalence of stickers for Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass. on expensive automobiles in Massachusetts.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cYou certainly can\u2019t draw conclusions from the People\u2019s Republic of Massachusetts,\u201d Novak said.</span></p> <p><span>Novak did, however, see one issue that could potentially bring down the Bush administration in the upcoming election.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhat is the issue that can bring across the Democrats?\u201d Novak asked. \u201cThat is the war in Iraq.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Novak said that he disagreed with the Bush administration\u2019s decision to invade Iraq.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI have morphed in my life from a moderate Republican to a right-wing extremist, but I have never been for intervening around the world to make replicas of Iowa,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that is a practical ambition for the United States or the United States military.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Novak also made predictions about Democratic candidates for vice president. He ranked the question of whether or not Sen. Hillary R. Clinton, D-N.Y., would be the running mate of Kerry as one of the top five questions he is frequently asked.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cNot a chance,\u201d Novak said on the odds that Clinton would be selected as the vice presidential candidate. \u201cShe would be most desired by the Republicans because that would really guarantee a Republican win, but sometimes you don\u2019t get what you wish for.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In the question and answer session, Novak offered up another contender to be vice president.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think if you want somebody who is dedicated, diverse, and witty...that would be Al Sharpton,\u201d Novak joked.</span></p> <p><span>In his discussion about the presidential election, Novak also talked more generally about differences between the Democrats and Republicans, highlighting their conflicting views on government.  He supported the traditional Republican view that more government is part of the problem, not part of the solution.</span></p> <p><span>Novak told audience members that his two favorite presidents of the 20th century were Ronald Reagan and Calvin Coolidge\u2014both of whom took a hands-off approach to the Oval Office.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cNeither one of them could have ever been accused of being a workaholic,\u201d Novak said. \u201cI personally believe that a president has never hurt the country while making zzz\u2019s in the White House bedroom.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Novak also talked about his reputation in Washington, D.C., referring to himself as the city\u2019s \u201cprince of darkness.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIs the Washington news media really as liberal as it is made out to be?\u201d Novak asked. \u201cThat\u2019s like asking, \u2018Is Pope John Paul II really a Catholic?\u2019\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Near the end of last night\u2019s talk, one audience member attempted to probe Novak for more information regarding the sources who leaked Plame\u2019s name to him, but was immediately struck down.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI said I wouldn\u2019t answer any questions,\u201d Novak said. \u201cThis story is going to break some day, and I will answer all of your questions.\u201d</span></p>"}

{"title": "Fight Discrimination at All Costs | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>If the House of Representatives has its way, Harvard may soon face an important but difficult decision on its policy of barring the Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) program: make an exception in its long-standing anti-discrimination policy to allow the military to gain an official campus foothold, or lose heaps of federal funding. In this instance, although the cost to Harvard is potentially immense, the University has a responsibility to stand up for its principles. It must not be strong-armed by the federal government into providing for a blatantly discriminatory organization on campus.</span></p> <p><span>On March 30, the House of Representatives approved the ROTC and Military Recruiter Equal Access to Campus Act of 2004 by a 4-1 margin. If passed into law by the Senate, as some politicos have predicted it will be before the November election, the bill stands poised to require schools to let ROTC through their doors. As the bill\u2019s primary sponsor, Rep. Christopher Cox, R-CA, a former Faculty member of the Harvard Business School, has noted, it \u201cmight just as well be called the Harvard Act\u201d since most other schools have capitulated to ROTC or made clear their willingness to reject government funding if it comes to that. If Harvard refuses, the bill threatens to strip the University of all funding from the Departments of Homeland Security, Energy, Transportation and the Central Intelligence Agency. According to Kevin Casey, the University\u2019s Federal Relations chief, the cost would likely amount to over $400 million.</span></p> <p><span>In a blunt way, the act forces Harvard to face the practical reality of its policy barring ROTC. Since the bill is aimed squarely at Harvard\u2014seeking to inflict maximum economic consequences for its moral stance\u2014the real question becomes, how much does Harvard value its policy of nondiscrimination? When the Department of Defense, brandishing the Solomon Amendment, threatened to withhold federal grants unless Harvard Law School allowed military recruiters on campus, the University capitulated and gave the recruiters an exemption from the non-discrimination clause. It should not do so again. If the Senate approves the bill and President Bush signs it into law, Harvard must not hesitate to take a moral, if economically painful stance. By rejecting government money, Harvard makes a bold assertion to stand by its principles, and its actions speak far louder than words.</span></p> <p><span>It is important to recognize that Harvard\u2019s stance on the issue stems from a desire to improve the military, not to deny its worth; it is a matter of holding all student groups accountable to the same principled standards. University President Lawrence H. Summers has rightly stressed the need for the University to support America\u2019s public servants. We too, who firmly believe the University should stand by its nondiscrimination policy, have no desire to disparage the brave efforts made by U.S. soldiers worldwide. We praise the work of the ROTC Association, the nondiscriminatory and College-approved student group, which educates and trains students in the value of public service. And, moreover, we support those Harvard students who make the regular trip to MIT to participate in ROTC there; their determination and objectives are admirable.</span></p> <p><span>But let there be no mistake: The entity responsible for making those students\u2019 lives more difficult is not Harvard but the federal government itself. Congress has repeatedly refused to take the opportunity to repeal its disgraceful \u201cDon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy, which has been in effect ever since Congress took the unusual step of dictating military policy to the Pentagon at the start of President Clinton\u2019s term. Currently, should a ROTC cadet\u2019s homosexual identity be revealed, he or she stands to lose a ROTC scholarship sometimes worth over $100,000. If the federal government were to rescind its policy, which is offensive and wrong, it would remove an unfortunate stain from ROTC\u2019s image, and the group would very quickly gain official access to campus once again.</span></p> <p><span>It\u2019s disappointing that Harvard and the federal government have come to this impasse, but it is even more shameful that Congress is attempting to blackmail the University. Harvard should stay the course with its policy on ROTC and attempt through all the means at its disposal to reverse the federal government\u2019s mistaken course. If it does not, Harvard will end up facing an undesirable, if apparent, choice of surrendering a vast wealth of federal funds or its principles.</span></p>"}

Kennedy Jr. Forum yesterday.</span></p> <p><span>Mehlman said that Bush recognizes that containment is \u201cinsufficient to protect America in a post 9/11 world as we\u2019re facing international terrorism.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Although Kerry has supported greater international and United Nations involvement in Iraq, Mehlman yesterday said that \u201cmultilateral means are a means, not an end.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cDemocracy and stability in Iraq is the end, and we will do whatever we have to to accomplish that end, but we\u2019re not going to sacrifice the end for the means,\u201d said Mehlman.</span></p> <p><span>He said the election would feature a \u201chuge debate on the most important issue a nation can face, which is how do you maintain and protect your peace.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Harvard Republican Club president Mark T. Silvestri \u201905 said the key part of Mehlman\u2019s address was the foreign policy. \u201c[The U.S.] needs to proactively connect the dots so we prevent another attack within this country, \u201c Silvestri said.</span></p> <p><span>The 2004 election, Mehlman said, will hinge on the economy and foreign policy.</span></p> <p><span>He accused Bush\u2019s presumptive Democratic challenger, Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., of supporting economic policies that will make it \u201cmore expensive to hire workers\u201d in the United States.</span></p> <p><span>He said Bush supports tax cuts and deregulation and, in response to a question from Institute of Politics Director Daniel R. Glickman, said that Bush has plans to cut the U.S. deficit in half over the next five years.Mehlman was introduced by Matt Scogin, a masters in public policy student at the Kennedy School of Government who noted that Republicans are \u201csometimes vastly outnumbered\u201d at Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>Just after the introduction but before Mehlman began speaking, several members protested his appearance at the Forum by shouting and hanging a banner from the second level of the Forum.</span></p> <p><span>Before guards escorted the protestors out of sthe Forum, they threw confetti from the balcony.</span></p> <p><span>Glickman, who said the protest was unusual at the Forum, added that he didn\u2019t think it was very effective.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe irony is that protestors like this tend to hurt their cause,\u201d Glickman said.  \u201cI think it actually helped [Mehlman].\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Mehlman said in the speech that in the 2004 election in particular, the way people get information will play a crucial role.</span></p> <p><span>Mehlman said that candidates\u2019 efforts at communicating their messages effectively will depend on their abilities \u201cto have synergy\u201d between different forms of media, such as print and the Internet.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe wealth of information creates a poverty of attention,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>In response to a question from Nicholas F.B. Smyth \u201905\u2014who was sporting a shirt supporting Kerry\u2019s candidacy\u2014on renouncing the use of \u201cwedge\u201d issues such as race and gay marriage, Mehlman said that he did not consider gay marriage a wedge issue but rather one of great importance to the American people.</span></p> <p><span>Andy J. Frank \u201905, the president of the Harvard College Democrats, said after the speech that he disagreed with Mehlman\u2019s description of the gay marriage question.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cGay marriage is a huge wedge issue and pretending that it is not an issue is simply not true,\u201d Frank said.</span></p> <p><span>But Scogin suggested that Bush should use the election as an opportunity to initiate a public discussion on gay marriage.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think part of the outrage with what happened in Massachusetts with the Supreme Court decision was that it occurred before a public dialogue could take place,\u201d he said. \u201cSo with the campaign obviously Kerry and Bush have different views on gay marriage and I think the upcoming election will provide a good platform by which to debate those differences.\u201d</span></p>"}
{"title": "New in Film | Arts | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Scoop A. Wasserstein", "body": "<p><span>Directed by Lars von Trier</span></p> <p><span>Lions Gate Entertainment</span></p> <p><span>Much has been made of the supposedly anti-American attitude behind <i>Dogville</i>, Danish director Lars von Trier\u2019s (<i>Dancer in the Dark, Breaking the Waves</i>) latest portrait of a woman wronged by society.</span></p> <p><span>Ever since its unveiling at the Cannes Film Festival (where it lost out to Gus Van Sant\u2019s <i>Elephant</i> for the Palme d\u2019Or) and exhibition in Europe, domestic critics have attacked the film on three counts. They decry its depiction of an imaginary Depression-era small town for its brutality, its director for presuming to understand our country without ever having set foot in it, and its callous end-credits, which set Walker Evans\u2019 famous photographs of impoverished southerners to the strains of David Bowie\u2019s \u201cYoung Americans\u201d. One called the film\u2019s message \u201cTaliban thinking\u201d to von Trier\u2019s face, while another wrote that \u201cfor any American, seeing such nakedly hateful sentiments expressed by a filmmaker such as von Trier should be as terrifying as a replay of those jets plowing into the World Trade Center.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Even as the action unfolds in a Rocky Mountains village of von Trier\u2019s invention, the film\u2019s statement about the nature of humanity is clearly far more general than a shrill denunciation of the American dream or George W. Bush\u2019s administration. Like many a great dramatic work\u2014think Richard III or Oedipus Rex\u2014the setting is merely a backdrop for the message. A misanthropic deconstruction of Thornton Wilder\u2019s 1938 play Our Town, <i>Dogville</i> draws very much on theatrical (and literary) conventions in order to depart from more traditional cinematic renderings and privilege the message over the medium.</span></p> <p><span><i>Dogville</i> springs not only from von Trier\u2019s imagination, but from our own\u2014like in Wilder\u2019s town, there are no sets. The action was filmed on a Swedish soundstage, the floor marked with white outlines where houses, bushes, and even a dog should be, abstractions the characters accept as concrete structures but which the audience must build in their own minds.</span></p> <p><span>What convinces us to buy into this charade?  That the ensemble cast performs every bit as well as its marquee actors.  Nicole Kidman shows us why she should only act in art films; Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, Lauren Bacall, Patricia Clarkson, and Ben Gazzara all live up to their names; and Paul Bettany, an upstart compared to his castmates, shockingly manages to upstage the veterans with a performance that should make his career.</span></p> <p><span>With a running time of about three hours, one might expect difficulty briefly summarizing the film\u2019s plot. Grace (Nicole Kidman) arrives in Dogville on the run from some unnamed danger. The villagers take her in and then turn on her. The ending shocks and leaves the audience full of questions, which von Trier presumably will answer in the rest of the trilogy, albeit without Kidman as the lead.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Alexandra B. Moss</span></p> <p><span><b>The Prince and Me</b></span></p> <p><span>Directed by Martha Coolidge</span></p> <p><span>Paramount Pictures</span></p> <p><span>Lil\u2019 Kim once advised, \u201cWhat do you do when your man is untrue? You cut the sucker off and find someone new.\u201d If only Julia Stiles\u2019 Paige had honored Kim\u2019s fine words, in the new film <i>The Prince and Me</i>, she wouldn\u2019t have to undergo the central trial of deciding whether to become the Queen of Denmark or pursue her ambition of becoming a Doctor in Third World Countries.</span></p> <p><span>How did she get into this oh-so-terrible position, you ask? Well, Edward, the Crown Prince of Denmark (played by undeniably handsome unknown Luke Mably) has a Prince William-esque reputation for carousing and\u2014evil-of-evils\u2014drag racing. These habits\u2014in this supposedly modern fairy tale\u2014are all too often splashed across the front page of Denmark\u2019s tabloids, earning him continual, serene, slaps on the wrist by his regal parents.</span></p> <p><span>The royals are eternally frustrated at Edwards\u2019 penchant for public PG-rated shenanigans instead of focusing on learning his kingly duties. Not to worry, as the King and Queen are portrayed by esteemed Brits James Fox and Miranda Richardson in a fashion that revisits the Golden Age of Victorian unemotional hypocrisy, thereby making sure the stakes are never raised too high.</span></p> <p><span>Edward\u2019s reacts to this subdued pressure by deciding to enroll at the University of Wisconsin. How did he decide upon this institution? While complaining about the devastating pressure he is under to care about his future as a Prince, he catches an ad for Girls Gone Wild on TV, which features girls from the University of Wisconsin. Soon he is underway to Wisconsin to become someone new, along with a little help from Soren, the butler assigned by Her Majesty to help out Eddie, as he now insists on being called. Soren, played by British comedian Ben Miller steals every scene he\u2019s in, as the valet learning to adjust to college life. He creates a real character within this fairy stage, who isn\u2019t quite sure what to do now that his duties aren\u2019t as rigid as they once were. It is a generous performance that gives Mably a chance to seem like he has personality and charm, simply because he shares a room with Soren. The purpose of the character goes beyond his help to the other actors, however. Soren\u2019s relatable comprehension of the ridiculousness of the whole fairy tale situation allows the audience to recognize it and move beyond it. Too often romantic comedies are bogged down by their farcical nature, but in <i>Prince and Me</i>, I was able to move beyond the realization of its stupidity to enjoy its simple sweetness.</span></p> <p><span>One of the more interesting aspects of the story for movie buffs is Stiles\u2019 character\u2019s hatred of Shakespeare. She is an inveterate math and science geek who is unable to pass the school\u2019s Shakespeare requirement, and turns to well-schooled Eddie for help. For movie dorks like myself, this is ironic because Stiles got her start acting in Shakespearean adaptations like 10 Things I Hate About You (aka The Taming of the Shrew), Michael Almereyda\u2019s adaptation of Hamlet and Tim Blake Nelson\u2019s O, a high school version of Othello. Such slight touches of wit made this fairy tale viable, but ultimately forgettable date material.</span></p>"}

The extra sonic dimension feels more like revelation than heresy; the ease with which Clapton and his band introduce these new layers testifies to the oceanic depth of the songs.\u00a0From the slow and dirty grind of \u201cMilkcow\u2019s Calf Blues\u201d to the exhilarating ragtime bounce of \u201cThey\u2019re Red Hot,\u201d in which Preston\u2019s swaggering piano truly shines, Clapton\u2019s interpretations are uniformly satisfying.

An altogether pleasurable gateway into the world of the blues</span></p> <p><span>Various Artists</span></p> <p><span>Kill Bill, Vol. 2 Original Soundtrack</span></p> <p><span>(A Band Apart/Maverick)</span></p> <p><span>Quentin Tarantino continues his found-art odyssey through the fringes of culture on the soundtrack to Kill Bill Vol. 2, coming up with yet another bounty of oddities and forgotten \u201cclassics.\u201d But, though providing an intriguing and original listen, this installment lacks the immediacy and sparkle of its predecessor.</span></p> <p><span>As a hedge, I will mention that I have not yet seen the film, which undoubtedly impairs my appreciation of the soundtrack. Perhaps this makes it unfair for me to judge this album, but the fact remains that past Tarantino soundtracks have been excellent to begin with: Association with their respective films has made them beatific.</span></p> <p><span>Which is not to say that there is not some excellent music on this disc. Ennio Morricone, whose influence was all over the last soundtrack, emerges from the shadows here to contribute three spaghetti-western suspense pieces. Malcolm McLaren turns in an eerie trip-hop remake of the Zombies\u2019 \u201cShe\u2019s Not There\u201d retitled \u201cAbout Her.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>On \u201cUrami Bushi,\u201d Meiko Kaji reappears with another hazy torch song in the spirit of her track on the last album, \u201cThe Flower of Carnage.\u201d The combination of this track with Shivaree\u2019s gorgeous \u201cGoodnight Moon\u201d ensures that Nancy Sinatra is felt if not heard this time around.</span></p> <p><span>Towering over the rest of the album, though, is the latter-day Johnny Cash rendition of \u201cA Satisfied Mind.\u201d The song\u2019s gravelly sincerity may seem a little out of place among the ironic kitsch of the rest of the album, but let\u2019s not forget that Cash shot a man in Reno just to watch him die long before the Bride even knew the meaning of the word \u201cdismemberment.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Lou Reed</span></p> <p><span>Animal Serenade</span></p> <p><span>(Reprise)</span></p> <p><span>Lou Reed\u2019s new live album opens with three casually strummed chords from \u201cSweet Jane\u201d and a message to young bands: \u201cI thought I would explain to you how you make a career out of three chords.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>He\u2019s right. It could be a more interesting version of any modern emo song. Reed then plays all four bars of the riff from \u201cSweet Jane\u201d and notes that, \u201cas in most things in life, it\u2019s that little hop at the end.\u201d And with that, we\u2019re in Lou Reed\u2019s special world, where there will always be that little hop that changed modern rock forever\u2014the astonishing \u201960s and \u201970s rock group the Velvet Underground. Although their group work guaranteed Reed a place in musical history, much of his solo work has been hit-or-miss.</span></p> <p><span>With Animal Serenade, Reed makes peace with his legacy, bringing together the best of his solo career with some of his VU classics to make an entirely unique live album, stripped of the production obstructions that kept the listener away from his songs\u2019 raw power.</span></p> <p><span>Even \u201cThe Raven,\u201d taken from Reed\u2019s badly- reviewed musical celebration of the Edgar Allan Poe work, which is read in Reed\u2019s burnt-out but occasionally excitable drone, creates a palpable fear of the unknown and finds the undercurrent of sadness to make the rendition close to unforgettable.</span></p> <p><span>There are flaws on the album\u2014some great songs are left out and the back-up band doesn\u2019t match Reed\u2019s genius\u2014but there is an amazing sense of freshness and timelessness to each tune. Even the often-heard VU pieces offer something different at this point in Reed\u2019s life. In every piece, there is something that hits you, something beautiful, right where the memories lie</span></p> <p><span>Pat McGee Band</span></p> <p><span>Save Me</span></p> <p><span>(Warner Bros.)</span></p> <p><span>Pat McGee Band leave their acoustic guitar and earthy, hand-percussion sound and go electric on their second major-label album release, Save Me.</span></p> <p><span>Often found years ago playing solo gigs in front of drunken college kids at Longwood College\u2019s campus in Virginia, Pat McGee is now working on establishing himself among prominent contemporary singer/songwriters. His band formed in early 1996 and has been touring since. From McGee\u2019s 1996 recording From the Wood, it was clear that McGee was an extremely talented young troubadour, blending folk influences from James Taylor and Paul Simon with his own acoustic rock sound and incredible vocal capabilities.</span></p> <p><span>After an original album like From the Wood, Save Me risks sounding overly-produced. Maybe mainstream pop is the sound he\u2019s going for. He is easily as talented as John Mayer, but has received probably less than one-tenth the recognition. But after hearing the album\u2019s first track, I wanted someone to save me from listening to the record label\u2019s popified Pat McGee, no longer the soulful songwriter from Virginia with a knack for writing a love song. Thankfully, the album gets better as McGee\u2019s original sound comes through on \u201cSet Me Free,\u201d which is catchy and creative enough to make you want to press repeat.</span></p> <p><span>Although a lot of effort was put into Pat McGee Band\u2019s latest, and they are struggling for much deserved acclaim, From the Wood, McGee\u2019s self-produced debut, is a much better investment</span></p>"}
{"title": "Embedded With the Embeds | Arts | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Simon W. Vozick-levinson", "body": "<p><span>Thirty-five years and a week after Timothy G. Carlson \u201971 brought his camera into an occupied University Hall, the snapshots he took there can be found in magazine archives or a skip-filled CD-ROM. Still, no number of scratches or fading decades can obscure the behind-the-scenes images of the moment the ivory tower became a battleground.</span></p> <p><span>In one mid-range photo, light streams through the elegant windows of the chamber in which the Faculty of Arts and Sciences meets periodically, though this is no normal Faculty gathering. We cannot see who presides over the forty or so radical students packing a corner of the room they have taken by force, but it is certainly not a dean. They wait eagerly and a little uneasily as several raise their hands, one standing tall, in a meeting Carlson now compares to the Paris Commune, \u201creinventing history from the moment.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Another of Carlson\u2019s shots has only two living figures, dancing awkwardly with two ghosts of Harvard\u2019s past: one student rests a jaunty hand on the bald pate of the Faculty Room\u2019s bust of Benjamin Franklin, while another\u2019s skull seems in the process of being tickled by the two-dimensional knuckles of the bygone Harvard don whose portrait hangs above him.</span></p> <p><span>Carlson took these pictures of his revolutionary classmates at the height of the College\u2019s April 1969 student takeover, when he and a handful of his photographic subjects were Crimson editors, right in the middle of the chaos they were reporting on. The images are full of the uncertain immediacy of that time, that tentatively-toed border between politics and personality, youthful rebellion and major social change, and they were enough to get the young photographer noticed.</span></p> <p><span>The snapshots Carlson took of not-so-civil disobedience ended up appearing first in the widely-read pages of Life Magazine, he says, and soon he was traveling to observe Palestinians in Lebanon as a freelance writer and photographer. With any luck, it seemed, Carlson stood on the brink of a successful career as an overseas photojournalist covering some of the most harrowing and important stories in the world.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt seemed like a natural progression,\u201d Carlson says now. \u201cPerhaps I felt untouchable.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>And then his course veered. Prevented by an unexpected illness from covering the 1974 conflict in Cyprus, Carlson found himself freelancing and taking quieter domestic assignments over the decades\u2014at a bureau of TV Guide or at the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner, which went out of business while he was writing for it. Through much of the 1990s Carlson covered endurance sports for publications like Triathlete magazine.</span></p> <p><span>A year ago, Carlson dropped his projects at Triathlete to go abroad again\u2014to Baghdad, where the United States was waging its most controversial war since the 1970s. There, in the weeks before a sign reading \u201cMission Accomplished\u201d was strung up behind President Bush on the USS Lincoln, Carlson conducted a series of meta-interviews on his own, speaking with journalists from a wide range of news organizations about the thrills and trials, dangers and dilemmas of reporting live on the war.</span></p> <p><span>Carlson estimates that the resulting oral history\u2014<i>Embedded: The Media at War in Iraq</i>\u2014has sold more than 10,000 copies since its publication in September, winning reviews in The New York Times, the Washington Post and other high-profile venues. (The Times, generally favorable, said the book\u2019s \u201caccounts crackle with immediacy,\u201d while the Post spent most of its double-bill review riffing on a BBC editor\u2019s recently-published memoir.) <i>Embedded</i> has not been a blockbusting bestseller, but after bringing Carlson and co-author Bill Katovsky a Goldsmith Book Prize from the Kennedy School of Government\u2019s Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy last month, the book is poised to bring the man who once eluded police to get The Crimson and Life magazine photographs of a campus under siege back to the national stage.</span></p> <p><span><b>Portraits of the Artists in their Youths</b></span></p> <p><span>It cannot be easy to summon terms to match the places and times where the world\u2019s great ideological clashes have broken out into violent action. Carlson has faced that unenviable task in Cambridge and Baghdad, two instances that are only barely comparable, but which have led him to the same descriptive strategy of metaphor.</span></p> <p><span>In conversation, Carlson is very fond of employing slightly incongruous analogies to revive these vivid memories. The words of New York Times Baghdad Bureau Chief John F. Burns, whose meditation on the ethics of reporting from a totalitarian regime forms a centerpiece for Embedded, are compared to the works of Shakespeare and the Old Testament in the book. In person, Carlson reflects that Burns sounded a lot like Winston Churchill\u2014or was that Abraham Lincoln at Gettysburg? Newsweek reporter Scott Johnson\u2019s recollection of being shot at makes him, in Carlson\u2019s words, something like a latter-day Stephen Crane. An Al Jazeera correspondent with a fastidious dedication to fairness is, somewhat jarringly, just like Felix Unger of \u201cThe Odd Couple.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>There was a time when Carlson saw himself and his classmates in such outsized, metaphorical terms. Concentrating in Visual and Environmental Sciences\u2014\u201cI finally ended up there because I could get academic credit for the pictures and movies,\u201d he recalls\u2014Carlson studied the great 20th-century photography of Robert Capa, Larry Burroughs and Henri Cartier-Bresson, hoping some day to follow them in documenting breaking tragedies for the rest of the globe.</span></p> <p><span>Carlson attended Harvard at a time when it seems to have had a particular knack for turning out journalistic stars. He was an assistant photography editor for The Crimson at the time of the takeover, and at various points during his time there, noted critic and New York Times Associate Editor Frank H. Rich \u201971 was The Crimson\u2019s editorial chair and Atlantic Monthly National Correspondent James M. Fallows \u201970 was its president. Slate.com founder and former New Republic editor Michael E. Kinsley \u201972 was The Crimson\u2019s vice president, and technology maven Esther Dyson \u201972 an active Crimson editor and a friend of Carlson\u2019s.</span></p> <p><span>Today, these one-time colleagues have become their own elevated points of reference for a new generation of ambitious Harvard students\u2014it is their names on the lips of undergraduates with their eyes on newsprint history.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI write for Inside Triathlon magazine, you know,\u201d Carlson says with a laugh when these names come up. \u201cThat\u2019s the fact.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But Carlson says he feels no jealousy toward the contemporaries who seemed to find postgraduate success so quickly\u2014nor, he says, is he bitter anymore about the gastrointestinal ailment that prevented him from going to Cyprus as a professional war reporter all those years ago.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThen it seemed like a disaster,\u201d Carlson says. \u201cIt probably was a blessing\u2026I would have been way too affected, I would have been haunted by covering this kind of thing\u2026[I had] covered a lot of demonstrations, but war is a completely different level of meaning and experience and toll.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><b>From Iron Man to Iraq</b></span></p> <p><span>What\u2019s more, Carlson might never have ended up reporting on embedded reporters in Iraq had he become a war correspondent all those years ago. It was at the 1993 Iron Man competition in Hawaii, which he was covering, that Carlson met Triathlete magazine founder Katovsky\u2014a participant in as well as a reporter on the trials of strength and endurance.</span></p> <p><span>The two were fast friends as well as colleagues. It took 10 years, though, before Katovsky\u2019s news-junkie habits led him and Carlson to the idea that would become <i>Embedded</i>.</span></p> <p><span>As soon as they heard about the U.S. embedding program, in which journalists accompanied military units as they descended on Iraq, Carlson says he and Katovsky were fascinated by what they saw as \u201ca sea change in war coverage.\u201d In the first months of 2003, just before the U.S. invaded, he says the embedding process became something like an obsession for the two men who had spent years on the fringes of swashbuckling journalism.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe talked about it almost 15 hours a day,\u201d Carlson recalls. \u201cWe were sort of crazed about it.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>A few months and a meager $6000 advance from The Lyons Press later, Carlson, armed with \u201ca tiny 20-dollar Radio Shack mini-tape-recorder,\u201d was alone on an April 16, 2003 flight to Qatar.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThat was a place I could get into with no visa,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>He was unaffiliated with the official embedding program; the money given him and Katovsky by their publisher would cover the plane tickets and a driver into Iraq, but Carlson still had little idea of how exactly he would secure passage into the war-torn country to do his interviews. And if things didn\u2019t pan out?</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe had to pay it back if we didn\u2019t get a book,\u201d he says of the $6000.</span></p> <p><span><b>\u2018Up the River with Kurtz'</b></span></p> <p><span>Carlson certainly got a book, but not before dodging a series of obstacles, some bureaucratic, some altogether more menacing.</span></p> <p><span>After getting in touch with a public affairs officer from the American army, Carlson got from Qatar to Kuwait, where he says he spent a week \u201cdotting the <i>i</i>\u2019s and crossing the <i>t</i>\u2019s.\u201d He also had to settle the matter of getting someone to transport him over the uneasy Iraqi border.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI could have just run in with somebody, but then how would I get out?\u201d he recalls.</span></p> <p><span>Carlson says journalists staying in Kuwait advised him to call off the trip, citing their own near-death experiences as evidence that no driver could be trusted to protect his life in such a setting.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cYou can\u2019t go up the river with Kurtz,\u201d he says he was told, alluding to the grim postcolonial boat-ride of Joseph Conrad\u2019s <i>Heart of Darkness</i> and the Vietnam nightmare of Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s <i>Apocalypse Now</i>.</span></p> <p><span>In <i>Embedded</i> and in person, Carlson often cites a back-of-the-envelope statistical calculation that, as a group, journalists were about ten times as likely as coalition soldiers to die during the three-week ground phase of the Iraqi war. The book concludes with a list of 16 journalists (out of 2700) known to have died in Iraq between March 22 and July 6, 2003\u201413 of them during the earlier three-week period, in contrast with 135 coalition soldiers (out of 250,000) killed in that initial phase.</span></p> <p><span>As for Carlson\u2019s own safety, he ultimately found a driver who managed to ferry him in and out of the country intact\u2014indeed, Carlson says, the man Katovsky awards \u201can honorary NASCAR membership\u201d in <i>Embedded</i>\u2019s acknowledgements saved his life.</span></p> <p><span>On the long road to Baghdad\u2014\u201cIt reminds me of <i>Mad Max</i>,\u201d he says of the ravaged city\u2014Carlson says his driver\u2019s car was passed by a truck with weapon-bearing men inside. When the truck returned a few minutes later with a second truck, no more friendly, Carlson says his driver\u2019s agile stuntwork at the wheel might well be the only thing that prevented an instant death in the desert.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere are enough characters like that that you should be going 100 miles per hour so that you\u2019re the smallest target,\u201d he says of the Iraqi roadways.</span></p> <p><span><b>Between the Rebels and the Riot Helmets</b></span></p> <p><span>Still, Carlson says he had no desire to live out his decades-old flirtation with reporting from the frontlines at last.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIn no way was I trying to be a war correspondent,\u201d he insists. \u201cI wanted to talk to them, but I didn\u2019t want any risk.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Carlson concedes that going into Iraq at all in April 2003 was \u201ca somewhat calculated risk.\u201d He is more adamant on a theme that runs through <i>Embedded</i>\u2019s chapters: staying fair in an atmosphere as charged as Baghdad was.</span></p> <p><span>Throughout the book, journalist after journalist reveals objectivity to be an extraordinarily slippery concept when dealing with the twinned subjects of Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime and President Bush\u2019s invasion. Times reporter Burns drew prominent media attention this fall when <i>Embedded</i> included his excoriation of those of his colleagues whom he saw as kowtowing to the Ba\u2019athist government before the invasion.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIn this profession, we are not paid to be neutral,\u201d Burns says in the book. \u201cWe are paid to be fair, and they are completely different things\u2026 As far as I am concerned, when they hire me, they hire somebody who has a conscience and who has a passion about these things.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>For Carlson\u2019s part, he is careful to point out that he gave equal time to embeds from all parts of the political spectrum. Views from Voice of America and Al Jazeera, the words of a peace activist and the Pentagon\u2019s deputy assistant secretary of public affairs, appear side-by-side with what seems like every position in between in <i>Embedded</i>.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe\u2026made a pact that we had no agenda politically,\u201d he says. \u201cI have a lot of feeling, but I\u2019m not an advocacy journalist.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Long before making his way to Baghdad, Carlson was familiar with the ethical questions faced by journalists struggling to remain balanced as they report on the chaos around them. In 1969, he stood with Harvard\u2019s radicals as they barricaded the doors to University Hall, snapping pictures as the students ransacked Faculty files. When then-University President Nathan M. Pusey \u201928 called in the police\u2014whom Carlson describes as \u201clooking like gladiators\u201d as they came in at dawn carrying sledgehammers\u2014Carlson witnessed classmates being beaten and went along with the conquered occupiers to jail.</span></p> <p><span>He says that he was allowed to leave his cell when Harvard was notified that he was covering the takeover for The Crimson, but on the condition that his film be confiscated. Carlson gave authorities an empty roll and proceeded to sell his shots to Life magazine and the Associated Press.</span></p> <p><span>Several of his Crimson colleagues were in the University Hall crowds that spring\u2014some of them as reporters, some protesting themselves. James K. Glassman \u201969, who was The Crimson\u2019s managing editor the year before the takeover and away doing thesis research during it, wrote in Harvard Magazine a few years ago of his decision to abandon the shield of journalism and declare himself an \u201cobstructive demonstrator\u201d at an earlier sit-in. For punishment, Glassman explains in that article, he was put on probation and prevented from printing his own name on The Crimson\u2019s masthead during the first semester of his tenure as managing editor, though a charitable dean allowed him to remain enrolled at the College and hold that office.</span></p> <p><span>But asked on which side his allegiances fell during those turbulent years, Carlson pauses for a while. At last, he mentions the profound effect that the assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy \u201948 and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. had on him in 1968, then goes on to talk about his father and uncle, both veterans. He came to oppose the war in Vietnam vehemently, but says he still retained a great respect for the military.</span></p> <p><span>Ultimately, Carlson says his journalistic aspirations guided him to the middle of the road in a polarized time.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI wasn\u2019t as absolutely sure as a lot of other people,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I was absolutely sure that I wanted to be there to record the best and worst passions of my generation trying to do something.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><b>Split-Second Exposures</b></span></p> <p><span>Three and a half decades later, Carlson still remembers the composition of those University Hall photographs, one of which he says was \u201clike a Renaissance painting\u201d that he happened upon as it formed for a moment in the Faculty Room.</span></p> <p><span>Another of his best images\u2014the two students and Benjamin Franklin\u2019s statue\u2014he says was captured after belatedly realizing that he had wasted three hours shooting without any film in his camera.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI saw this thing aligning,\u201d he says. \u201cI held my breath and shot an eighth or a fifteenth of a second\u2026It just was electric.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Carlson describes a much more painstaking process as he and Katovsky assembled <i>Embedded</i> last spring: the interviews in Iraq plus several more done by phone from the United States, a painstaking editing process, writing an introduction to each chapter, arranging the interviews into a coherent whole.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe actually thought of it like music,\u201d he says. \u201cWe would reorder [the text] so it had the form of an arc of conversation, an arc of emotional moment.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But Carlson says their attachment to neutrality did not keep him and Katovsky from putting their own imprint on the text.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere is an authorship there,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople who are compilers are people who take already-written pieces and put them in order\u2026We were out there in the field, doing the midwifery.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff writer Simon W.

{"title": "Poll Says Students Support Kerry | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>College students are more likely to identify themselves as independents and support John Kerry than to classify themselves as Democrats or Republicans or vote for President Bush, according to a survey released yesterday by the Institute of Politics (IOP).</span></p> <p><span>The poll, which surveyed 1,205 college students nationwide, revealed that Senator John F. Kerry, D-Mass., leads President Bush by 10 percentage points and that 41 percent of students identify themselves as independents.</span></p> <p><span>Despite Kerry\u2019s significant lead, which appears to reflect increasing disapproval of the war in Iraq, a continued weak job market and the White House\u2019s stance on gay marriage, more than 37 percent of college students say they still do not know enough about Kerry\u2019s political views.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cConcern over the job market and the war in Iraq and weakness in the job market has caught up with Bush,\u201d IOP Director Daniel R. Glickman said in a press release.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cCollege students now share the general public\u2019s more mixed view of the President, and Senator Kerry is benefitting from this shift. Still these are very independent voters who are open to persuasion, and it would be in the best interests of both parties to reach out to them aggressively,\u201d Glickman continued.</span></p> <p><span>Caitlin W. Monahan \u201906, who helped direct the survey, said the results of the poll indicate that college students\u201461 percent of whom said they will definitely vote in the 2004 election\u2014will likely tip the scales in the upcoming presidential election.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe\u2019re now seeing an active and more engaged youth demographic that disagrees with the Bush administration, but also likely still impressionable,\u201d said Jonathan S. Chavez \u201905, who also helped conduct the survey for the IOP\u2019s Student Advisory Committee.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cStudents are now realigning themselves more with the national population than earlier this year,\u201d Chavez said.</span></p> <p><span>Glickman said the survey highlights not only the important national issues of this election, but also the growing significance of the young demographic.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMore than ever, college students are paying very close attention to national politics. It would be foolish for either of the candidates to lose this new generation of voters in the fray,\u201d Monahan said.</span></p> <p><span>Of particular importance, according to the pollsters, is the relative \u201csoftness\u201d of Kerry\u2019s support, since a significant number of college students still admit that they know too little about Kerry to rate him or even identify him by face.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis is more a no-vote for Bush than a yes-vote for Senator Kerry. Students are now voting on the social, economic and political issues that face our nation and are looking for any alternative to Bush,\u201d Chavez said.</span></p> <p><span>The poll also pioneered a new method for measuring the political ideology of America\u2019s college students.</span></p> <p><span>An 11-question \u201cIOP Political Personality Test\u201d determined that the traditional liberal and conservative split no longer applies to nearly half of college students, who are more accurately grouped in categories defined by moral and religious attitudes.</span></p> <p><span>While traditional liberals and conservatives encompass 32 and 16 percent of the college population, respectively, the poll adds two new categories\u2014\u201creligious centrists\u201d and \u201csecular centrists\u201d\u2014to describe college students\u2019 political affiliations.</span></p> <p><span>Religious centrists, an ethnically diverse group that comprises 23 percent of the students polled, support affirmative action and believe that religion should play a more important role in national politics. Secular centrists\u201429 percent of the students\u2014oppose affirmative action, support gay marriage and advocate a less intrusive, less religiously oriented government.</span></p> <p><span>According to Associate Professor of Public Policy David C. King, who assisted in the survey, this new political taxonomy will likely have a powerful impact on the upcoming election.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cNeither party can win simply by appealing to traditional blocs of Republicans and Democrats,\u201d King said.</span></p> <p><span>Chavez and Monahan joined Glickman in Washington, D.C. yesterday to present the survey findings to strategists and the national media at the National Press Club.</span></p> <p><span>They anticipate that the results of the poll will lead both Bush and Kerry to solicit the youth vote more actively, both by visiting college campuses and more personally appealing to the young demographic.</span></p> <p><span>On Monday, Kerry kicked off a campaign tour of college campuses.</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff writer Kimberly A.

Johnson \u201904 announced last night at Cafe Gato Rojo that she would run as Green Party candidate for State Representative in Massachusetts\u2019 25th Middlesex District.</span></p> <p><span>Johnson, a Mather House senior, will challenge Democratic incumbent Alice K. Wolf to represent the district, which comprises Harvard and Porter Square as well as part of the area around Central Square.</span></p> <p><span>Johnson was recruited by a Mass. Green Party commission designed to search for people to run for local office across the state.</span></p> <p><span>Though first proposed as a joke, Johnson took the invitation seriously and agreed to run. She needs 150 valid signatures from registered Greens or unaffiliated voters in order to get on the ballot officially. Right now she has 95 signatures, but she and a team of supporters will spend this weekend canvassing for their goal of 300 pre-validated signatures.</span></p> <p><span>Last night, the personable Johnson portrayed herself as an outsider and a political novice. She allowed an \u201cI hate him\u201d to slip out when referring to President Bush and called Massachusetts Speaker of the House Thomas M. Finneran a \u201cdictator\u201d for the way he manages the State House floor.</span></p> <p><span>Speaking casually to a group of 20 last night, Johnson drew on her youthful social life, joking that her ideas about transportation went beyond just getting home \u201con the weekend after I go clubbing.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI\u2019ll admit when I don\u2019t know something,\u201d she said after forgetting the correct name for the Mass. Supreme Judicial Court and asking the audience for assistance. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>According to Johnson, she is looking to provide an alternative to Wolf who has run uncontested in every general election since her first in 1996. Johnson called this \u201cembarrassing\u201d to Massachusetts, pointing to the fact that only 33 percent of seats in the State House were contested in 2002.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf I didn\u2019t run, there would be no one providing an alternative voice for this district,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cAlice Wolf has never had opposition in the general election. The only way to hold your politicians accountable is to vote for anyone else.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Johnson conceded last night that Wolf has done a good job considering that she is a Democrat, but Johnson said she wants to push liberal politics even further.</span></p> <p><span>\u201c[Wolf] is one of the most liberal members in the House. She can be trusted to vote well on issues. But she\u2019s not perfect,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cAnyone who supports Speaker Finneran doesn\u2019t understand how democracy works and she supports him. She\u2019s part of a Democratic structure that is not working.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>As an intern for State Representative Karen E. Spilka, who represents the 7th Middlesex District, Johnson said that every bill she cared for was stopped before coming to the floor for a vote. Johnson blamed interpersonal politicking within the Democratic majority for what she sees as inefficiency.</span></p> <p><span>Johnson\u2019s campaign chair Sarah K. Burke \u201905 echoed this sentiment, saying that although Wolf is a \u201cfantastic candidate,\u201d her ties to the Democratic Party force her to toe the party line at the expense of following the will of her liberal constituency.</span></p> <p><span>Johnson\u2019s platform involves focusing on women\u2019s safety, improving the transportation system, fighting for affordable housing systems and working towards a single-payer health care system. Johnson said she personally relates to these issues because as a soon-to-be graduate she is looking for a job.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhen you graduate, you lose your nice housing, you lose your health care. Issues of affordable housing do matter. Since rent control has been abolished, housing prices have skyrocketed,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cIf I need to make a ruckus to get things going on, I will do that.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Johnson said she has a good chance of winning, despite running as a Green Party candidate in a Democratic stronghold.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cShe has a chance of winning if she\u2019s able to get her name out there,\u201d said Stephen H. Milder \u201904, member of the Harvard College Greens. \u201cAlice [Wolf] has been in office for quite awhile. It will be tough. There is no reason to presume [Johnson] will win.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Burke said that the arena for Green Party success rests in local, not national, politics because many voters are still angry about how Ralph Nader tilted the 2000 presidential election toward Bush.</span></p> <p><span>Johnson plans on applying to graduate school and working to help herself get by if her bid for office fails.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf elected, it\u2019d be nice \u2019cause I\u2019d be helping others get by,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cPlus, it\u2019d be a great first job.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff writer Robin M.

{"title": "The Little Guy in Australia | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>On March 23, Australian opposition leader Mark Latham made a vital announcement to the public, declaring that, if elected, he would withdraw Australian troops from Iraq by Christmas. It was a bold maneuver. The U.S. coalition in Iraq\u2014already flimsy since the terrorist attacks in Spain\u2014needs unconditional endorsement from its remaining major allies, but the recent pattern suggests that the Bush administration\u2019s support from the world will be further curtailed by the end of the year.</span></p> <p><span>At present the political climate in Australia is favorable to the Bush administration. The Liberal Party presides in government\u2014led by the feisty and determined John Howard, who fought long and hard throughout his last two terms to be at the constant beck and call of the United States. The Australian Labor Party (ALP), unable to engage the Liberals\u2019 policies, has proved impotent during federal elections and\u2014until recently\u2014offered very little political competition.</span></p> <p><span>Enter Mark Latham. With Simon Crean\u2019s leadership of the ALP in serious doubt, several potential candidates began to make themselves known, but the outspoken Latham was the first to threaten the Liberals\u2019 comfortable hold on the electorate. A little over a year ago, Latham delivered a speech to the Australian Parliament, declaring, \u201cI am opposed to the government\u2019s strategy for war in Iraq because it comes from a prime minister who is too weak to say \u2018no\u2019 to the Americans.\u201d He continued, \u201cBush himself is the most incompetent and dangerous president in living memory.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Make no mistake: Australians have never been shy to question the behavior of other world leaders. In 1993, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating famously had the country denied membership to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations by calling Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad a \u201crecalcitrant\u201d for refusing to attend an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting. Despite their country\u2019s military insignificance, Australian leaders have rarely been afraid to chart their own course\u2014except, that is, when blindly supporting U.S foreign policy.</span></p> <p><span>So while Latham was not the first politician in the country to raise some eyebrows or provoke a smile, his words certainly turned some important heads. U.S. Ambassador to Australia J. Thomas Schieffer responded by attending a Liberal Party fundraising event, an unprecedented political gesture on the part of a foreign diplomat. In so doing, Schieffer essentially signaled his approval of the party that has given the Bush administration a verbal blank check for the War on Terror.</span></p> <p><span>In response to the U.S. administration\u2019s support of the current Australian government, Latham made some brave\u2014though somewhat impetuous\u2014decisions. He attacked the U.S administration and the Australian leadership, not only jeopardizing the tight relationship between the two countries and potential trade deals but also putting his leadership aspirations on the line. Sadly for John Howard, the demise of Latham never occurred\u2014and the Australian political landscape soon took on a whole new shape.</span></p> <p><span>In early December, Latham ascended to the ALP leadership, narrowly defeating his top rivals and promising to regain the government for the party. Closely watched with both fear and admiration, the new opposition leader steadily pushed away from Howard in polling since his ascension. Australia\u2019s strange parliamentary system\u2014majoritarian multi-party\u2014means great difficulty in predicting likely election results. Most polling organizations simply give the option between the two major parties, which, for the latest results from the end of March, show the ALP at 55.5 percent against a 44.5 percent Liberal coalition.</span></p> <p><span>From a practical standpoint, the United States need not worry about an opposition leader from a sparsely-populated nation with a small economy and an even smaller army. Irrelevant to the average American, Australia seems little more than a holiday locale and a former British colony. But Australia\u2019s new disdain for U.S hegemony augurs worryingly for the world superpower.</span></p> <p><span>Ever since the Second World War, Australia has followed the United States\u2014often blindly\u2014into many of America\u2019s crucial ideological battles in the hope of securing a friendship and alliance. Joining the American military presence in Korea, Vietnam and twice in Iraq ensured a bond that neither of Australia\u2019s political parties wanted to forego. Now, for the first time in some 50 years, Latham dared to challenge Australia\u2019s unspoken commitment to its favorite ally.</span></p> <p><span>The White House must surely feel its credibility in other coalition countries slipping away. The terrorist attacks in Spain quickly mobilized that country\u2019s people to elect a new anti-war government, and the United States lost one of its few allies in the War on Terror. Thankfully, it didn\u2019t take such violence to wake the Australian people from their slumber of submission.</span></p> <p><span>If Latham wins in the upcoming federal elections in Australia, due to be held sometime within the current year, the Bush administration will suffer yet another grave blow to its international relations. Australia, which could be considered the United States\u2019 most loyal ally, has now begun to question its foreign policy on Iraq. It is time the Bush administration sat up and noticed that the support for their global program of bullying is thinning.</span></p> <p><span><i>Bede A.

{"title": "DARTBOARD | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>On Wednesday, Dartboard nestled in next to her closest friends to watch the highly anticipated\u2014and highly unusual\u2014primetime press conference held by our fair George W. Only the third one of its kind since the onset of his seemingly endless tenure, Dartboard had begun to think she\u2019d only conjured the image of this ill-fated president. She quickly realized she had no such luck. So, as the night approached, Dartboard prepared to jeer and mock the out-of-good-graces leader, as is customary. But as she braced herself to wince at mispronunciations, misnomers (Secretary of the State Rumsfeld?) and tragically ill-formed sentences (\u201cThis has been tough weeks in that country\u201d) she actually gleaned something useful from the rhetorically-handicapped leader.</span></p> <p><span>Now, no one expects\u2014or dreams\u2014that Bush could ever produce a coherent or eloquent public address, unlike his predecessor. But even those most reverent of quick-witted Clinton must admit that hardly anyone could hold a candle to his charisma\u2014least of all Mr. Bush. So, it\u2019s not fair to judge poor George against such insuperable talent. Where Bush does excel, however\u2014and where Dartboard was supremely impressed\u2014is in his ability to shamelessly avoid questions, of any significance, and turn a random query into a dissertation on how he is (single-handedly) \u201cmaking the world a better place.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In an article on Salon.com, Sidney Blumenthal points out that the president \u201cwas asked three times whether he accepted responsibility for failing to act before Sept. 11 on warnings such as the President\u2019s Daily Brief of Aug. 6, 2001, titled \u2018Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S.\u2019\u201d Although it seems that such pointed questions and blatant evidence (to reiterate: \u201cBin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S.\u201d) would make anyone buckle and admit some fault, Dartboard realized that Bush\u2019s unparalleled talents rendered him completely immune to this bullying.</span></p> <p><span>Mr. Bush quickly, if incoherently, evaded the question without ever providing an answer. He responded: \u201cI\u2019m sure something will pop into my head here in the midst of this press conference with all the pressure of trying to come up with an answer, but it hadn\u2019t yet... I just haven\u2019t\u2014you just put me under the spot here and maybe I\u2019m not quick\u2014as quick on my feet as I should be in coming up with one.\u201d And though it\u2019s difficult for Dartboard to decipher Bush\u2019s peculiar vernacular, she thinks she gets the gist.</span></p> <p><span>Dartboard wonders if this type of excuse would work here at Harvard. If ever asked why she missed a section or failed to turn an assignment in on time, she is determined to flash one of Bush\u2019s glib smirks\u2014always present at the most inappropriate of moments\u2014and tell her TF that a good excuse just hasn\u2019t \u201cpopped\u201d into her head yet.</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014MORGAN R. GRICE</i></span></p> <p><span><b>Perspective\u2019s Girl Talk</b></span></p> <p><span>Harvard\u2019s liberal newspaper, Perspective, recently published \u201cThe Women\u2019s Issue.\u201d The implication here, Dartboard supposes, is that devoting almost an entire issue of a newspaper to women promotes gender equality, because women are oppressed.</span></p> <p><span>Perspective pontificates that the Ad Board shouldn\u2019t ask for evidence before investigating rape charges \u201cdue to the deeply personal nature of sexual assault.\u201d Harvard, in other words, oppresses women by not instantly transforming its Administrative Board into a kangaroo court with a diminished burden of proof.</span></p> <p><span>Other than that, it\u2019s difficult to figure out how exactly Harvard is hostile to women. Professor of Physics Melissa Franklin told The Crimson last June that the physics department here is \u201carrogant and rough\u201d for women because it is too competitive.</span></p> <p><span>The fallacy that women can\u2019t succeed in a competitive environment is precisely one of the stereotypes that feminists should be fighting. But Perspective prefers to distinguish women from men on sociological grounds\u2014in order to suggest, as Franklin does, that if only the cultural atmosphere were fluffier, women would do better. Julia H. Fawcett \u201904 writes, \u201cSomething happens when a group of women get [sic] together: the tension of competition suddenly falls away, and we begin to relate to each other.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>This is Perspective\u2019s ideal: women sitting around in support groups and \u201c[relating] to each other,\u201d to the exclusion of all men and supposedly male values like \u201ccompetition.\u201d This exclusion, which students now observe in an entire Perspective issue devoted to one gender, has consequences: Men are emasculated and expressions of their masculinity\u2014including criticism of sacrosanct television shows like \u201cSex and the City\u201d and \u201cQueer Eye for the Straight Guy\u201d\u2014become politically incorrect.</span></p> <p><span>Perspective should strive to be more inclusive. It could start by realizing that the common humanity both genders share is a real basis for equality. As it stands, Perspective prefers to harp on differences between men and women. As Fawcett writes, \u201cWe want to recognize women as different from men.\u201d In that case, Dartboard hopes that Perspective will live up to its mantra of equality and in its next issue serve up some more manly fare.</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014LUKE SMITH</i></span></p>"}

Clarke told a standing-room only crowd at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum last night.</span></p> <p><span>Clarke, a former security adviser to President Bush, has gained both reverence and notoriety in the last month after publicly criticizing the Bush administration for its failure to prevent the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.</span></p> <p><span>He reiterated his arguments last night, strongly condemning the state of national security and warning of the consequences of the war in Iraq.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe\u2019ve totally destroyed our credibility in the Islamic world and the ability to work with the Islamic world to fight the war on terrorism,\u201d Clarke said.</span></p> <p><span>The forum\u2014entitled \u201cAre We Entering an Age of Terrorism?\u201d\u2014was moderated by Graham Allison, director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at the KSG.</span></p> <p><span>Clarke, an adjunct lecturer in public policy at the Kennedy School of Government (KSG), arrived at the forum directly from his graduate-level course, \u201cPost-Cold War Security: Terrorism, Security, and Failed States.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Clarke spoke calmly and confidently for 75 minutes to a mostly receptive audience. At some points he appeared to be preaching to the choir; nodding heads and murmurs of approval were conspicuous amongst the gathered guests.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s quite clear the president and others feel they have nothing to apologize for,\u201d said Clarke.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe\u2019ve done more to fuel Islamic terrorism than anything in history,\u201d he also said, adding later, \u201cGeorge Bush has been very good to [Osama] bin Laden\u2019s movement.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Clarke said that the country is not much safer today than it was before the Sept. 11 attacks.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe haven\u2019t spent the money on homeland security that we should have spent,\u201d he said. \u201cAre you safer on a train in the U.S. after 9/11? Take the Red Line and find out.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>He warned the United States should be prepared for more terrorist attacks, suggesting that like last month\u2019s Madrid bombings, al Qaeda may strike before the presidential elections. Many believe that the terrorist attacks in Spain were a ploy to sway federal elections.</span></p> <p><span>Asked by Allison about President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney\u2019s upcoming testimony before the 9/11 commission, Clarke recalled a lesson from his high school debating coach. Clarke, who grew up in Cambridge and Boston, attended Boston Latin School.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cNever deny the obvious,\u201d Clarke said his coach told him. \u201cIt is a piece of advice the people going before the 9/11 commission\u2014and those who are going together\u2014might want to bear in mind,\u201d he said, referring to Bush and Cheney\u2019s plans to joint testify.</span></p> <p><span>Though the focus of the talk stayed mostly on Clarke\u2019s criticisms of the administration, possible solutions also came up.</span></p> <p><span>The United States needs \u201cprominent, articulate Islamic leaders we could look to for counterweights,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cWe have to get inside the head of the enemy.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Harvard Republican Club member Ryan M. Delahoyde \u201906 called Clarke\u2019s views \u201coverly partisan.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe kept mentioning how 9/11 was preventable,\u201d Delahoyde said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t really delve into anything about Clinton. He just focused on what Bush did wrong.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think Bush has done a lot towards knocking out al Qaeda in Afghanistan and in Iraq. I don\u2019t think terrorists are exactly thriving at this point,\u201d said Delahoyde.</span></p> <p><span>But Andrew J.

{"title": "Marching For Women\u2019s Lives | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>If you\u2019re not going, chances are you know someone who is. Hell, my mom is flying out all the way from Berkeley. This Sunday, Washington, D.C. will be the place to be, when hundreds of thousands of women (and men) converge upon the city for the much anticipated \u201cMarch for Women\u2019s Lives.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>A march of this magnitude, rare even by DC standards, means something\u2019s up. Indeed, the event is fueled by a palpable sense of urgency. The Bush Administration has laid siege to women\u2019s reproductive rights here at home, and it is sacrificing women\u2019s lives abroad in the name of political expediency.</span></p> <p><span>The most contentious issue, of course, is abortion. Congress recently passed the \u201cUnborn Victims of Violence Act,\u201d a law that effectively grants fetuses the legal status of persons. At issue is clearly not the protection of pregnant women\u2014an otherwise identical bill that dropped the-fetus-as-person language was shot down. Even many pro-life supporters unapologetically admit that the law is intended to lay the groundwork for a future legal challenge to Roe.</span></p> <p><span>But the march is about more than just abortion. Another hot button issue is emergency contraception, a shameful example of science subordinated to politics. Despite the full approval of two FDA scientific advisory panels, the agency is bowing to pressure from conservative groups and stonewalling efforts to allow a new brand of emergency contraception to be made available over-the-counter. A possible FDA \u2018compromise\u2019 recently floated in the press would single out teenage girls, prohibiting them from buying the drug without a prescription. This is nonsense; if anything, teens have more to gain from over-the-counter access than do older women who enjoy easier access to prescriptions. Even the New England Journal of Medicine has jumped into the debate, asserting that teenage use was explicitly approved by the advisory panels and that there is no scientifically valid reason to limit access.</span></p> <p><span>Foreign delegations, many from developing countries, will also march this Sunday. Seem strange? It\u2019s not. Harmful conditions on American foreign aid are killing thousands of women around the world. According to Ellie Smeal, president of the group Feminist Majority which is cosponsoring the march, \u201cWe used to say, \u2018if we lose (abortion rights) women will die.\u2019 You will not hear that at this march. You will hear, \u2018women are dying, are being injured, because it is now driven home how devastating these policies are.\u2019\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Thanks to the Global Gag Rule, a pernicious Reagan policy reinstated by the Bush Administration, foreign NGOs that use their own funds to perform abortions, offer abortion counseling or lobby for legalizing abortion in their countries are denied U.S. aid. The White House has blocked funding to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) \u2014a key international family planning care provider\u2014for two years running on charges that they finance abortion services in China. (UNFPA denies the charges and their story was recently corroborated by an independent delegation of experts.)</span></p> <p><span>Then there is the whole abstinence debacle. In the face of an overwhelming public health consensus, the White House continues to fund \u201cabstinence only\u201d sex-ed programs throughout the U.S.  More troubling is that precious millions from the President\u2019s global AIDS budget have been earmarked for these programs abroad.</span></p> <p><span>The Bush White House is often taken to task for being long on politics and short on policy. Indeed, even when the President does take a strong stance to protect women\u2019s health, it\u2019s in an effort to appease his base. A striking example is the case of international sex trafficking, a global blight that each year ensnares an estimated two to four million women and children and forces them into sexual servitude. For years, the U.S. government did little to confront the issue. But when evangelical Christians began voicing concerns the President was quick to listen, and strong new legislation soon followed.</span></p> <p><span>I find this story heartening. President Bush doesn\u2019t wish ill upon the women of the world, he just wants to get reelected. And there is nothing inherently wrong with a little responsiveness to the voters\u2014we do live in a democracy after all. Which brings us back to Sunday\u2019s march.

{"title": "Rabbi Supports Gay Marriage | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Alex Fortes", "body": "<p><span>A case for supporting gay marriage based upon the Jewish religious tradition was presented to two dozen students, faculty and community members yesterday afternoon at Susan and Richard Smith Family Hall at Harvard Hillel.</span></p> <p><span>Rabbi David Ellenson, president of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, said in a literary, humorous and at times quite personal discussion that the Jewish concepts of dignity and equality that stem from the creation of man in God\u2019s image trump any other specific biblical mandates against same-sex marriage.</span></p> <p><span>While he presented his views as religious arguments in favor of same-sex marriage, he was also careful to point out that his reading of scripture does not reflect those of the Jewish community as a whole.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think it is a plausible reading, albeit a unique one,\u201d Ellenson said.</span></p> <p><span>His argument, which he said was inspired by New York University law professor Ronald Dworkin\u2019s Law\u2019s Empire, centered on the prominence of the interpretive process in Jewish tradition and the need to reevaluate ancient Jewish principles and rules continually in the context of contemporary civilization.</span></p> <p><span>Ellenson drew a distinction between this position of \u201cLiberal religion\u201d with the Orthodox Jewish position that the Scripture is the literal word of God.</span></p> <p><span>But he also suggested that the Orthodox tradition is inherently interpretive because the rules and principles of the past are always evaluated in some present context.</span></p> <p><span>As an example of this interpretive tradition, he cited the decision of Talmudic scholar Johanan ben Zakkai to end the practice of requiring women accused of adultery to drink \u201cbitter waters\u201d in order to determine their guilt because it did not apply in a contemporary social context.</span></p> <p><span>While he admitted that homosexuality is always portrayed in a negative light in Jewish texts, Ellenson looked at tradition in a broader sense.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cJewish tradition wants to assert that a relationship between two people who are in love physically as well as emotionally can be consecrated,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>He also said that any scriptural passage that degrades humanity cannot be truly divine\u2014a notion he credited to Catholic feminist scholar Elizabeth Schussler Fiorenza.</span></p> <p><span>In his talk yesterday, Ellenson also explained his personal reasons for his views.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI had the same views most heterosexual teenage males had about homosexuality, and never really even thought about these issues,\u201d said Ellenson, who grew up in Newport News, Va.</span></p> <p><span>He said his views began to evolve when, as a professor, he got to know some of his students, who were openly gay.</span></p> <p><span>He was also influenced by Steven Greenberg, an Orthodox Rabbi from Wisconsin who recently came out of the closet.</span></p> <p><span>While he has held these views for years, Ellenson said his choice to speak out was prompted by this year\u2019s State of the Union address, in which President George W. Bush called for the protection of the institution of marriage by denying same-sex couples the right to marry.</span></p> <p><span>Having grown up in the South during the years of the Jim Crow laws, Ellenson said that the issue of gay marriage is \u201cvirtually identical\u201d to that of civil rights in the South.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cTo deny [gays and lesbians] the bonds of matrimony strikes me in my day as simply cruel, given the knowledge we have of human sexuality and the nature of the relationships that can be attained between two same-sex individuals,\u201d he said.</span></p>"}
{"title": "The Unripe Youth Vote | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>By and large, America\u2019s youth have historically remained an untapped resource in politics\u2014to the detriment of the country as a whole. The youngest section of the electorate has been the least engaged in our nation\u2019s great business of political warfare; however, it is imperative that the youngest voters\u2014those voters who will soon be our doctors, lawyers, teachers and laborers\u2014be intimately acquainted with the ins and outs of the great ideological issues of our times. Therefore, it is deeply encouraging that one of the nation\u2019s most eloquent politicians (who just so happens to be campaigning for president) has turned the full force of his flowery orations toward the promotion of a patriotic esprit in young people. When Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., the presumptive Democratic nominee for the presidency, embarked on a college tour this month, we were especially pleased that he decided to take on the demons of cynicism and apathy in the hearts of America\u2019s youth, and intends to bring young voters into the circle of democratic activism. Although Kerry\u2019s tour concludes on Friday, it is rather just the beginning of the fight\u2014in more ways than one.</span></p> <p><span>In this pursuit, Kerry continues the work begun by Gov. Howard Dean\u2019s campaign. Regardless of the Dean campaign\u2019s intrinsic merits, or even of Dean\u2019s own personal appeal, his campaign resonated with what his advisers optimistically termed \u201cGeneration Dean.\u201d If Kerry can capture that energy and enthusiasm, stoke it, and harness it, he will surely benefit in November while doing an invaluable service for the country that transcends his own political fortunes. In fact, we strongly encourage all politicians, from across the political spectrum, to genuinely reach out to youth voters. President George W. Bush himself can likely benefit from attempts to enliven young voters. Although the Republicans have had a tradition of less-than-hip candidates who seemed out of sync with youth culture\u2014from the vivacious Bob Dole to the studious Alan Keyes\u2014Bush should follow Kerry\u2019s lead and attempt to energize young voters.</span></p> <p><span>But even more important than talking to college students is listening to them and demonstrating that the issues college students care about also matter in the broader political arena. Riding motorcycles is all very well, but actually addressing issues that directly affect the youth is a far more effective campaign strategy. Issues such as the rising cost of higher education and the cutthroat job market affect students on a day-to-day basis; the burgeoning national debt and the increasingly clouded conflict in Iraq have broad implications for America\u2019s future\u2014and America\u2019s youth will be the ones responsible for sorting out the consequences.</span></p> <p><span>Yet as much as national leaders have a duty to bring college students into the political fray, college students have an equal duty to actively engage elected officials. In other words, young voters should continue making their voices heard, and above all they must utilize that power that all Americans are granted: the right to vote. Students cannot afford to wait for candidates to come to them. They must use their numbers\u2014and their activism\u2014to force candidates to address the issues that they want addressed, in the way that they want them addressed. The country will be better off for it.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Gay Marriage Sooner, Not Later | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Since the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) ruled against the constitutionality of restricting marriage to heterosexual couples in November, opponents of gay marriage have stopped at almost nothing to delay the issuing of marriage licenses to gay couples scheduled to begin on May 17. The latest comes from Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, who is seeking, through emergency legislation, to appoint a special counsel that would ask the court to postpone its final ruling for another couple of years\u2014in hopes that a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage recently approved by the state legislature may be passed by voters before any marriage licenses are issued. Last month, Democratic Attorney General Thomas Reilly refused Romney\u2019s request for a stay on the ruling until November, 2006, the date for the referendum. Now, Romney is desperately trying to subvert and manipulate a process that has refused to bend toward his own ends.</span></p> <p><span>Though recent debates surrounding the issue of gay marriage have made it seem primarily an issue of abstract morality, the possibility that in less than a month Massachusetts citizens\u2014and maybe even some Harvard students\u2014will be among the first gay couples in the country to marry makes the matter seem much more real. If the SJC lets its ruling stand, the question of gay marriage will pass quickly from the realm of panel discussions and philosophical debate to the realm of Massachusetts residents\u2019 daily lives as homosexual couples begin to enjoy a right heterosexual couples take largely for granted. The state of Massachusetts is extremely close to taking a crucial step forward in the history of the nation. We are disappointed that the Commonwealth\u2019s governor is so determined to keep the state right where it is.</span></p> <p><span>Indeed, it is unfortunate that the petty scheming of politicians like Romney may stand in the way of such enormous progress. If the court\u2019s ruling is postponed and voters are allowed to decide on the proposed amendment, a simple majority may very well refuse to share a right that should be inalienable\u2014a step that will be extremely difficult to correct. While the principle of majority rule is the ideological basis of any democracy, the principle that the rights of the minority should be protected is equally fundamental to both the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the United States. One of the primary functions of the judicial system is to provide this protection, which the SJC did in its November ruling. By attempting to circumvent the court\u2019s ruling, Romney is undermining the essential precautions that the government has set up against the disenfranchisement of minorities.</span></p> <p><span>On a moral level, the granting of marriage rights to gay couples is unassailable, and whether it happens in a month or in twenty years, it seems a virtual certainty that gay citizens across the country will be given the right to marry. But until that day, politicians like Mitt Romney and George Bush, whatever obstacles they may put in the way, are only postponing progress.</span></p>"}
{"title": "The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Some of Harvard\u2019s politically savvy students work for campaigns after college, but it\u2019s the rare graduate who starts her own. Carolina S. Johnson \u201904\u2014a presidential name if we\u2019ve ever heard one\u2014is doing just that. The Mather House senior is launching a third-party bid for the 25th Middlesex District Massachusetts state representative seat. She\u2019ll be running on the Green Party ticket in a district that includes Harvard, Porter Square and areas around Central Square. Victory isn\u2019t guaranteed, but like the Panthers in Super Bowl XXXVIII, Carolina is ready for a fight. She\u2019s already made her mark on campus. After the 2000 election, she co-founded the Harvard College Greens, and she has remained active in local politics throughout her time in Cambridge. FM met up with her on the campaign trail.</span></p> <p><span><b>1. How did you first get involved in the Green Party?</b></span></p> <p><span>Freshman year, I got involved in the Ralph Nader campaign. I heard him speak several times and I really enjoyed what he had to say. The World Trade Organization protests in Seattle really upset me my senior year of high school. The way the entire country flared up against the possibility of another candidate running got me involved in the Green Party and third-party politics, because I realized how important it was. People weren\u2019t even allowing these voices to be heard.</span></p> <p><span><b>2. Why did the Green Party ask you to run for state representative?</b></span></p> <p><span>One of [the Party\u2019s] main goals for this election cycle is to try to run people in as many districts as they could for state and local elections. People from the Middlesex County committee approached me and kind of as a joke said, \u201cWell, you should run.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><b>3. Were you originally planning on staying in Cambridge after graduation?</b></span></p> <p><span>I wasn\u2019t sure what I wanted to do originally. I studied [abroad] in Oxford my junior year, and I was wanting to go back to England eventually but I decided to wait to apply to grad school. I wanted to stay here in Boston.</span></p> <p><span><b>4. Are you a government concentrator?</b></span></p> <p><span>I am joint social studies and women\u2019s studies, social studies primary.</span></p> <p><span><b>5. Are other members of your family named after states? </b></span></p> <p><span>No, none of them are. I wasn\u2019t named after a state either, actually. I was named after my mother\u2019s good friend who happened to make her wedding dress.</span></p> <p><span><b>6. Why should Harvard students pay more attention to local politics?</b></span></p> <p><span>Harvard students, whether they like to think about it or not, are part of this community. They chose to come to Boston, they chose to come to Harvard. I mean, there\u2019s more going on than just Harvard University here. The representatives in this district represent Harvard students and this community to the state and the decisions that are made in the state house affect the students who live here\u2014things like how late the T runs. The fact that [students] don\u2019t care about local politics at all, for the most part, is ridiculous to me.</span></p> <p><span><b>7. You announced your candidacy at the Caf\u00e9 Gato Rojo. Any particular reason you announced there as opposed to, say, Harvard Hall?</b></span></p> <p><span>First off, I spend a fair amount of time there, so I was familiar with it. We wanted a space that wasn\u2019t that big; none of us had time to make a huge event out of it. And we wanted to have a band, which we got. It was meant to be a welcoming, friendly environment.</span></p> <p><span><b>8. Will the Mather House Committee or the Mather Department of War be assisting you in your campaign?</b></span></p> <p><span>I haven\u2019t approached them yet. I think that that\u2019s not an impossibility, but I wouldn\u2019t say it was something I was planning as my campaign strategy. I hadn\u2019t actually thought of it. Now that you mention it, I\u2019m going to have to approach them about that.</span></p> <p><span><b>9. Do you plan on campaigning at Mather Lather?</b></span></p> <p><span>I\u2019m not sure people would be paying much attention to me. Maybe if I did ridiculous things people would pay attention to me but that may not be the best campaign strategy.</span></p> <p><span><b>10. What\u2019s the first bill you would bring up in legislature? </b></span></p> <p><span>I can\u2019t say that. I\u2019m not going to make a joke about that because this is a campaign.</span></p> <p><span><b>11. Are you planning on voting for Ralph Nader for president in November? </b></span></p> <p><span>I also won\u2019t say who I\u2019m voting for in the presidential election. A lot can happen in six months, and I don\u2019t necessarily like the way Nader has dealt with this election in that he bypassed the Green Party\u2019s primary nominating process. I\u2019m very undecided. I won\u2019t be voting for Bush, that\u2019s for sure. But other than that I can\u2019t tell you.</span></p> <p><span><b>12. Did you receive flak from friends or acquaintances because you worked on the Nader campaign? </b></span></p> <p><span>My friends generally were pretty good about it. It was mainly strangers on the street. After the election, a lot of people were very abusive about that\u2014 swearing at me, screaming at me. Pretty much being unreasonable.</span></p> <p><span><b>13. You\u2019re not on thefacebook.com. Any particular reason? </b></span></p> <p><span>That\u2019s just the fact that I\u2019m doing a lot of things and one thing my brain doesn\u2019t need to think about is whether I\u2019m on thefacebook.com. Maybe right before graduation I\u2019ll sign up and then I\u2019ll realize I should have been on the whole time.</span></p> <p><span><b>14. Would you be anxious about handling yourself at the State House as a local college graduate? </b></span></p> <p><span>No.</span></p> <p><span><b>15. You\u2019re running against incumbent state Rep. Alice K. Wolf (D., Mass.) in the fall. Would you make your campaign theme song Duran Duran\u2019s \u201cHungry Like the Wolf?\u201d </b></span></p> <p><span>I\u2019m currently debating what my campaign theme song would be. There\u2019s been a lot of ones thrown out, and I\u2019m kind of\u2026 I\u2019ll take that into consideration.</span></p>"}
{"title": "The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>When Democratic presidential hopeful Howard Dean threw off his jacket, rolled up his sleeves and let loose the scream heard across America, no one saw where the jacket landed. But Michael O\u2019Mary \u201999-\u201900 saw, because he was standing in the stage buffer the night Dean lost the Iowa presidential caucus, stretching his arms out to receive it.</span></p> <p><span>He was there. Just as he\u2019d been there in the parking lot in New Hampshire, chasing Dean after the candidate impulsively jumped on the back of a moving truck. In fact, there was hardly a waking moment O\u2019Mary hadn\u2019t spent by Dean\u2019s side.</span></p> <p><span>But nobody remembers that now, and in a way blending in has always been part of O\u2019Mary\u2019s job. As sometime speechwriter, advance man and travel aide for some of the biggest names in Democratic politics, he\u2019s part of a corps of self-effacement, the anonymous suits and volunteer drudges that toil behind the candidate.</span></p> <p><span>Yet few have moved up through the ranks as fast or as soon as O\u2019Mary. The willingness to drop everything (repeatedly), having an unerring talent for being in the right place at the right time, and one or two Harvard connections were all it took. At 26, his resume glitters with names like John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, the Gores, Larry Summers and Howard Dean. His jobs have placed him in a White House wracked by the Monica Lewinsky scandal, in Nashville and Florida for the 2000 election recount disaster and in Massachusetts Hall for the fairly tempestuous beginning of the Summers presidency.</span></p> <p><span>And this past year, when former Vermont governor Howard Dean fought his battle to remake the Democratic party in his image, O\u2019Mary was at his side.</span></p> <p><span>O\u2019Mary may look and sound like a 1950s television boy next door, all grins and simple declarative sentences, but his childhood was anything but all-American. Born in Saudi Arabia to a Peruvian mother and a South Arkansan father in the oil business, he attended high school in Dubai. His brief spates in the U.S.\u2014to visit family in the south, or after being evacuated during the first Gulf War\u2014didn\u2019t do much to create roots. Maybe that\u2019s why O\u2019Mary took so well to the campaign trail, crisscrossing an America he had yet to know as his own.</span></p> <p><span>He didn\u2019t see Boston until just before freshman week, when he arrived to do dorm crew. \u201cMy first impressions involved mopping floors and cleaning bathrooms,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>One of his first-year roommates had never been out of the Eastern Standard Time zone, much to O\u2019Mary\u2019s shock. \u201cWhen I was growing up,\u201d he says, \u201cthree time zones seemed pretty close.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>At Harvard, O\u2019Mary dabbled in Institute of Politics (IOP) activities and joined the Undergraduate Council (UC). While the IOP rejected him for a Director\u2019s Internship in his first year, they didn\u2019t forget him. A last-minute spot opened in Senator John Kerry\u2019s office. The IOP called O\u2019Mary for the job, and he got a taste of Washington life at the bottom of the ladder. And when he returned to Harvard the following year, he turned his focus to campus politics. UC presidential candidate Lamelle D. Rawlins \u201999 chose him as her running mate.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe tried to subvert one of our freshman year parties into a UC election stump speech,\u201d says Pawel A. Swiatek \u201999, O\u2019Mary\u2019s longtime college roommate. \u201cHalfway through he started talking to people about running for UC.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Rawlins was elected president, but voters passed on O\u2019Mary in a rare case of splitting the ticket.</span></p> <p><span>O\u2019Mary continued with the UC even after he lost the election, but soon took on a paid administrative job at the IOP. There, then-fellow David Wilhelm, who\u2019d been the national manager of the Clinton/Gore campaign in 1992 and went on to be the youngest person to chair the Democratic National Committee, saw something in him: a babysitter.</span></p> <p><span>When O\u2019Mary talks about his trajectory in politics, he denies being a master networker. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a conscious effort on my part to try to get to know people because I thought it was going to be helpful,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I had known what I know now, I definitely would have made much more of an effort to get to know people who were coming through [at Harvard].\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But there was more going on there than childcare. O\u2019Mary says Wilhelm encouraged him to apply to the White House internship, even making a call on his behalf. By the summer, O\u2019Mary had been installed in the Chief of Staff\u2019s office, where he languished in boredom.</span></p> <p><span>When he applied for a transfer he experienced a scene that is likely echoed in seats of power across the country. At the table for a job interview, the nervousness clears with a magical question: what House were you in at Harvard? As O\u2019Mary made the case for his transfer to the speechwriting office of the First Lady, the Quincy House resident faced Lissa Muscatine \u201976 and June Shih \u201994, and he could talk Harvard. He was in.</span></p> <p><span>So O\u2019Mary found himself in what was known as\u201cHillary-land,\u201d one of few men in a female-dominated wing of the White House. A month later, a researcher left and Muscatine offered him a paid job. He grabbed the chance and took a year-long leave of absence.</span></p> <p><span>O\u2019Mary had just wrapped up his sophomore year, making him only slightly older than Chelsea Clinton, but he was researching and writing her mother\u2019s speeches. Meanwhile, Muscatine, who went on to have a substantial role in the writing of Clinton\u2019s bestselling memoir Living History, let him crash in a house she and her husband planned to eventually tear down. \u201cThere were delays, so I basically lived in a huge mansion by myself in Bethesda for eight months,\u201d says O\u2019Mary.</span></p> <p><span>Inside the White House, the state of whirlwind never subsided. When Hillary Clinton addressed the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, for example, she insisted on writing the speech herself but at the last minute had an aide call the White House from Europe to unearth a half-remembered Weber quote.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt was just after the White House library closed,\u201d recalls O\u2019Mary. \u201cThe aide said the first lady was going to wait up for it. I\u2019m thinking, where on earth am I going to find this?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Desperate, he turned to dorm-mate Stephen E. Weinberg \u201999, who was a Social Studies concentrator.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI get back from work one day and there\u2019s a message on my answering machine saying, \u2018Stephen, call me at the White House right away,\u2019\u201d says Weinberg. \u201cOne does not usually take long to return such a call.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Weinberg didn\u2019t have that book with him, launching a chain of conference calls around the country to find fellow veterans of Social Studies 10 who had Weber in tow. Says Weinberg, \u201cI ended up standing in the back of a bookstore on a payphone, reading two pages of Max Weber over the phone to Michael in the White House and connected by satellite to one of the First Lady\u2019s staffers in Vienna, who was writing it all down verbatim.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But O\u2019Mary was less lucky when the now Senator Clinton departed from the talking points he\u2019d prepared for her when she participated in a round table with a group of Israeli and Palestinian youth. Long before administration policy had endorsed it, Clinton called for a Palestinian state, causing considerable consternation among her staff. O\u2019Mary, as the staff contact for the event, was bombarded with calls and had to defend his innocence.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think I was smart enough to know that at 20 I wasn\u2019t going to slip in a big policy change on the Middle East,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>When O\u2019Mary did return to Harvard, he kept on privileging his professional life over being a college kid. That year and the following summer, he did advance trip planning for the Gore campaign and then continued putting together New Hampshire events in his senior year.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI didn\u2019t write a thesis,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause I knew I was going to get calls saying, \u2018Can you go to New York, can you go to Florida?\u2019\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Most of his friends graduated as scheduled, while O\u2019Mary moved off-campus to live with his girlfriend, now his wife, Jessica R. Taylor \u201999. When he\u2019d  bought an engagement ring for Taylor in Houston and brought it to Florida for a Tipper trip, Mrs. Gore was in on it and told stories about the Vice President proposing to her on one the bridges over the Charles.</span></p> <p><span>Even at a university that teems with undergraduates playing grownup, O\u2019Mary\u2019s fast-track entrance into the adult world was unusual.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI felt like I was doing very grownup stuff and I was having a great time with it,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think there was any time that I was thinking, \u2018Wow, I could really be hanging out at the Fly or going to that party in Quincy house.\u2019\u201d</span></p> <p><span>A few days after Commencement, O\u2019Mary was on the Gore for President payroll as an advance man, plunging headlong into campaign hysteria. He led a team to draw thousands of people to Tipper Gore\u2019s streetcar ride through New Orleans, DJed the Vice President\u2019s floating parties down the Mississippi River, and spent hours on his cell phone procuring ingredients for a campaign treat: s\u2019mores in ziplock bags labeled \u201cThink s\u2019more, vote for Gore.\u201d He even debated the finer points of Spanish grammar with the presidential hopeful.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe did a good job of carrying Mrs. Gore\u2019s purse,\u201d laughs Vanessa Flindt LaVallee, who was Tipper Gore\u2019s trip director at the time.</span></p> <p><span>After the last 72-hour stretch in Tampa with Tipper, O\u2019Mary hopped on a plane to Boston, took a cab to Quincy House, voted and then got right back in a cab to catch his plane to Nashville. Even if a vote for Gore in Massachusetts didn\u2019t necessarily \u201ccount,\u201d he says, \u201cI was not going to go through a year and a half of campaigning and not vote.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>On election night, everything converged on Nashville\u2019s Loews Vanderbilt Plaza Hotel. O\u2019Mary tore himself away from the room of CNN watchers to pick up more field staff from the airport. Some came off their plane cheering because the pilot had told them Florida had been called for Gore. O\u2019Mary had to tell them it had been taken back.</span></p> <p><span>After hours of confusion and conflicting reports, a crowd gathered in War Memorial Plaza to watch CNN on massive screens, and perhaps for a concession speech. They waited, soaked in the cold rain of November. \u201cAll of a sudden, the graphic on the screens just changed to Bush, President of the United States,\u201d says O\u2019Mary. \u201cEveryone was crying, shouting. Nobody knew what was going on.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Joseph N. Sanberg \u201901-\u201902, O\u2019Mary\u2019s close friend and fellow Gore staffer, remembers comforting friends that had broken down. \u201cIt was a mixture of fatigue, stress, sadness,\u201d he says. \u201cYou felt like it had all come to an end.\u201d It hadn\u2019t. Campaign chairman William Daley took to the stage to announce that Florida was still under dispute. Just then, as O\u2019Mary and Sanberg remember it, the rain stopped.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cYou throw everything in your being at what you\u2019re doing, knowing that on a Tuesday in November it\u2019ll all end and you\u2019ll be able to sleep the next day,\u201d says O\u2019Mary. \u201cFor us, the next day never came.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Sanberg and O\u2019Mary went down to Florida, hoping to protest, but found little to do right away. Drained, they went to Disney World.</span></p> <p><span>Back in Boston, Harvard had hired itself a brash new president. A. Clayton Spencer, Associate Vice President for Higher Education Policy, remembered O\u2019Mary from his days as an undergraduate work study research assistant in the University President\u2019s office. O\u2019Mary took on a job for Lawrence H. Summers that hadn\u2019t existed in Neil Rudenstine\u2019s tenure: Special Assistant to the President.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt was more help that I\u2019d been in Washington than at Harvard,\u201d says O\u2019Mary. \u201cIt was a sense that I was someone who understood his world and yet also understood Harvard.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>O\u2019Mary made himself an office in the basement of Massachusetts Hall by moving some file cabinets. From there he prepared the briefing books and oversaw the details for two years, through terrorist attacks, nationally publicized spats and political pronouncements.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cPresident Summers gave Michael a lot of responsibility and I know he really listened to him,\u201d says former Summers chief of staff Marne Levine.\u00a0\u201cThey had an ability to joke with one another. Michael had concentrated in economics so he really took the opportunity to learn from Larry. There was a mentor-mentee kind of relationship there.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In an inscription to O\u2019Mary, Summers was even more effusive. \u201cYour wisdom, Diet Coke, a smile-\u2014what more could a man want?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Last month, when Hillary Clinton came to Boston to accept an award at the John F. Kennedy Library, she sought out some face time with O\u2019Mary, who had done some advance for the event. Clinton hadn\u2019t forgotten his days on her staff, and she also knew what he\u2019d been up to more recently. She wanted O\u2019Mary to tell her: what had gone wrong in the Dean campaign?</span></p> <p><span>O\u2019Mary\u2019s America is mapped out by the front lines of presidential primaries, by Sheratons and situation rooms. He can recite jet plane particulars, has the phone numbers of endless political operatives stored in his Blackberry, and still has the customized nametag from his first trip on Air Force One. But he hadn\u2019t planned on going back on the political trail\u2014until Dean.</span></p> <p><span>It began with an email over a Clinton White House alum listserve from a Dean staffer, suggesting that everyone check out the obscure former Vermont governor. O\u2019Mary, who had applied to law school armed with a Summers recommendation letter, had every intention of starting at Boston College Law in the fall. He was only looking for a summer job.</span></p> <p><span>Why Dean? It was early in the primary season, and most of America had yet to figure out who he was. The droves of acolytes grew as summer turned to fall, drawn by the image of Dean as a maverick. Though O\u2019Mary would never be a \u201cDeaniac\u201d\u2014years behind the scenes had made him wary\u2014maybe he\u2019d had enough of spin.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cDean just seemed to me the only person who was saying what he thought and not just what was politically expedient,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>Doing occasional advance work in New Hampshire led to a job offer to be New Hampshire trip director. Once again, he had to choose between the campaign and going back to school.</span></p> <p><span>For the youthful political elite, the under-30 veterans of Clinton and Gore, the best bet to get back to the White House was, at that point, to join up with Kerry or Edwards.</span></p> <p><span>But at the Dean campaign, \u201cit was a group young, energetic, committed people who believed in what they were doing, who weren\u2019t doing it because they wanted to go to the White House,\u201d says O\u2019Mary. \u201cThey were doing it because they wanted to change America.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>So he chose Dean.</span></p> <p><span>By September, Dean had chosen him, too: the campaign was growing, and O\u2019Mary got a call asking him to be the governor\u2019s personal aide, what the press corps refer to as a \u201cbody man.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>According to Matt Vogel, a Dean press aide, the town hall events O\u2019Mary had run in Spokane, Washington went unusually smoothly in a campaign where things often went wrong. This was not lost on Howard Dean. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like he said, \u2018I need someone on the road with me,\u2019\u201d says Vogel. \u201cHe said, I want Michael O\u2019Mary with me. I want someone who\u2019s done this before.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>O\u2019Mary never hesitated and the campaign started out modestly, in borrowed minivans and Motel 8s. Sure, O\u2019Mary was in the inner circle, but being behind the scenes wasn\u2019t always pretty.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cFor the most part, it\u2019s long plane rides, long car rides, long bus rides,\u201d says Vogel. \u201cYou pull in and walk past the dumpster, walk up a fire escape, down a hallway full of pipes, and wait in the back kitchen\u2014and then you go onstage. Politics is not glamorous.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>And for O\u2019Mary, the job was full time.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt means you\u2019re up before the candidate, and on the other end of the day, you\u2019re up after the candidate making sure the office knows who he called and didn\u2019t during fundraising hour,\u201d says Glen Johnson, the Boston Globe reporter who covered the Dean campaign.</span></p> <p><span>The tasks of a body man could be menial\u2014lugging around equipment, taking business cards and snapping photos\u2014but they gave him nearly unlimited access to a growing phenomenon in American politics.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cO\u2019Mary brought an extra dimension,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cThis was a guy who\u2019d been raised in the Middle East, educated at Harvard, and I think probably could talk policy with the Governor as well as carry his bags. I\u2019m not saying he necessarily did, but you can never have too many smart people around any candidate.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>By most accounts, Dean trusted O\u2019Mary absolutely. O\u2019Mary estimates that in those months, they spent about 90% of Dean\u2019s waking hours together. And as America discovered Howard Dean, O\u2019Mary learned more esoteric details, such as Dean\u2019s obsession with collecting state quarters and his fondness for a certain kind of Wisconsin root beer.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe was probably the only person in the campaign that had an idea of what was going on from all different angles,\u201d says Felix Schein, the MSNBC reporter on the campaign trail. \u201cBut he never betrayed what he knew at any point. He was really a rock of stability in a place where things were very chaotic and hectic.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>O\u2019Mary is ruddy-faced, boyish and matter of fact. When it came to taking the governor through labor union rallies and hobnobs with Drew Barrymore and Jason Alexander alike, he would rest a hand on the candidate\u2019s arm and intone, \u201cGovernor Dean, we need to go.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe\u2019s not flashy. I think that\u2019s what made him so good at it,\u201d reflects Schein. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t sort of a character, either. He\u2019s steady.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Reporters on the trail recall with varying degrees of frustration how tight-lipped he was about Dean. \u201cHe was not a resource to us at all, and that\u2019s exactly the way he wanted it,\u201d says Schein. Even now, O\u2019Mary remains talkative but guarded; it\u2019s not that he\u2019s evasive, it\u2019s just that he sticks to the basics. He speaks as though he sees the world in words like \u201cfun\u201d and \u201cinteresting.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The Dean campaign\u2019s gradual transition into a roaring success broke all the rules. \u201cWhen I\u2019d done trips for Al or Tipper Gore or for Hillary Clinton, the rule of thumb was, 100 people say they\u2019re going to show up, 75 will,\u201d says O\u2019Mary. \u201cIf for Howard Dean 100 people said they were going to show up, you better have room for 250.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Then there was that brief, manic period where the candidate was hailed by some as the Democratic messiah.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe\u2019s not so much of a natural back-slapping politician,\u201d O\u2019Mary says. \u201cI think he\u2019s more of a policy wonk. I think it surprised him. People just wanted a piece of him, they just wanted to touch him, which I think would drive anybody crazy.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But the bubble was about to burst. O\u2019Mary says he had his first misgivings when the entourage arrived in Iowa. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel tight or well organized. It always felt like we were improvising. It always felt like we were doing things that didn\u2019t make sense from a political point of view.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The campaign had peaked early. They suffered a barrage of negative press and attacks from other Democrats between November and January. But few were prepared for the humiliating loss of the Iowa caucuses.</span></p> <p><span>When the bad news came, O\u2019Mary was with Dean, piling into a luxury bus named Aretha, after the soul singer who had once used it. As the political consultants and managers frantically tried to figure out what Dean should say to accept his caucus defeat, O\u2019Mary was already on the next step, pacing back and forth with his cell phone at his ear.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMy job that night was to make sure we got to New Hampshire after delivering the speech,\u201d he says. \u201cI was making sure the satellite uplink was ready. I was talking to our scheduling director facilitating the movement that night on the plane. All those little details had to be done.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>O\u2019Mary is still indignant when Dean is described as angry, and says he rarely saw the former Governor lose his temper. But up there on stage that night, Dean started listing states, emitted that bellow and launched the end of his campaign.</span></p> <p><span>Before the extent of the damage became clear, Dean watched himself giving the speech on TV on the campaign bus and everyone laughed. O\u2019Mary says he came up with the line, \u201cI\u2019m so excited I could scream,\u201d which Dean used on several occasions.</span></p> <p><span>But humor wasn\u2019t enough. The campaign dragged to an eventual halt in Wisconsin four weeks later. It seemed that after the promise of a new kind of politics, Dean would be relegated to the status of cautionary tale.</span></p> <p><span>The morning Dean finally quit, O\u2019Mary was awoken by John Edwards calling his cell phone, trying to get a hold of Dean. Fifteen minutes later, a John Kerry aide followed. It was over.</span></p> <p><span>O\u2019Mary still maintains that this path through politics was uncharted, that doors opened and he simply walked through them. \u201cI\u2019ve never actually set out to get a specific role in politics, and that\u2019s actually served me very well,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve been extraordinarily lucky and fortunate\u2026my experience has been that if you do a good job and you know people, eventually they\u2019ll ask you do something and it may become something good.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Despite his insider knowledge, he has no intention of running for office. For one thing, he was born in Saudi Arabia, which these days does not endear a candidate to voters. Plus he has no real home base from which to run. For another, he likes being out of the spotlight.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI\u2019ve seen it up close,\u201d he says, \u201cand I\u2019d rather be the guy behind the guy in politics than doing it myself.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Would anything\u2014say, a Kerry win\u2014 make him come out of hibernation after he starts law school in the fall? He won\u2019t rule it out.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Abolish Corporate Taxes | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>According to the federal General Accounting Office (GAO), 60 percent of U.S. companies did not pay corporate taxes between 1996 and 2000. Wasn\u2019t that during a boom, you ask? Was that not the time during which government coffers should have swelled with the fruits of that juicy 33 percent corporate tax rate? It certainly should have been. Unfortunately, economics has once again shown that the incentives and rewards in the private sector are taking all the talented loophole-leapers away from the public sector, leaving public funding high and dry. Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., said recently that he intended to get \u201ctough\u201d on corporate America\u2014just like every previous Democratic nominee. But if the government has not yet worked out how to collect taxes from 60 percent of U.S. companies in the middle of an economic boom, then it is hard to imagine that the situation is going to improve anytime soon. A better option would be to give up: corporate taxes are remarkably inefficient, consistently failing to raise the revenues they should\u2014and yet taking up enormous resources at the Internal Revenue Service. The United States would probably be much better off raising taxes which are equitable and easy to collect.</span></p> <p><span>This is unlikely to happen. First of all, most people abhor the idea of removing taxes on corporations. After all, in the mind of anti-globalization leftists, they are the engine of all the world\u2019s ills. Even Kerry seems somewhat muddled: in a comment in the Wall Street Journal a spokesperson for Kerry said he \u201cwants to make America more fair, so that average Americans don\u2019t have to pick up the tab for corporate-America profits.\u201d What politicians fail to remember is that people own companies, and many of those people are pretty average and just happen to have a few pieces of Exxon in their 401K. Taxing corporations ultimately takes money away from these people. A more nuanced argument would propose that since rich people have more wealth in the form of stocks, then we should tax corporations for that reason alone. But taxing the rich is much easier and more effective if you tax people individually. By having corporate taxes we are allowing thousands and thousands of people, many of them more wealthy than average, to pool their efforts and talents in tax avoidance. As a result, the rates of corporate tax avoidance are far higher than they could ever be on a rigorously-enforced individual basis.</span></p> <p><span>The problem largely rests in America\u2019s indecision as to whether it wants to tax rich people as highly as other countries do. Some parts of the tax code, like the estate tax (or \u201cdeath tax,\u201d if you\u2019re talking to a Republican) and corporate taxes, imply that Americans would, on the whole, like to tax the rich. Others, like the various incentives for saving and investment, inevitably favor those who can and do save\u2014the wealthy. Some might argue that this is just a function of a two-party system where a tax code is written piecemeal, but history does not match the facts. Most of the incentives for saving and exceptions for capital gains were written into the tax code by the Clinton administration, which also raised the top marginal tax rate\u2014at once decreasing and increasing the burden on the rich. If anything, it is the muddled policy-making of Democrats and Republicans who don\u2019t have majorities in either the Senate or the House of Representatives.</span></p> <p><span>The best thing any government could do would be to abolish corporate taxes, the failed savings incentives and capital gains exceptions of previous years and play it straight with the electorate. People should be taxed based upon their cash income, since that is ultimately what they use to make purchases. Then the government has to decide just which income groups are going to pay how much of the tab for keeping government services and infrastructure running. Tough decisions, to be sure, but ultimately this is something about which the electorate can make an informed decision rather than trying to see through the spin and obfuscation of the current debate.</span></p> <p><span>Corporate taxes have been the least funny joke in the absurd tax code for some time now, and it is time for the laughing to stop. The United States spends an absurd amount on both ineffective spending and revenue-raising programs\u2014and this is one of the worst, with well over half of firms taking the federal government for a ride. Instead of trying to beat corporations at their own game, the U.S. would be much better off going after the real target of corporate taxes. The wealthy tend to own more equity and should be taxed directly rather than through a corporate vehicle. Doing so might not be palatable to politicians who have used complex tax policy to mislead the public for some time, but this change would ultimately get to the heart of redistribution of wealth without the wasted time and hot air.</span></p> <p><span><i>Alexander B.H.

Snyder \u201907, who said she attended the lecture because she knew Pinker to be an engaging lecturer from his Core class Science B-62, \u201cThe Human Mind,\u201d found his scientific explanations of everyday behavior \u201ctypical.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe always talks in class about how \u2018the mind is what the brain does\u2019 and how the concept of the soul is being debunked by science,\u201d she said.</span></p> <p><span>Kerry J. Dingle \u201905, president of the Harvard Secular Society, called this lecture, which was held in conjunction with the Harvard Humanist Chaplaincy, a \u201chuge success.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cScience can\u2019t disprove religion\u2014I look at philosophical arguments to do that. But it\u2019s heartening as an atheist to see what people construe as the \u2018spirit\u2019 in purely naturalistic or scientific terms,\u201d she said.</span></p> <p><span>Brian S. Gillis \u201907, however, had the opposite reaction.</span></p> <p><span>Calling himself a \u201cstruggling Christian,\u201d he said he attended this lecture purely on a whim and was excited to see that the topic of the speech would be the \u201cGod module.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>He said he was hoping to have the question \u201cIs God a fabrication of my life?\u201d answered.</span></p> <p><span>But, if anything, Gillis said Pinker\u2019s speech affirmed his faith.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI\u2019m not sure if Pinker\u2019s ever been religious, but there were a lot of holes in his reasoning,\u201d he said, specifically mentioning Pinker\u2019s failure to address \u201cbooks upon books of empirical evidence in support of particular religions.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But Gillis signed up for the Secular Society\u2019s e-mail list and expressed interest in further discussion with Pinker.</span></p> <p><span>Others shared his sentiment.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI\u2019ve always been fascinated by what makes people believe so strongly in something that can\u2019t be proven,\u201d said Megan E.

{"title": "The \"L\" Word | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>It was a lively week for wrestling and politics. Last Friday, visiting KSG Fellow Jesse \u201cThe Body\u201d Ventura publicly mulled a 2008 presidential bid. The day before that, a spokesman for the Kerry campaign declared that \u201cGeorge Bush\u2019s failed economic policies have put the middle-class in a world of hurt.\u201d Booyah!</span></p> <p><span>Kerry has been \u2013 ahem \u2013 grappling with some important economic issues lately, but the poor guy has been squirming around in a tight political headlock. In recent years, the Right has wrestled the policy debate over to its side of the ring, and many perfectly sensible policies are now strictly off limits for any Democrat who hopes to get elected\u2014which is most of them. Desperate to dodge the \u201cliberal\u201d label, Kerry has been boxed into a corner (if you\u2019ll pardon the mixed metaphor). And unless the Republican-imposed taboos can be broken, the country may soon be on the ropes.</span></p> <p><span>Hillary Clinton\u2019s Medicare/Medicaid debacle taught the Right that stigmatizing pays political dividends. Try looking for any mention of single-payer health insurance in Kerry\u2019s platform\u2014it\u2019s like hunting for WMD in Baghdad. Gore didn\u2019t dare touch it in 2000. President Clinton himself dropped the subject after 1994, when his wife\u2019s plan went down in flames. Ever since, the Right has cowed Democrats on the issue by labeling any single-payer proposal as \u201cHillarycare\u201d or \u201csocialized medicine\u201d. And the public pays the price\u2014literally, in the form of escalating health insurance costs. Every year, health insurance costs ratchet up about 15 percent, and over 41 million Americans currently have no coverage at all. Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz has shown how imperfect information in private health insurance markets forces up premiums, and how mandatory public health insurance programs can overcome this market failure. But any Democrat who dares to propose such a plan would be heckled off the national stage as an \u201cold school liberal.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Encouraged by the triumph of dogma over economic reason on the health care front, the Republicans are taking the battle to taxation. These days, anything goes when you\u2019re cutting taxes, but tax increases are virtually taboo. Even reversing recent cuts is portrayed as supporting high taxes. As Bush told Congress in his State of the Union speech, \u201cThe tax reductions you passed are set to expire...Unless you act, Americans face a tax increase.\u201d In the face of the $4 trillion of deficits the Congressional Budget Office projects for the decade, Kerry\u2019s promise to repeal Bush\u2019s tax cuts for the top two percent of households is a step in the direction of fiscal sanity. But he knows the Republicans would label him a tax-hiking liberal if he touched the rest of the tax cuts. In fact, in order to avoid being written off as the Second Coming of Dukakis, the Kerry campaign has proposed $225 billion in new middle-income tax cuts.</span></p> <p><span>Sure, it\u2019s better to give tax cuts to people who can use them than to the ultra-rich. But our bipartisan mania for tax-slashing has real costs. In order to rein in the deficit and cut taxes simultaneously, Kerry is proposing a total spending cap on discretionary spending outside of defense and education (about 20 percent of the federal budget), instead of allowing government expenditure to remain at a stable proportion of GDP, growing at the same rate as the economy. But rising production and consumption place rising demands on our national infrastructure, which needs to keep pace with the economy\u2019s growth. Moreover, as per capita income grows, we can afford more of all types of goods, including government services. Freezing our provision of everything from scientific research to transportation to environmental management at their 2004 level is completely arbitrary.</span></p> <p><span>In fact, in this era of globalization, extreme fiscal austerity is particularly harmful. Harvard economist Dani Rodrik has shown that the most open economies tend to have sizable public sectors, because government consumption can be used to offset the income volatility that free trade typically generates. The Big Government Bogie, in other words, may actually make free trade politically and economically sustainable. \u201cScaling governments down without paying attention to the economic insecurities generated by globalization,\u201d Rodrik cautions, \u201cmay actually harm the prospects of maintaining global free trade.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Of course, Kerry has to choose between capping spending and letting the Bush deficits swell. But let\u2019s be clear: We are in this bind because voters have bought into the credo that, when it comes to taxes, What Goes Down Must Not Come Up. Perpetual and irreversible tax cutting is a recipe for a fiscal crunch, and we\u2019re hurtling toward one now, as the GOP pursues ever more tax cuts and Democrats feel compelled to follow.</span></p> <p><span>It\u2019s tempting to just say Democrats should grow some cajones and confront the right-wing taboos head on. But until Americans look beyond the \u201cliberal\u201d label, there\u2019s not a lot Democratic politicians can do about the Right\u2019s knuckle-headed policies. And if voters don\u2019t get informed, our rude awakening is going to arrive, sooner or later, in the form of a national economic smackdown.</span></p> <p><span><i>Eoghan W.

Underlying these parodies, however, was the belief that what President Bush lacked in clarity of speech, he made up for in moral clarity and an old-fashioned sense of responsibility.</span></p> <p><span>In the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, Americans saw the President give simple, moving speeches. His cockiness was replaced with a sense of mission and an urge to shore up America\u2019s defenses against a potent new threat. He told Americans that we had \u201cnew responsibilities\u201d in a world altered by terrorism.</span></p> <p><span>But he has shirked his.</span></p> <p><span>At a press conference chock-full of furrowed brows, misquoted facts and insincere serpentine smiles, President Bush tried hard to deflect blame for everything from the Sept. 11 attacks to Iraq\u2019s missing WMDs. This press conference, only the third of his presidency, showed Americans a chief executive trying desperately to do damage control. But unanswered questions about WMDs and shifting justifications for the Iraq war, as well as the President\u2019s general evasiveness, undercut the moral clarity and responsibility of a man Americans once chuckled at good-naturedly. By refusing to accept the slightest blame, or answer the most straightforward questions about his actions, President Bush has become a parody of himself.</span></p> <p><span>Maybe he thought voters would still believe that Iraq is rife with WMDs just waiting to be found. As he said in the press conference, \u201cSee, I happen to believe that we\u2019ll find out the truth on the weapons\u2026They could be hidden like the 50 tons of mustard gas in a turkey farm [in Libya].\u201d Of course, as a sheepish White House spokesperson Scott McClellan revealed later, there were actually 23.6 tons of mustard gas, and they were not buried in a turkey farm. Former top U.S. weapons inspector David Kay, once a vehement believer that Iraq had WMDs, has admitted that he and most of the international community were wrong. According to Kay, even France and Germany, the war\u2019s most vigorous detractors, believed Iraq had WMDs. Everyone\u2019s intelligence estimates were off. Yet President Bush refuses to admit he was wrong, even though there would be few, if any, negative consequences.</span></p> <p><span>Maybe he thought Americans wouldn\u2019t notice his subtle changes in word choice to describe our goals in Iraq. Where our troops used to be dying to promote \u201cdemocracy\u201d in Iraq, at the press conference Bush mentioned only \u201cfreedom.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Maybe he thought the public wouldn\u2019t notice his evasive answers. When asked why he was appearing together with Vice President Dick Cheney before the 9/11 Commission to answer questions about the preventability of the September 11 attacks, Bush first said: \u201cBecause the 9/11 Commission wants to ask us questions, that\u2019s why we\u2019re meeting.\u201d Perhaps thinking that Bush was repeating the question to help the studio audience follow along, the reporter clarified that he wanted to know why they were appearing together. Bush then furthered his previous response: \u201cBecause it\u2019s a good chance for both of us to answer questions that the 9/11 Commission is looking forward to asking us.\u201d Presumably many people watching at home had to check to confirm that they were, in fact, watching a presidential press conference and not an SNL parody.</span></p> <p><span>Maybe he thought that voters shared his belief that the U.S. has a divinely inspired mission in Iraq. As the President said: \u201cFreedom is the Almighty\u2019s gift to every man and woman in this world. And as the greatest power on the face of the Earth, we have an obligation to help the spread of freedom.\u201d President Bush must not recognize how incredibly dangerous his administration\u2019s sense of religious entitlement is. Not only does framing America\u2019s wars as Christian missions threaten to alienate what few Muslim allies we have left, it also makes our more secular allies uncomfortable. After all, Europe\u2019s last religious war ended in 1648. To promote freedom, America first must embrace all free nations with rhetoric that everyone can agree on\u2014rhetoric that doesn\u2019t include God.</span></p> <p><span>President Bush may be the leader of the free world, but true leaders admit mistakes, answer pointed questions and make an effort to be diplomatic. Bush\u2019s performance at last week\u2019s press conference showed that this president is willing to pass the buck to anyone, even God. If America truly wants to remain the leading power in the fight for freedom world-wide, it could start by demanding a responsible chief executive.</span></p>"}

Board of Education decision in a talk at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum last night.</span></p> <p><span>Rod Paige used the Forum to argue that U.S. public education\u2014long criticized for the \u201cachievement gap\u201d it has perpetuated\u2014is on the road to remediation. Paige\u2019s talk kicked off a conference this weekend commemorating Brown\u2019s fiftieth anniversary at the Kennedy School of Government.</span></p> <p><span>He said President Bush\u2019s No Child Left Behind Act, of which he was a major architect, follows through on Brown\u2019s goals.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThose who fought against Brown were on the wrong side of history, and those against No Child Left Behind will be judged so as well,\u201d he told the packed Forum.</span></p> <p><span>Opponents of Bush\u2019s program were among the audience members. Several members of the educational community from Harvard and elsewhere openly criticized the policy during a question-and-answer session that followed Paige\u2019s talk.</span></p> <p><span>The program requires all students to meet statewide education standards by high school graduation. Evaluation is based on a system of annual standardized testing in reading and mathematics.</span></p> <p><span>Schools that do not show progress toward the standards are scrutinized and, in some cases, restructured.</span></p> <p><span>Some critics in the audience contended that the program could unintentionally drive educational standards down rather than up. Others questioned the program\u2019s reliance on standardized testing to evaluate schools\u2019 needs and success.</span></p> <p><span>But Paige said he didn\u2019t think reliance on standardized testing as an indicator of success is unreasonable.</span></p> <p><span>He rejected charges that \u201cteaching to the test,\u201d as a result of the program\u2019s requirements, would impair U.S. education.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe don\u2019t make a big distinction between the test and the standards,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should be essentially the same thing.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>A large amount of information, he also said, could easily translate into success in the classroom.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe think that with a high level of information, it makes the instruction much better,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Emphasizing what he called the program\u2019s \u201caccountability,\u201d Paige tied the recent educational legislation to the 1954 Brown decision.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cBrown opened the door, and now No Child Left Behind allows opportunities within the building,\u201d he said, referring to an effort to overcome the achievement gap that presently plagues higher education as \u201cthe civil rights struggle of our time.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Paige discussed his own experience growing up in racially segregated Mississippi, claiming that the experience continues to inform his educational outlook.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI wonder whether anyone who has not lived through segregation can imagine how horrible it was,\u201d he said. \u201cYou knew first-hand that anything you did was wrong.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Paige, who had to travel north to be enrolled in a graduate program, said he remembered exactly where he was when he first heard about the Brown decision.</span></p> <p><span>Still, he said, segregation did not immediately disappear\u2014leaving many of the inequity problems that the No Child Left Behind attempts to address today.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe have a long way to go,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd education is the battlefront.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Last night, Paige declined to comment on his description of the National Education Association\u2014which spoke against No Child Left Behind\u2014as a \u201cterrorist organization\u201d at February meeting of state governors.</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff writer Nathan J.

Ave. storefront three years ago has reinvented itself with a look from the past.</span></p> <p><span>This morning, the Adidas \u201cOriginals Store\u201d will open its doors to the Cambridge crowd, selling reintroduced clothing and footwear from its classic lines.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe have a very exclusive product here and we feel that the market is the right fit,\u201d Kerry Barnes, the director of retail stores for Adidas, said last night at a promotional party for the new store.</span></p> <p><span>According to Adidas spokesperson Kelly Middal, all products for sale at the Cambridge location take their cue from past designs and bear the clover-like \u201ctrefoil\u201d logo, which was first introduced in 1972.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cPeople like to call this gear retro, but it\u2019s not,\u201d she said. \u201cThese products are actually the original.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The store carries a selection of track jackets, pants and shorts and several models of sneakers.</span></p> <p><span>Only two other classics stores exist in the United States, in the SoHo area of New York City and in South Beach in Miami, though some of the revamped line is available through other retailers, including the Tannery in the Square.</span></p> <p><span>Barnes said he expected the Square to be an accommodating location for the originals line because of its \u201ceclectic\u201d clientele and its historical ties.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe really feel that Harvard\u2019s rich history, matches Adidas\u2019 history,\u201d he said, adding that Adidas was founded in 1920 as a company that built shoes for professional athletes.</span></p> <p><span>But the store\u2019s last attempt to carve out a niche at Harvard flopped after just a year.</span></p> <p><span>Adidas first moved in to its location on the corner of Mass. Ave. and Plympton Street in March 2000, but closed up shop in April 2001.</span></p> <p><span>Barnes said that though the store closed then because \u201cit wasn\u2019t the right fit\u201d with the Square, Adidas thought the intervening period has made potential customers more receptive.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe Square has changed a lot over the past four years,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are many more retailers and we feel that this is now the right market.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>He pointed to the apparel selection as practical, \u201clifestyle\u201d pieces, touting a 1976 training shoe he said was regularly worn by Starsky and Hutch and reappeared in the recent movie.</span></p> <p><span>On hand last night to explain how the originals merchandise is chosen was Jon Wexler, who is in charge of selecting Adidas footwear for the U.S. market.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cBasically we look in the vault and see what was good then and reintroduce it for now,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s how we carve out our niche,\u201d he explained, picking up a 1974 driving shoe with Goodyear soles.  \u201cThis thing\u2019s on fire. On the West coast, this is pimp, but on the East coast it may have a more European flavor.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Barnes said that Adidas is very conscious of demographics in its marketing.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe have our core age group of 18 to 24-year-olds right here in the Square,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>In order to reach out to that core age group, Barnes said that the Adidas store will be teaming up with a group of Harvard students to promote the undergraduate-run Veritas record label.</span></p> <p><span>The label, which includes six Harvard student bands, will receive merchandise and financial support from the store.</span></p> <p><span>Matthew L. Siegel \u201905, the vice president for Veritas, said that Adidas was \u201clooking for something organic and local\u201d to work with in Cambridge and learned about Veritas through some students.</span></p> <p><span>Siegel said that he had worked closely with the store to organize last night\u2019s promotional party, which included a handful of student guests.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAdidas really has a focus on what\u2019s going on locally,\u201d said Daniel J. Zaccagnino \u201905, the president of Veritas.  \u201cThey want to put student artwork in the store, play student music while people are shopping and just get to know the neighbors.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Nicholas H. Ma \u201905, who was also at the party last night, praised Adidas for \u201cnot just selling shoes, but also enhancing the Harvard music scene.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s great to see newcomers to the Square connecting to newcomers to Harvard,\u201d said Ma, referring to Veritas, which plans to release its first CD, a compilation of songs by student bands, in May.</span></p> <p><span>Amidst the buzz in the sports apparel store\u2019s last night was one veteran of the athletic world.</span></p> <p><span>Modeling a pair of remade 1980s \u201cIvan Lendl Comp\u201d tennis shoes was the tennis great himself.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThese are my favorites,\u201d Lendl said, lifting his pant leg to display the three-stripe logo. \u201cWhen this shoe came out it was absolutely revolutionary.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>And representing the New England Revolution, Boston\u2019s professional soccer team, were team members Jay Heaps and Pat Noonan, who sported gear from their sponsor.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis stuff is what everyone\u2019s trying to get right now, but can\u2019t,\u201d Heaps said of the classics design.</span></p> <p><span>But when doors open tomorrow, Cambridge consumers will have much easier access to the originals line\u2014which Sam W. Lessin \u201905 predicted would sell.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think it\u2019s a really interesting concept,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir retro stuff is a different flavor than traditional sportswear.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff writer Wendy D.

{"title": "The Tyranny of the Poll | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>A recent Time/CNN poll asked 1,005 adult members of the general public how well they thought \u201cthings are going in the country these days.\u201d Fifty-one percent said they thought that things were going very or fairly well. Well, well! Fear not, for the lukewarm public has spoken!</span></p> <p><span>But wait! An equally recent Associated Press asked 1,001 folks whether they thought the country was \u201cheading in the right direction\u201d or \u201con the wrong track.\u201d Turns out 57 percent thought that the country was on the \u201cwrong track.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>What gives? Who is this \u201cgeneral public,\u201d anyway? A distant cousin to notary publics, or a newly interpreted incarnation of Rousseau\u2019s social contract? Is it some sort of populist organization? I\u2019ve sure as hell never signed up for it. In fact, I\u2019m a little scared by the whole idea. What kind of a general public purports to speak for everyone and then goes around contradicting itself? This reminds me a bit of what Groucho Marx said\u2014\u201cI don\u2019t care to belong to a club that accepts people like me as members.\u201d But according to pollsters, I am a member. If the whole idea didn\u2019t make me a little uneasy, I might just put it on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9\u2014\u201c22-Year Member of the General Public (in Good Standing),\u201d it would say. I guess I would put it under \u201cExperience.\u201d (I can just see the ad campaigns: \u201cThe General Public: Shaping public opinion for over 100 years!\u201d)</span></p> <p><span>But I digress. (My apologies.) Here\u2019s the deal: there is no such thing as the \u201cgeneral public.\u201d It\u2019s a fiction, a fatuous farce, as much as the Easter Bunny, Santa Claus and weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. But just because these things don\u2019t exist doesn\u2019t mean that they aren\u2019t incredibly powerful rallying points. Santa Claus almost single-handedly incites massive consumerist frenzies during the holiday season. Likewise, polls and their \u201cgeneral public\u201d do as much to cement massive conformity as they do to highlight differences in opinion.</span></p> <p><span>When it comes down to it, polls put people together that really don\u2019t have any connection to each other. Sure, 51 percent of those polled may have said that they think the country\u2019s doing just fine. But it\u2019s all an illusion. What we call \u201cpublic opinion\u201d is just the after-dinner musings of the 510 citizens who answered their telephones and, after a moment of consideration, answered a multiple-choice question (And I\u2019ll be damned if it\u2019s not the most vague, open-ended question I\u2019ve ever seen.) When it comes down to it, what does it mean that 51 percent of those polled think that the country\u2019s doing \u201cfairly well\u201d or better? Nothing! Absolutely nothing. What these polls give us is a way of feeling like we\u2019re not alone in our opinions. \u201cLook!\u201d we seem to say, pointing to a new poll on the popularity of Issue X or Personality Y, \u201cI\u2019m not alone! There are others like me!\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Alexis de Tocqueville noticed this, I think (without the help of a polling apparatus), during his 1830 trip to America. He writes that democratic nations like America \u201chave neither leisure nor taste to think out new opinions. Even when they are doubtful about accepted ideas they stick to them because it would take too much time to examine and change them. They hold to them not because they are certain but because they are accepted.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>I wonder why we have polls. Who are they for? What good do they do us? Are they tools to help our public officers shape their behavior to better satisfy their citizens, or do they help the voting public to form their own political opinions? In a democracy, there ought to be no real use for polls. After all, if you are entitled to your opinion, what does it matter if 67 percent of poll respondents (read: the General Public) disagree with you? And if you\u2019re free to vote for whomever you wish, does it matter whether Kerry or Bush is ahead in the polls?</span></p> <p><span>Of course it does. Because we\u2019re not interested in personal freedom of thought. What we really want is to be in good company. It\u2019s oh-so-comfortable to belong to a group of people who share your opinions, even if that group is abstract and statistical\u2014numbers on a page. If we really wanted to think for ourselves, we\u2019d demand to be rid of the oppression of the \u201cgeneral public\u201d and its confounded opinions.</span></p> <p><span>I suppose there\u2019s some fitting irony in the recent Harris Poll that found that 72 percent of respondents believe that public opinion has \u201ctoo little power and influence\u201d on \u201cpolicy, politicians, and policymakers in Washington.\u201d I guess I\u2019m in the uncomfortable minority on this one.</span></p> <p><span><i>Christopher W.

At the Alamo, under their leaders Col. William Barrett (Patrick Wilson), Davy Crockett (Billy Bob Thornton) and James Bowie (Jason Patric), almost 200 men from all different races and backgrounds fought bravely to the death against the Mexican army, led by General Santa Anna (Emilio Echevarria). While there were no survivors, their fight for Texas inspired General Sam Houston (Dennis Quaid) to lead 910 pioneers in the Battle of San Jacinto against General Santa Anna\u2019s army with the famous battle cry, \u201cRemember the Alamo.\u201d A larger budget and more violence could have helped better convey the epic scope of these battles, but, in contrast with previous portrayals, are determined to create realistic heroes, warts and all. The best performance is Thornton\u2019s, who, as the charismatic Davy Crockett, superably demonstrates the pressure of a good man struggling to live up to his great name. While the movie struggles to deliver a truly unforgettable account of the famous battles, the film is beautifully shot and tries to capture the true character of the leaders in the Alamo and Battle of San Jacinto. (HRM)</span></p> <p><span>BON VOYAGE</span></p> <p><span>Jean-Paul Rappeneau\u2019s latest film mixes the chaos in Paris just before the Nazi occupation with a hearty dash of scandal, intrigue and romance. Although Rappeneau\u2019s recreation of this war-torn era is undeniably excellent, his grasp of plot and characters is tenuous at best and not enough to redeem the film\u2019s many faults. Newcomer Gregori Derangere is the perpetually bemused Frederic, an impoverished writer still in love with his childhood crush. She\u2019s now the popular actress Viviane Denvers (Isabelle Adjani, who looks like she\u2019s been given a severe dose of Botox). So intoxicating is Viviane\u2019s hold on Frederic that he doesn\u2019t mind being imprisoned for a crime she committed, later following her across France to Bordeaux\u2019s Hotel Splendide. A crop of rabid aristocrats have also gathered at the Splendide to escape the madhouse of Paris and badger the wait-staff nonstop for rooms\u2014God forbid they sleep in their cars, with their suitcases and hatboxes! Serendipity and coincidences abound in Bon Voyage\u2014but then everyone\u2019s running around so frantically that it would be impossible for them not to bump into each other at the most opportune, or most inopportune, moments. So do subplots, many of which are left maddeningly unresolved. At times the film verges on self-parody\u2014Viviane\u2019s hammy, melodramatic antics, for example: the way she throws herself on her bed, her eyes oozing crocodile tears. Bon Voyage is not all bad\u2014it\u2019s just silly, unoriginal, and pointless. (TIH)</span></p> <p><span>CONNIE AND CARLA</span></p> <p><span>Writer-star Nia Vardalos\u2019 follow-up to indie smash My Big Fat Greek Wedding treats gay transvestites with the same loving care she previously slathered over the Greeks: she reduces them to the sparest possible stereotypes in order to make as many \u201cain\u2019t this wacky\u201d jokes as is possible in this wildly mediocre rehash of Some Like It Hot. Like in that classic comedy, two performers witness mob violence and go on the run. This time the heroes find refuge on the gay circuit, where they pretend to be men dressing up as women. Eventually David Duchovny shows up to provide a heterosexual love interest. (SAW)</span></p> <p><span>DOGVILLE</span></p> <p><span>Much has been made of the supposedly anti-American attitude behind Dogville, Danish director Lars von Trier\u2019s (Dancer in the Dark, Breaking the Waves) latest portrait of a woman wronged by society. But even as the action unfolds in a Rocky Mountains village of von Trier\u2019s invention, the film\u2019s statement about the nature of humanity is clearly far more general than a shrill denunciation of the American dream or George W. Bush\u2019s administration. Like many a great dramatic work\u2014think Richard III or Oedipus Rex\u2014the setting is merely a backdrop for the message. A misanthropic deconstruction of Thornton Wilder\u2019s 1938 play Our Town, Dogville draws very much on theatrical (and literary) conventions in order to depart from more traditional cinematic renderings and privilege the message over the medium. The ensemble cast performs every bit as well as its marquee actors should imply. Nicole Kidman shows us why she should only act in art films; Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, Lauren Bacall, Patricia Clarkson, and Ben Gazzara all live up to their names; and Paul Bettany, an upstart compared to his castmates, shockingly manages to upstage the veterans with a performance that should make his career. (ABM)</span></p> <p><span>ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND</span></p> <p><span>In director Michel Gondry\u2019s latest effort, a company named Lacuna Incorporated has acquired the technology to erase the foul taste of a past partner. Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) discovers this after tracing a note to ex-girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet), asking mutual friends not to raise his name in conversation with her. Since the ex is not supposed to see these notes, Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson), the inventor of the treatment and the founder of Lacuna, agrees to perform the operation on Joel as well. The centerpiece of the movie begins as Joel slowly realizes that, though his final memories of the relationship are tough to handle, he wants to remember at least some of the more pleasant aspects. Jim Carrey is actually quiet for significant pieces of the role: he underplays, giving Joel a quiet dignity that makes the eventual disgrace in losing control over his own mind that much sadder. Exiting Sunshine is looking at the world with new eyes, possibly the highest tribute that can be paid to art. (SAW)</span></p> <p><span>THE GIRL NEXT DOOR</span></p> <p><span>The Girl Next Door isn\u2019t a typical high school comedy, though it certainly does a good job of camouflaging itself as one. Included are all the necessary ingredients: the loser who might look vaguely attractive if he got a haircut and an Urban Outfitters gift certificate, his nerdier, uglier friends and the gorgeous blond that saves them from an eternity in A/V club purgatory. But in this particular film, that life-saving blond is an ex-porn star. The loser in question is Matthew Kidman, played by newcomer Emile Hirsh, who falls in love with his neighbor, Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert), the instant he sees her. The film then proceeds to try to convince us that Matthew\u2019s love has very little to do with Danielle\u2019s curvaceous figure or pouty lips, but rather her ability to bring him out of his shell. The movie depicts every teenage boy\u2019s fantasy, as Danielle immediately takes Matthew under her wing and introduces him to a life of skipping class, belly shirts, and strip clubs. But the plot seems secondary to director Luke Greenfield\u2019s desire to experiment with the use of porn as a motif while still adhering to the restrictions of an R rating. The mold of the standard high school film is certainly broken with The Girl Next Door, but in this particular instance, the result is merely soft-core blandness. (DME)</span></p> <p><span>GOOD BYE LENIN!</span></p> <p><span>Good Bye Lenin! centers on the experience of East Berliner Alex Kerner, played by wide-eyed 24-year-old Daniel Br\u00fchl, after the fall of the Berlin Wall. After fainting during the Berlin riots, Alex\u2019s mother (Katrin Sass) enters a deep coma for several months. Upon his mother\u2019s release, the doctor cautions Alex that he must insulate her from any shocks, because a stressful event could kill her. Since his mother was fiercely loyal to the idealism of the DDR, Alex makes it his goal to keep her from finding out about the dramatic political changes through which she slept. Good Bye Lenin! is dotted with distilled illustrations of the many facets of the reunification, some of which shine much brighter than others. He does not fall into the trap of romanticizing the past at the expense of historical fact; his characters cherish their new conveniences and freedom of expression, and don\u2019t miss the panoptic party structure of socialism. (WBP)</span></p> <p><span>HELLBOY</span></p> <p><span>Although this had all the makings of a routine genre exercise\u2014only one man can stop a madman from taking over the world\u2014director Guillermo del Toro and star Ron Perlman are too witty to settle into clich\u00e9. The result is a thoroughly enjoyable action-comedy that takes obvious pleasure in its faith to its comic book roots and Jeffrey Tambor. Really, what more can you ask? (SAW).</span></p> <p><span>JERSEY GIRL</span></p> <p><span>After the death of wife Gertrude (Jennifer Lopez), Ollie Trinke (Ben Affleck), a workaholic music publicist whose pathological impatience is both his greatest asset and worst liability, is left to take care of their baby, a daughter he names Gertie. Unable to cope with his wife\u2019s death or his new role as parent, Trinke immerses himself in work until his father, Bart (George Carlin), refuses to take care of Gertie any longer. Flustered, abandoned, and completely covered in baby powder, Trinke has a very public nervous breakdown at a news conference. Though Affleck should never attempt to cry on film (or say the line \u201cI\u2019m gonna be the best daddy in the world!\u201d), Jersey Girl nevertheless benefits from his non-method approach to acting, which fits in with the film\u2019s down-to-earth style and subject matter. Like all of Smith\u2019s previous movies, Jersey Girl is almost as littered as New Jersey itself with curse words, sex jokes, and an long list of A-list cameos (some amusing if predictable, others genuinely surprising). Having based his career thus far on sexual innuendoes and pot references, Smith has produced a surprisingly insightful movie about definitions of family and success in an ever-accelerating world. With an ending that is predictable without being formulaic, Jersey Girl should appeal to a wide spectrum of moviegoers. (NKB)</span></p> <p><span>JOHNSON FAMILY VACATION</span></p> <p><span>Take another trip with this update on the Chevy Chase vacation saga. Cedric the Entertainer is the patriarch of an adorably wacky family\u2014which features the no longer lil\u2019 Bow Wow\u2014traveling cross-country for a family reunion. Watch as the antics get more and more clich\u00e9d, but enjoy the random bursts of dumb fun, like the hot tub antics with two obese white women and the legitimately humorous guest appearance of frequent Cedric collaborator Steve Harvey as Cedric\u2019s brother. (SAW)</span></p> <p><span>THE LADYKILLERS</span></p> <p><span>The Coen brothers\u2019 limp remake of a classic Alec Guinness comedy has its occasional laughs, but ends up becoming boring in its pursuit of essentially sweet comedy. Tom Hanks is the leader of a gang of robbers forced to masquerade as a band in order to rent church-lady Irma P. Hall\u2019s basement because it connects to the basement of their target. Although the Coens\u2019 affection for southern tradition is sweet and the manic third act brings things up a notch, it isn\u2019t enough to save this essentially mediocre film. (SAW)</span></p> <p><span>THE PUNISHER</span></p> <p><span>Thomas Jane is Frank Castle, a former undercover cop whose family is massacred by Howard Saint (a flamboyant John Travolta) whose son had been killed in one of Castle\u2019s undercover operations. In return, Castle seeks what he says \u201cisn\u2019t revenge. This is punishment.\u201d Watch as Saint\u2019s minions are brutalized in a variety of intriguing fashions with a Guns and Ammo fetishist\u2019s dream array of tools. Often though, this revenge flick is a bit too strong for genre tourists, just for those who have come to stay. (SAW)</span></p> <p><span>THE UNITED STATES OF LELAND</span></p> <p><span>Seemingly intelligent high school student Leland P. Fitzgerald (Ryan Gosling) has just killed an autistic boy for no clear reason. In juvenile hall, he has to come to terms with what he has done. Outside, his alcoholic father (Kevin Spacey), his girlfriend (Jena Malone) and others in the community grapple with the repercussions of this terrible act of violence. What does it mean for their community? Although many critics have mocked the film as a now predictable execration of the darkness behind modern suburbia, in this time of school shootings and anti-depressants, Leland at least stands out as an interesting and intentionally boundary pushing work. (SAW)</span></p> <p><span>THE WHOLE TEN YARDS</span></p> <p><span>For those three people that demanded it, the stars of The Whole Nine Yards reunited for even more even staler neurotic assassin jokes.

{"title": "10,000 Dollars, 10,000 Hours | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Despite what some conservatives would have you believe, Harvard is not the only campus in America that will vote Democratic this fall. According to the latest Institute of Politics (IOP) survey, Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., leads President Bush by 10 points among college students nationwide, even with Ralph Nader factored into the race\u2014significantly better for Kerry than national polls which show the race at a dead heat. And this is in spite of the fact that college students nationwide have similar views to all Americans on the general direction of the country, the war in Iraq and favorable/unfavorable ratings of Bush and Kerry. Harvard Democrats are not alone in our desire for more progressive leadership in Washington.</span></p> <p><span>Beyond the horse-race, the survey illustrates deeper trends, which highlight a strong sense of social justice among today\u2019s college students. College students are more progressive (dare I say liberal?) than their parents. In fact, 44 percent of college students described themselves as liberal on the survey (compared to 30 percent conservative), which should frighten all Republicans currently using \u201cliberal\u201d as a substitute for a four-letter word. Specifically, college students reject the Bush administration\u2019s divisive social agenda. About 60 percent of those surveyed said they do not believe religious values should play an important role in government and (in striking contrast to their parents) close to the same number support gay marriage. Every generation discards another prejudice and ours is no different. Despite the prejudiced and divisive \u201cdefense of marriage\u201d arguments, we cling to the idea of an America free of prejudice. And right-wing Republicans should remember: the college students of today are the swing voters of tomorrow.</span></p> <p><span>Not only do we reject the politics of social division, but we embrace progressive public policy. According to the survey, an astounding 60 percent of college students nationwide believed that environmental protection should be as high a priority as protecting jobs. An even higher 69 percent said they believe that basic health insurance is a right that the government should provide for those unable to pay. And only 22 percent said they believe that cutting taxes is the best way to create jobs (37 percent disagreed). By no means, however, are we looking for handouts. Forty-six percent disagreed with the statement that hard work doesn\u2019t generally bring success by itself (29 percent agreed). We believe in real opportunity and real fairness and we\u2019re not afraid to work for it.</span></p> <p><span>The Democratic Party has connected with college students across this nation, and for all the right reasons. Sixty-six percent of college students said they believe issues are most important in choosing a leader, in contrast to 52 percent of all voters, a figure which includes their supposedly more mature parents. We care and we will vote Democratic. The 2004 election will be the most important one of our young lives. It is often said that there are few swing voters; the only swing factor is whether they vote or not. If this is the case, college students could be an important swing bloc in the Democrats\u2019 favor. Apathy and cynicism are no longer excuses for not voting in an age where our rights vanish before our eyes, deficits rise that we will inevitably pay and leaders lie to our face. No one is going to give us anything; voting is the only way we will gain political respect.</span></p> <p><span>Not only are we College Democrats numerous, but we are also energized. An unprecedented number of young people became involved in the primary campaign this cycle, not only volunteering for their favorite candidates, but also giving money and utilizing their social networks. This energy can only increase now that we have a nominee, John Kerry, to rally behind. Kerry is a veteran who has the experience to lead and the integrity to restore faith in our government. And Kerry will require of young people what President Bush did not have the courage to do after Sept. 11, 2001: ask for sacrifice. His \u201cService for College\u201d plan will provide either full tuition or financial assistance to over 500,000 college students in return for national service such as tutoring young and/or underprivileged children, environmental cleanup and homeland defense. Kerry will also work with our allies to bring peace to Iraq, and repeal Bush\u2019s tax cuts for the wealthiest so we can afford universal health care and real homeland security.</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately, these dreams cannot become reality until we tell the current occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.\u2014in the words of Donald Trump\u2014\u201cYou\u2019re fired!\u201d President Bush enjoys the benefits of incumbency\u2014fundraising ability and a readily-available bully pulpit. He has also utilized the politics of fear, making Americans believe (wrongly) that only he can safeguard them against the evils of terror. While this is despicable and the lowest form of politics, generally reserved for totalitarian regimes, it is also extremely effective. We Democrats need to fight back. We need to send the message loud and clear that we are patriots and want our country back from the corporations and right-wing nuts.</span></p> <p><span>In order to send this message, we need two things: money and manpower. That is why the Harvard College Democrats have set a goal for \u201c10,000 Dollars, 10,000 Hours.\u201d By the end of the campaign on Nov. 2, Harvard students will raise $10,000 and give 10,000 hours of their time to defeating Bush, electing John Kerry and moving our country forward. I challenge every Harvard student who cares about his or her country to give, at minimum, $10 of his or her money and 10 hours of his or her time to phone bank, canvass in New Hampshire or volunteer on a political campaign in the summer. Together, and only together, we can move America forward. The Harvard College Democrats have already knocked on nearly 250 Harvard doors, but we need your help. Go to our website, www.HarvardDems.com, to sign up for our campaign effort and give money to Kerry. The recent survey has confirmed what we knew all along\u2014we Harvard Democrats are not alone. Let us make our presence felt.</span></p> <p><span><i>Andy J.

{"title": "Students Push For Voters\u2019 Rights | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>While many campus politicos will spend the next eight months trying to get out the vote in anticipation of the upcoming presidential election, two students at Harvard Law School (HLS) have vowed to make sure voters aren\u2019t turned away once they arrive at the polls.</span></p> <p><span>The students\u2019 fledgling voter-rights effort, Just Democracy, aims to send as many as 2,000 law student volunteers to monitor \u201chigh-risk\u201d polling places across the nation on Nov. 2. The group\u2019s founders said the volunteers will offer checklists, knowledge of the law and access to legal hotlines to prevent poll workers from mistakenly turning away enfranchised citizens on election day.</span></p> <p><span>Just Democracy co-founder Micah B. May, a second-year law student, said many voters encounter polling places that lack handicap access or bilingual ballots. He also said eligible voters are sometimes turned away after being mistaken for unregistered voters or convicted felons who have lost their right to vote.</span></p> <p><span>Citing a recent study by the Caltech-MIT Voting Technology Project, May and Rebecca O\u2019Brien, a second-year law student and the group\u2019s other founder, said that headline-grabbing disputes over recounts in the 2000 election paled in comparison to the problem of widespread disenfranchisement.</span></p> <p><span>According to that 2001 study, between 4 million and 6 million eligible voters were wrongly excluded from the polls in 2000, when 537 votes in Florida tipped the Electoral College to President Bush.</span></p> <p><span>Supporters said the new initiative is designed to prevent such problems from recurring.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cImagine what would have happened if they had been there in Florida at the</span></p> <p><span>time,\u201d said Assistant Professor of Law Heather K. Gerken, who has advised May and O\u2019Brien. \u201cIf they had been there to help counsel people who were wrongly turned away or intimidated, it might have made a difference\u2014and this election is looking to be as close as that one.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><b>EARLY RETURNS</b></span></p> <p><span>Rep. Katherine Harris, R-Fla.\u2014the former Florida secretary of state who stepped onto the national stage after overseeing the state\u2019s 2000 recount\u2014guardedly praised the new effort in a statement e-mailed to The Crimson yesterday.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhile reports about the 2000 presidential election in Florida wildly and irresponsibly exaggerated the number of qualified voters who were turned away at the polls...we must not tolerate even one wrongful denial of this precious right,\u201d Harris wrote. \u201cThus, I commend the stated aims of Just Democracy.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>May said simple human error, more than intentional malfeasance, leads to voters being turned away in U.S. elections.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere are occasionally malicious attempts to disenfranchise voters, but the vast majority of problems arise from bureaucratic ineptitude,\u201d May said. \u201cIt\u2019s expensive and hard to run an election.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Leslie Reynolds, executive director of the National Association of Secretaries of State, said chronic understaffing makes running the polls difficult.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhat would help more\u2014if they got a thousand people to actually work the polling places,\u201d Reynolds said. \u201cThe best way to make sure people aren\u2019t disenfranchised is to become part of the process rather than watching the process.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>She said the Help America Vote Act of 2002, which takes effect for the first time this year, should help avoid the pitfalls that have plagued past elections. The act allows voters who are challenged at the polls to fill out provisional ballots that may later be deemed eligible. It also requires that states move from nationwide to statewide voting rolls, which Reynolds said should be more accurate.</span></p> <p><span>But Gerken dismissed the act as \u201ctoothless,\u201d saying it provides \u201cincentives\u201d rather than strict orders.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere is no federal mandate to ensure that the problems in Florida don\u2019t happen again,\u201d she said.</span></p> <p><span>Tyler Professor of Constitutional Law Laurence H. Tribe \u201962, who helped write the legal briefs for the recount appeal of former Vice President Al Gore \u201969, said that it is critical to address voting irregularities as soon as possible.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cSometimes elections are essentially showpieces for democracy, and when you peel back the top layer, you discover some pretty ugly truths underneath,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span><b>JUST STARTING</b></span></p> <p><span>Just Democracy\u2019s founders acknowledged that they face a wide range of difficulties on the way to the ambitious goal of guarding the nation\u2019s elections.</span></p> <p><span>The group has pledged to distinguish itself as a neutral observer of a process that has often sparked partisan acrimony in the past. But despite actively recruiting volunteers from all parts of the political spectrum, May and O\u2019Brien said staying free of bias would be no easy task.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt is a challenge for us to maintain a coalition of people whose politics may differ widely on many issues in American life,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in the law that\u2019s not political, including those questions.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The founders also noted their relative inexperience with electoral law. O\u2019Brien, who has not taken Gerken\u2019s course on the subject, said she is \u201ca total novice in this area of the law.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The pair must figure out exactly how Just Democracy\u2019s volunteers will operate, especially in those states with particularly stringent laws preventing observers from interacting with voters.</span></p> <p><span>Tribe said that to sort this out and to anticipate other voting irregularities, the group has no time to lose.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis is really work that needs to be done before election day,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Just Democracy will be most successful if it employs a \u201cprophylactic strategy\u201d in advance of an electoral crisis, according to Reynolds.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe key to elections is nobody likes a recount,\u201d she said. \u201cJudges are much more likely to issue a remedy before the election.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>To prepare for November, the group will place an emphasis on attracting a wide base of support, May said. It has already recruited volunteers from Harvard Business School and the Kennedy School of Government in addition to HLS, he said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe number of law students we\u2019re hoping to get can make a big difference,\u201d he said. \u201cNo, we\u2019re not going to be able to prevent every voting problem that happens, but I think we\u2019re going to be able to make a big dent.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>May said Just Democracy hopes to have 2,000 volunteers working out of 50 or more chapters at law schools around the country by the time polls open in November. In order to finance this expansion, he said the group hopes to court corporate sponsorship as well as funds from the legal community.</span></p> <p><span>For now, though, the group has confirmed chapters at only 10 schools, including New York University, Stanford University and the University of Chicago. And it has yet to determine a definite list of \u201chigh-risk\u201d polling areas where volunteers will focus their efforts.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe\u2019re definitely still in outreach mode,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.</span></p> <p><span>O\u2019Brien said the project had its genesis at a recent Law School panel on voter participation, where a panelist suggested the idea. O\u2019Brien raised the idea with electoral scholar Gerken in late January, she said, and later discussed it with Tribe, who teaches the course on constitutional law that both she and May are currently taking.</span></p> <p><span>By the beginning of this month, O\u2019Brien said she had turned to \u201cgood old-fashioned viral marketing\u201d to disseminate the Just Democracy idea to other schools via e-mail.</span></p> <p><span>As more and more law schools open up chapters, O\u2019Brien said she hopes a \u201clean,\u201d decentralized structure of student leaders trained in local voting law will be prepared to organize thousands of volunteers come November.</span></p> <p><span>May and O\u2019Brien said they hope to set up a conference of volunteers at Harvard this fall to prepare for the election and provide basic training in the complexities of voting law and its implementation.</span></p> <p><span>By election day, they said they intend to facilitate Just Democracy chapters in 49 of the 50 states, with the exception of Alaska, which they said lacks a law school. But May expressed optimism at rumors of a law school opening in that state next semester.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMaybe we\u2019ll get in on the ground floor there,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff writer Stephen M.

Roy Moore, then the chief justice of the Alabama supreme court, refused to comply with Thompson\u2019s order.</span></p> <p><span>Pryor then filed an ethics complaint against Moore last year, resulting in a unanimous decision by the Alabama judicial ethics panel to remove Moore from office.</span></p> <p><span>Pryor said Friday that Moore, in defying a court order, had neglected the duties of his judgeship.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cJudges, of all, have an obligation to respect the law even when they disagree with it,\u201d Pryor said.</span></p> <p><span>At the time, Moore said he was being removed from office because he \u201cacknowledged God.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But Pryor said Friday that consideration of religion should not prevent a judge from respecting the law.</span></p> <p><span>Pryor cited the Bible extensively to defend his stance.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cNowhere in the Scriptures does Jesus mention that a monument to the Ten Commandments [must] be displayed in a public courthouse,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Pryor said that he and Moore\u2014who are both Republicans\u2014agree that the monument was constitutional.

{"title": "Prudes and Puritans | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The American Right Wing is not comfortable with the female form.  So we were reminded last week, when Federal Communications Commission Chairman Michael Powell voiced his horror at the half-second exposure of Janet Jackson\u2019s famous right breast during the Super Bowl.  While Americans everywhere combed the internet for a closer look and set a new record for \u201cmost-Tivo-ed moment ever,\u201d Powell expressed his outrage at a press conference.  In language at least as harsh as that used by his father to describe Saddam Hussein, Powell described the incident as \u201cdeplorable\u201d and vowed a \u201cthorough and swift\u201d federal investigation into\u2026 into what exactly?  Justin Timberlake\u2019s intentions?  If only the administration were this eager to investigate 9/11, that commission they keep stonewalling would be releasing its report by now instead of begging for more time and cooperation.</span></p> <p><span>It\u2019s hardly the first time this administration has suffered from unease at the drop of a nipple.  It was almost exactly two years ago when John Ashcroft ordered the Justice Department to cover the exposed breast of a statue in the lobby of the Department\u2019s Washington office building, at a cost of $8,000.  At the time, some remarked on how this reminded them of other religious zealots who took offense to nudity and to statues\u2014the Taliban came to mind, though in all fairness they preferred blowing up statues to covering them\u2014while others, such as Al Franken, pointed out that another possible use of the money might be more urgent: fighting terrorism.</span></p> <p><span>It seems odd that an infant is supposed to feed on them, and a grown man is expected at some point to behold them, but for a period in between we feel the need to see to it that no child ever sees a breast. This prudishness seems quintessentially American; Europeans, who have long been more comfortable with the human form than we, are generally amused by the Puritan standards of American entertainment when it comes to nudity.  The French, for example, have no trouble with the appearance of topless women, shown routinely in newspapers and advertisements.</span></p> <p><span>Come to think of it, maybe this is why \u201cprotecting\u201d children from breasts is so important to the Right; recent events could point to a correlation between viewing semi-nude female bodies and opposing American invasions in the Middle East.</span></p> <p><span>If we are honest with ourselves, we can\u2019t help but admit that sex is a good thing.  Chances are you want to have kids, and chances are you want your kids, eventually, to have sex too.  Violence, on the other hand, is something none of us want our kids to be involved in. Sex, intrinsically, is a good thing.  The human body, intrinsically, is at least a neutral thing. Violence, we can all agree, is a bad thing.  So why is the refrain of the cultural conservative always a complaint about \u201csex and violence\u201d as if they\u2019re the same thing?  Indeed, not only are the two often conflated, but many on the Right seem more scandalized by sex than by violence. I can\u2019t find Powell on the record being nearly as harsh about violence on TV as he is about Janet Jackson\u2019s curious article of jewelry, or Ashcroft denouncing the countless paintings of violent battle in our government buildings.  In fact, one of the objections to the FCC\u2019s unprecedented deregulation of the airwaves, championed by Powell, is that it contributes to the televisual monopoly of violent trash.  Never mind sex and violence in real life.</span></p> <p><span>Speaking of boobs, remember those Republican House impeachment managers, who feigned outrage at Bill Clinton\u2019s escapades, yet were on the record defending Oliver North\u2019s lies to Congress in the Iran-Contra affair?  Indeed, the asymmetry between the Right\u2019s panicked attitude about sex and its causal stance on violence is reflected in the basic partisan dichotomy of scandal in this country: in our lifetimes, Democratic scandals tend to be sexual, while Republican ones are often violent.  It was in 1984, the year most college sophomores were born, that Gary Hart\u2019s presidential candidacy imploded because it was discovered that he had had an affair.  And, in a formative moment for us all, the nation\u2019s political life ground to a halt while President Clinton was impeached for having obfuscated about his sexual activities to a lawyer in a frivolous sexual harassment suit instigated by his opponents.</span></p> <p><span>The most memorable Republican scandals of our lifetimes, meanwhile, are devoid of sexual excitement, but packed with violence\u2014first in the Reagan administration\u2019s use of Iranian gun money to finance terrorists in Latin America, and now in the emerging scandal over whether we invaded another country on false pretenses furnished by the Bush administration in an apocalyptic effort to sell a pre-fabricated policy.</span></p> <p><span>The scorecard on these scandals is incomplete, but so far it looks like sex is more damaging in the public eye. Clinton got impeached over his almost-criminal prevarications; Reagan faced nothing of the sort for his administration\u2019s highly illegal operations.  Gary Hart was finished as a candidate almost as soon as scandal broke. The jury\u2019s still out on what Mr. Bush knew and didn\u2019t know, how he used it, why he was wrong and whether he will regret his mistakes.</span></p> <p><span>It\u2019s the priorities, stupid.  It\u2019s all well and good to poke fun at Republicans for being prudes and Democrats for being licentious.  But the disconnect present in the ruling Right\u2019s (and it seems, American culture\u2019s) fixation on sex as a horrid scourge, while less attention is paid to more important matters, is deadly serious when people start getting killed over this stuff.</span></p> <p><span>The Left needs to hope for\u2014and, if possible, help\u2014Americans to acknowledge that what happens in the war room (and, for that matter, the board room) is more important than what happens in the bedroom.  Meanwhile, if George W. Bush thinks that just because he isn\u2019t having affairs, he can get away with a presidency full of colossal intelligence failures, disgraceful misdeeds of finance and influence and apparent manipulation of facts in the pursuit of war, then\u2026well, America may just prove him right.</span></p> <p><span><i>Peter P.M.

{"title": "Look Busy, Do Nothing | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>It\u2019s getting to seem like you can\u2019t listen to analysis of this year\u2019s presidential field without hearing the same tiresome comparison of the Democratic and Republican parties\u2019 strengths: Democrats are strong on domestic issues, they say, but Republicans are strong on foreign policy. In this framework, for a Democrat to win he would need to keep the focus of the race on issues like jobs, the economy and Social Security. And if President Bush wants to be reelected, he\u2019ll have to remind people that he\u2019s \u201ctough on terrorism.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Bush certainly knows how to look busy when it comes to defending the homeland, and his administration\u2019s commitment to the War on Terror is almost never questioned. Just peruse the list: invading Afghanistan, invading Iraq, setting up military tribunals to try suspected terrorists, dramatically increasing the Justice Department\u2019s surveillance authority, holding suspected terrorists without charges or access to a lawyer, slowing down the process of issuing visas to students and visitors, requiring people from \u201cproblem\u201d countries to register their pictures and fingerprints with the Department of Homeland Security and so on. A list that long has got to mean that they\u2019re really busy. And if they\u2019re busy, then they must be doing a lot to keep us safe, right?</span></p> <p><span>But as is so often the case with the Bush administration, there\u2019s much less there than meets the eye. Bush\u2019s flagship efforts in the War on Terror have undeniably been his two traditional nation-on-nation wars\u2014in Afghanistan and Iraq. How have they made us safer? Well, Afghanistan is probably the more successful of the two, considering that (unlike Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime) the Taliban was actually giving material support to al Qaeda, and is now no longer in a position to do so. But how long will that last? Bush\u2019s philosophical aversion to nation-building, which he announced during the presidential debate of October 11, 2000, has so far prevented him from committing the necessary amounts of troops or reconstruction money to the war-torn nation. November\u2019s $87 billion appropriation to \u201cfight terrorism\u201d in Afghanistan and Iraq earmarked a mere $1.2 billion for Afghan reconstruction (with another $10 billion for continued military operations there), and the measly deployment of American peacekeepers in Afghanistan means that the country is being run mostly by local warlords and drug-runners. And to top it all off, al Qaeda may no longer be the official guest of the Afghan government, but it nevertheless has a continued presence in the southeastern provinces along the border with Pakistan. Of course, it goes without saying that Osama bin Laden remains at large (ignoring the popular conspiracy theory that we\u2019ve already captured him and Bush is waiting to reveal that in November).</span></p> <p><span>What about Iraq? Bush never demonstrated any convincing link between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda, and his own weapons inspector now says Iraq probably didn\u2019t have the weapons we were led to believe it had. But put that aside. It\u2019s clear just from looking at the number of Americans killed so far\u2014more than 500, with many more wounded\u2014that the war in Iraq has been a bigger threat to Americans\u2019 safety than any terrorist attack against us except September 11 itself. And what kind of a future is Bush\u2019s unprovoked invasion of Iraq creating? One in which reasonable people, not just terrorists, can argue that the United States is an aggressive, dominating power; one in which sectarian rivalries and historical forces we can hardly predict pull Iraq towards potential civil war or Islamic revolution; one in which terrorists have a new target and a renewed cause.</span></p> <p><span>And the rest of the Bush War on Terror? Why did Bush\u2019s Congress spend $8.5 million of the $87 billion Iraq and Afghanistan appropriation on security for November\u2019s Free Trade Area of the Americas talks in Miami? That money, theoretically intended to further his \u201ctough on terrorism\u201d agenda, instead financed the silencing and imprisonment of dozens of non-violent protestors who dared to take issue with his politics.</span></p> <p><span>So yes, the Bush administration is doing a lot in the name of fighting terrorism. Invading Iraq was undoubtedly a big deal. The same with Afghanistan. And removing our civil liberties is a big deal too. But just because they look busy, it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re actually doing anything to make us safer. Next time you hear someone characterize Bush as weak on the economy and strong on defense, take a second to look past the spin.</span></p> <p><span><i>Thomas D.

{"title": "One Voice Among Many | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>For the United States, promoting democracy in Iran these days is no easy task. Push too hard for the reformists and America risks making Iran\u2019s democracy advocates look beholden to America. Speak up too much and the budding democratic movement in Iran might fail. Yet doing nothing is an unacceptable alternative\u2014simply neglecting the situation affronts America\u2019s fundamental democratic beliefs.</span></p> <p><span>Now that Iran\u2019s Guardian Council has kicked more than 2000 reformist candidates off the ballot for this month\u2019s parliamentary elections, this bind between sticking to ideals and satisfying the demands of pragmatism is even more acute. Such a flagrant disregard for the democratic process should not go unchecked. But the U.S. cannot stand alone and expect to do any good; America\u2019s voice should be one of many objecting to Iran\u2019s anti-democratic behavior. President Bush should leave his undue pride on the doorstep and approach the United Nations to pass a resolution condemning the Guardian Council\u2019s actions.</span></p> <p><span>There are two reasons to go to the U.N. First, it would help the message. After Bush identified Iran as a part of the Axis of Evil during last year\u2019s State of the Union Address, it is not surprising that many Iranians dislike the United States. The president\u2019s unnecessarily overblown talk of American crusades against Islamic terrorism didn\u2019t help, either. A Security Council declaration condemning Iran\u2019s Guardian Council might get the message across to a few Iranians that would otherwise have blown off a purely American objection. Second, going to the U.N. would also help the United States regain a little of its credibility lost after the Iraq war. Bush should be trying to buck the image of the go-it-alone cowboy and demonstrate that he has at least the capacity to be a team player.</span></p> <p><span>But a Security Council resolution could easily get passed off as just empty words. So it is up to the Bush administration to pull whatever diplomatic strings it can to help the reformists. The Bush administration has productively exerted pressure before, helping the International Atomic Energy Agency get inspectors into Iran to monitor the regime\u2019s weapons program last year, for instance. The United States should also use diplomatic channels to encourage the European community to exploit the economic leverage it has over Iran. European countries such as France, Germany and even Russia have a lot more they can threaten to take away from Iran if the theocrats continue to stifle the democratic movement. Indeed, Russia has assisted in the construction of a nuclear reactor in northern Iran; the prospect of losing that help just might get the Guardian Council\u2019s attention.</span></p> <p><span>The last thing President Bush should do is use the kind of loudmouth language that has distinguished his rhetoric about Iran and Iraq in the past. More on the Axis of Evil won\u2019t help us, and it certainly won\u2019t help Iran\u2019s reformists. In this case, we hope that the president will take a hint from his own campaign plank in 2000\u2014that the United States should be proud, yet humble.</span></p>"}

In short, he described the mission as determining \u201cwhere are we as a people, at the dawn of the twenty-first century.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>From May through July of 2002, Gates traveled to four disparate regions of the United States\u2014the deep South, Chicago\u2019s inner-city, the East and Los Angeles\u2014in search of a representative sample of the black community that, collectively, could provide an answer to this question.</span></p> <p><span>In addition to meeting with respected leaders and celebrities such as Colin Powell, Quincy Jones, Maya Angelou, Morgan Freeman, Alicia Keys, Chris Tucker and Jesse Jackson, Gates also interviewed the not-so-famous, such as Army Sergeant Major Kenneth Wilcox, based at Fort Benning in Georgia, and Kalais Chiron Hunt (a.k.a. Eric Edwards), a prisoner in Chicago\u2019s Cook County Jail.</span></p> <p><span>Through his dialogues with African Americans, Gates\u2014in the style of renowned oral historian Studs Terkel\u2014connects with his interviewees and earns their trust. As a result, he is able to access a wealth of information about how far the black community has come since King\u2019s murder, how far his people still need to go and, more importantly, how they can get closer to the \u201cpromised land.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In a recent interview with The Crimson, Gates, who was in Los Angeles in January on the sixth stop in his seven-city book tour, opens up about the book, the documentaries and the future of African-Americans.</span></p> <p><span>Gates begins by describing how he celebrated Martin Luther King Jr. Day the week before.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI spent time with my daughters, both of whom live in Brooklyn,\u201d Gates says. \u201cAnd I also watched King documentaries all day and listened to him on the radio. Wherever I was, I was hearing those tapes of Martin Luther King, and I still get gooseflesh when I hear them and I still get tears in my eyes when I hear the \u2018I\u2019ve Been to the Mountaintop\u2019 speech.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Beginning to talk about his oral history project, Gates explains that \u201cAmerica Beyond the Color Line\u201d is one installment in a three-part story that he is telling about major black populations throughout the world.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cPart one was Africa, part two would be black America, sort of where we were as a people 35 years after the terrible death of Martin Luther King, and part three, which is in development now, would be a series on blacks in Latin America,\u201d Gates says. \u201cSo the triangular trade, as it were: Africa, America, and the Caribbean, Latin America and South America.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Gates says that he chose his interviewees from various educational, professional and socioeconomic backgrounds, who, when taken together, would present a balanced picture of black life in America.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe theme of the book and the series is the class divide within the black community,\u201d Gates says, \u201cand the fact that the black middle class has almost quadrupled since 1968, but the percentage of black children living at or beneath the poverty line is about 40 percent, which is about what it was when Dr. King was killed.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>This paradox has resulted because of affirmative action, Gates says.</span></p> <p><span>On several occasions Gates has said that he firmly supports affirmative action\u2014indeed he benefited greatly from it. He was one of 96 black men and women, the largest such group at the time, to enroll at Yale University in September 1969 as part of what would become known as the affirmative action generation.</span></p> <p><span>However, Gates maintains that the controversial admissions program has created two nations within the African-American community: the educated black middle class and the uneducated black underclass.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAnd so the book and the film series are a wake-up call to white America and black America, to the black middle class, saying, \u2018We\u2019ve come this far by faith,\u2019 as the black spiritual goes, \u2018but this is not far enough,\u2019\u201d Gates says. \u201cAnd a wake-up call to America as a whole. Black poverty is costing us billions and billions of dollars in welfare, prison costs, the general cost of despair and that we need to do something systemic about it just like the black community needs to do something systemic about it.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><b>The Color Line</b></span></p> <p><span>At the turn of the century, Gates says, DuBois asked, \u201cWhat will be the problem of the 20th century?\u201d He concluded that the problem would be that of the color line.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI wanted to ask a wide cross-section of black America, \u2018What would be the problem of the 21st century?\u2019\u201d Gates says. \u201cAll people talked about was, as Vernon Jordan put it, \u2018the money,\u2019 it was all about the money, it was about economic relationships. So that was very curious to me, very fascinating.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cBlack people, like everybody else, are concerned about economics. And our goal has to be to change the class distribution within the black community. We have too few people in the middle class and too many people in the under class,\u201d he says. Gates says America needs a class distribution system in which most people fall into the middle class, the percentage of the black poor equals the percentage of the white poor, the percentage of the black wealthy equals the percentage of the white wealthy and the percentage of blacks in the middle class equals the percentage of whites in the middle class.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAnd we are, believe me, a long way from that outcome,\u201d Gates says.</span></p> <p><span>In order to elevate the black under class, Gates believes that a federal jobs program and a Marshall plan for the cities must be adopted.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe need to give people hope in the system again so they have a good education, stable learning environment, real jobs for a 21st century, highly technological global economy,\u201d Gates says.</span></p> <p><span>He adds, \u201cBut on the other hand, we need a revolution of attitudes within the black community. No white racist makes you get pregnant when you\u2019re 16, no white racist makes you drop out of school, no white racist makes you not do your homework. Far too many of our values are associated with the bling-bling. No deferred gratification. And this is a horrible outcome.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In his interview with Gates, the comedian Bernie Mac expresses some of the same concerns.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cOur mentality, and not just blacks, but a lot of minorities, has fallen,\u201d Mac says. \u201cIt has fallen from where we were. The spiritual guidance has gone and left us, for number one, and that\u2019s a very dangerous thing. And the mentality in terms of microwaves has risen. We want things overnight. It\u2019s a fast-food, instant-gratification, efficiency-not-quality society.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Gates says that wasn\u2019t the way it was when he was growing up in the 1950s.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cEducation was the blackest value of all. Getting an education was defeating white racists,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>There is a knock at the door of Gates' hotel room. He puts the phone down for a moment. When he returns, he reports that he was making arrangements to have his suit pressed because \"I gotta look clean.\" He laughs and explains that he is appearing on HBO\u2019s \u201cDennis Miller Live.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cSchwarzenegger\u2019s on tonight. I\u2019m on tomorrow,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>Talk changes quickly to politics. Who does he predict will win the Democratic nomination?</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think Kerry and Edwards. We\u2019ll see if I\u2019m right,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>Back to the subject of education, Gates says people today do not have their priorities straight.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cSomething\u2019s happening to our community, when far too many people think it's easier to be a basketball player than a doctor, and that\u2019s not true,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are far more black doctors than black athletes, but we\u2019ve lost our way. The black middle class is perpetuating itself, but the black underclass is perpetuating itself. Some of this is caused by historical forces like institutional racism. But some of it is caused by behavioral problems, and we need to return to our traditional values.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><b>People Person</b></span></p> <p><span>Gates is a self-described people person.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI love meeting people and I love interviewing people,\u201d he says. Of the 44 interviews which he conducted, Gates says his conversations with Chris Tucker and Mac were the most fun.</span></p> <p><span>The most moving interviews he says, were done with the prisoner Eric Edwards and the Massenbergs, a family living in the notoriously crime-ridden Robert Taylor Homes in Chicago\u2019s South Side. \u201cThey were so extraordinarily articulate about the forces arrayed against them in the inner city that I learned so much and I was very deeply moved,\u201d Gates says.</span></p> <p><span>The interview with Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan proved to be the most enlightening, Gates says. Milchan told Gates that if the 2002 movie Panic Room, which starred Jodie Foster and grossed $100 million at the box office, had starred Halle Berry, it would have made half as much money. According to Milchan, the reason for this disparity would be that white people are \u201cnot interested in watching a black woman and her son being terrorized by burglars.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Milchan also said, according to Gates, that a love story starring Denzel Washington and Halle Berry would never be made because both actors demand $20 million to appear on set, and the film would only make $50 million because \u201cwhite people aren\u2019t interested in watching black people fall in love and make love.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"But if it were Russell Crowe and Halle Berry, it would make $200 million, maybe $300 million,\u201d Gates reports. \u201cIt\u2019s astonishing. And [Milchan] was just very honest and graphic about it.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><b>Best of Times, Worst of Times</b></span></p> <p><span>Gates says he is both pleased and disturbed by what he learned on his journey through black America.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s the best of times, it\u2019s the worst of times,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the best of times because the middle class is doing so well. It does me proud to see Colin Powell as Secretary of State or Condi Rice as National Security Advisor.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cBut on the other hand, we have so many of our people stuck behind in the ghetto of despair,\u201d Gates says. \u201cAnd it made me sad and want to embark upon a campaign to restore the value of education to our people, and a campaign for a revolution in attitudes.\"</span></p> <p><span>\u201cBlack people need to vote, we need to stay in school, we need to do our homework, we need to graduate,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>During any given week, only 45 percent of black people in Chicago are gainfully employed, according to Gates.</span></p> <p><span>He says part of the problem stems from historical forces such as institutional racism, though personal choices also contribute to the phenomenon.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cBut simultaneously we have too many of our people who have internalized their own oppression. They\u2019re having babies in their teens, they\u2019re dropping out of school. They\u2019re not deferring gratification. All those elements combined with a few more devastate the economic fabric of a community. And we can\u2019t wait for Abraham Lincoln to come riding down the street on a white horse to save us anymore,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>Blacks need after-school programs based on institutions like Hebrew school, for example, in which the traditions and customs of a people are taught in a safe haven, Gates says.</span></p> <p><span>In fact, he and former Carswell Professor of Philosophy K. Anthony Appiah started the Martin Luther King after-school program in Roxbury. The program teaches computer skills and black history using Encarta Africana, which Gates and Appiah developed together.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf Jewish people had waited for gentiles to stop being anti-Semitic, there wouldn\u2019t be Jewish people,\u201d Gates declares.</span></p> <p><span>***</span></p> <p><span>Gates has done much for the African-American community, yet he remains humble about the role he has played. When asked if he considers himself an activist, Gates replies with a chuckle, \u201cI consider myself a little country professor.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cNo, I\u2019m primarily a scholar,\u201d he continues. \u201cThe reason I went into this business, the reason I pursued a career as a professor, is that I love to read and write books.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cBut inevitably, my work has taken me along certain more, let\u2019s say, activist paths than my colleagues in the English department. Because I have a social concern about the status of black Americans,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I know how much I benefited from the Civil Rights Movement and affirmative action, and to see the progress of our people arrested by this class divide, which could very well be permanent, makes me deeply and profoundly sad, and I want to be at least one voice in trying to reverse that pattern.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff writer Andrew C.

{"title": "Mac the Knife | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Growing up, I\u2019ve often lamented that I missed out on the zeitgeist of the 1960s. For better or worse, I think I might have enjoyed the frothy exuberance and moral drama.  As an undergraduate in the early 1990s, I even once wrote a fairly maudlin poem that listed all of the things I\u2019d like to have done if I had been alive then. It included such items as looking forward to the next Beatles album, sneaking a sophomore out of her dormitory window after curfew, sitting around the television with my family when Neil Armstrong walked on the moon...and heckling Robert S. McNamara.</span></p> <p><span>I might have had a chance to finally do the latter last Wednesday night, when the former secretary of defense appeared at the Kennedy School of Government to discuss film clips from Errol Morris\u2019 documentary, <i>The Fog of War</i>.  Unfortunately, I arrived just a moment too late to get a seat in the auditorium; the most I could do was watch the video feed from the overflow room.  This made the whole occasion seem even more surreal.  Robert McNamara\u2014debonair, genial and still very lucid at age 87\u2014sat just a room away, before 700 members of the Harvard community, who, The Crimson reported, \u201creceived him with courteous applause.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>That was a mistake.</span></p> <p><span>Robert McNamara is a <i>war criminal.</i>  We need not quibble about this.  By his own, well-publicized admission, during World War II both he and General Curtis E. LeMay \u201cwere behaving as war criminals\u201d when they incinerated hundreds of thousands of Japanese civilians in massive firebombing raids.  If not for the Allied victory, an international war crimes tribunal might have recommended that McNamara be blindfolded and shot.  Instead, he got a promotion.</span></p> <p><span>During the eight years that McNamara served as secretary of defense, he helped mastermind the killing of hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese, many of them civilians. Fragmentation bombs, napalm and the chemical weapon Agent Orange were all used to devastating effect.  By the time the war ended, at least 2 million Vietnamese had been slaughtered.  As McNamara helpfully reminded the Kennedy School crowd, if the U.S. population had suffered an equivalent percentage of losses during that war, 27 million Americans would have been killed.  According to the Nuremberg Principles, war crimes include the \u201cwanton destruction of cities, towns or villages, or devastation not justified by military necessity.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Unlike other famous war criminals, McNamara has never tried to deny that he knew about the carnage that was happening under his watch.  In a 1967 memo to President Lyndon B. Johnson, he betrayed his discomfiture with his own policy recommendations when he said \u201cthere may be a limit beyond which\u2026much of the world may not permit us to go.\u201d  With chilling understatement, he continued: \u201cThe picture of the world\u2019s greatest superpower killing or seriously injuring 1,000 noncombatants a week, while trying to pound a tiny, backward nation into submission on an issue whose merits are hotly disputed, is not a pretty one.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>How, then, did McNamara rationalize his actions?  \u201cI just felt that I was serving at the request of the president, who had been elected by the American people,\u201d he says in <i>The Fog of War</i>.  \u201cAnd it was my responsibility to help him carry out the office as he believed was in the interest of our people.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>McNamara continued to just follow orders even after he\u2019d privately concluded that the Vietnam War could not be won.  He also lied repeatedly to Congress about the war.  Owing to some absurd genteel code (apparently known only to himself), McNamara argues today that it\u2019s \u201cirresponsible for an ex-Secretary of Defense to comment\u2026about a president who is in the midst of war\u2026 \u201d   But even this is a prevarication. At the Kennedy School, McNamara made no secret of his disapproval of President Bush\u2019s foreign policy, and he recently told Toronto\u2019s Globe and Mail  that, \u201cIt\u2019s just wrong what we\u2019re doing [in Iraq].  It\u2019s morally wrong, it\u2019s politically wrong, it\u2019s economically wrong.\u201d If ex-Secretary of Defense McNamara can criticize President Bush now, why couldn\u2019t he have spoken out against the Vietnam War in 1968, when doing so might have saved hundreds of thousands of lives?</span></p> <p><span>Journalist Mickey Kaus once asked, \u201cHas any single American of [the 20th] century done more harm than Robert McNamara?\u201d  It\u2019s a good question.  Although most of us hold it as an article of faith that war criminals ought to be punished, people generally have a hard time holding their own leaders to the same standards of accountability they demand from others.  McNamara has literally spent his retirement skiing in Aspen and vacationing in Martha\u2019s Vineyard.  It would be more appropriate if he were locked away, and shame on the Harvard community for not telling him so.</span></p> <p><span><i>John C.

{"title": "The New Tune on NCLB | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>If you asked a group of politically-informed college students if they were pleased with President Bush\u2019s main domestic policy item of his term\u2014the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB)\u2014chances are you wouldn\u2019t get a very warm response. Viscerally aware of the party dogma on decentralization, a lot of Republicans have reacted violently to NCLB\u2019s federal mandates; others, the more disconcerting band of Bush cheerleaders, usually give a nod of the head and a coy few words, perhaps a \u201cwell, he tried.\u201d On the Left, NCLB occupies a place on  the official hit list of Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., with the senator\u2019s blithe suggestion of a National Education Trust, a pool of money to fund schools \u201cno questions asked\u201d\u2014in other words, without federal mandates.</span></p> <p><span>The good ol\u2019 boys at the National Education Association (NEA), the largest teacher\u2019s union, love this idea\u2014so much so that they\u2019ve been proposing it for nearly two decades. After what could be remembered by NEA apparatchiks as \u201cthe great betrayal,\u201d when Democrats including Kerry voted for the NCLB\u2019s planks on teacher and school accountability, the nominee-to-be has reversed himself, crudely plagiarizing the NEA\u2019s position papers and taking them as his own plan to \u201cmake sure every child gets the skills they need.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Kerry\u2019s peculiar support of decentralization on education issues can be explained by looking at the NEA\u2019s own political station. It\u2019s an organization that prefers to work in state capitals\u2014while those routinely collectivized under the label \u201cgov jocks\u201d at Harvard might overlook the powerhouse of the NEA in glances at national politics, it\u2019s a good bet that you can find an NEA satellite\u2019s office within three blocks of any state House. And on a community-by-community basis, the same school board system that allows the religious right to hijack school control in the South allows the NEA to do it elsewhere. Most localities in the United States hold separate school trustee and bond elections, meaning far lower voter turnouts\u2014usually between 10 and 20 percent\u2014than the already-disappointing numbers in a statewide or even municipal election. Besides being problematic for those who have utopian visions of the wonders decentralization can do for America\u2019s schools, this syndrome upsets the balance between unionist and administrator with school board candidates relying on union support. It\u2019s as if the AFL-CIO took over a company\u2019s board of directors.</span></p> <p><span>It would be wrong to think of the NEA as the American Medical Association for teachers, one that would assure the teaching credentials of its members or insist on better training. Shirking resemblance to a professional association, the NEA follows the union model forwarded by industrial labor. And for those who never expected Jimmy Hoffa to admonish unionists for lacking pride in the quality of their products, it\u2019s pure fantasy to expect the NEA to pay more attention to the quality of students\u2019 education than teachers\u2019 salaries and benefits packages.</span></p> <p><span>Nonetheless, that\u2019s the tune Dems keep playing. To hear it from the mouth of NEA President Reg Weaver\u2019s public comments, you\u2019d think the NEA was all about education reform, standing up for children and arguing against byzantine labor rules that protect bad teachers and keep good teachers where they are. Weaver has invoked imagery of his union \u201cfighting for children and public education\u201d in nine out of ten of his op-ed pieces by an informal count. Indeed, whenever a word is said against the NEA, or someone questions whether its efforts have anything to do with what America\u2019s typical teacher cares about, the response is unalterably familiar: If you criticize us, you criticize the teachers, children and educational institutions of America.</span></p> <p><span>The NEA\u2019s representation of the majority of American teachers is thus a curious thing. Just a glance at the NEA\u2019s operations might be enough to confirm this: Teachers who want benefits and tenure in most districts must join the NEA; the union has a male-heavy leadership in a profession filled by women; and, more tellingly, the organization has done everything it can to obstruct even basic education reforms on federal and state levels. The union was outraged with NCLB and Democrats, who flocked to support the law after Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, \u201854-\u201956 D-Mass., signed up as a co-sponsor. That was hardly a novel occurrence, though\u2014every six years, when the Elementary and Secondary Education Act\u2019s mandatory reauthorization comes before Congress, it\u2019s the same song and dance. Accountability for failing teachers? No. Incentives for successful educators? Think again. Charter schools? Hardly. Vouchers of any kind? In your dreams. Actually, the only policy the NEA has ever favored on Capitol Hill is a rather straightforward one: Giving more money to the nation\u2019s schools with few or no strings attached\u2014the aforementioned policy that Kerry has recently usurped.</span></p> <p><span>This is the root inspiration for the vogue Democratic criticism of NCLB, not the fact that NCLB is unfunded. Indeed, the Bush administration has increased education spending 35.8 percent since it took office, a boost that accounts for the largest dollar increase of any domestic agency. Likewise, the reason why NCLB is being attacked is not because something went terribly wrong with the implementation of the bill\u2014on the contrary, it\u2019s working exactly as planned, coercing states (with however much disregard for local hardships) to educate children better or forego federal dollars, an idea that the NEA has consistently opposed.</span></p> <p><span>Now, though, it seems that the NEA\u2019s campaign donations\u201495 percent of which go into the hands of Democrats\u2014are paying off. Kerry\u2019s padded renunciation of the law he voted for\u2014including the \u201cNational Education Trust\u201d and the idea of making education reform a recommendation rather than a requirement\u2014is hardly a courageous step for a Democrat and is a telling indicator of the NEA\u2019s hand in the matter.</span></p> <p><span><i>Travis R.

{"title": "Same-Sex Education for Everyone | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>In the three decades since the inception of Title IX, single-sex education has been banished almost entirely to private and parochial schools on the grounds that schools segregated by sex, like those segregated by race, cannot be counted upon to be equal. But last week, President George W. Bush announced plans to change its enforcement of Title IX rules in order to allow more single-sex classes and schools in public school districts. And, though we are concerned about lax enforcement of the Bush Administration\u2019s new rules, we are happy to see families who can\u2019t afford private school getting the same choice that more affluent families have had for generations.</span></p> <p><span>The current body of research on all-boys and all-girls schools is fairly inconclusive. At least some studies, though, have found that boys and girls learn differently and benefit from different methods of teaching. These studies claim, among other things, that single-sex schools are more orderly and that girls in same-sex schools in particular thrive in math, science, social situations and sports relative to their coed counterparts.</span></p> <p><span>But while the effects of single-sex schooling are not entirely clear, there is a huge demand for it. Many of those already open have long waiting lists, and the national number of such public schools has more than doubled\u2014to 24\u2014in the last 18 months. Single-sex education also continues to be popular for non-public schools nationwide. The old Title IX regulations, however, only allowed families with the means to send their children to same-sex private schools; everyone else had to put up with a government-enforced notion of political correctness.</span></p> <p><span>The Bush plan, as stated, would alleviate this disparity without forcing same-sex schools on anyone; in no case would students lose the right to attend a coed school. School districts would also have to ensure that their all-boys and all-girls schools and classes are \u201csubstantially equal\u201d between genders.</span></p> <p><span>Providing these options to all American families is surely a good thing. But there is still room for disaster, and that is why it is essential that this equality clause be stringently enforced. The choice between single-sex and coed schools must remain a choice. One sex must not be allowed to receive an inferior education to the other. The Bush plan would look much less attractive if, for example, the only good school in a district was for girls, leaving boys with no good choices and girls who wanted a decent education without a viable coed option. We hope an administration that so often fails to deliver on its promises can manage to get this one straight.</span></p> <p><span>Nonetheless, President Bush has made a promising move toward greater opportunity for public school students, without having to throw enormous amounts of additional money at the problem. America\u2019s public schools should strive to provide the same opportunities as their private and parochial counterparts. If properly implemented, Bush\u2019s plan can be a large step in that direction.</span></p>"}

Keel \u201904, who attended the event, said, \u201cExit polls show that people who voted for Nader wouldn\u2019t have voted for Gore anyway. People have the misconception that Nader cost Gore the 2000 election. Much of this is propaganda generated by the Democratic Party.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Several campus Democrats interviewed yesterday disagreed, saying they believed that Nader had cost the Democrats the election.</span></p> <p><span>And they added that Nader would not do the same in 2004.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think that a lot of people are now drawn to the Democrats because we have seen what happens when a radical administration, like the Bush administration, takes hold,\u201d said Andy J.

My support for him is based on my belief in the need to get rid of the stranglehold on politics in this country,\u201d Potter said.</span></p> <p><span>When asked if they would vote for Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., in 2004 if Nader decided to end his bid, the Nader supporters unanimously answered no.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere is no way I would vote for Kerry. He supported the war in Iraq.

Stern declared Dean the SEIU\u2019s choice.</span></p> <p><span>Iscayau has pictures of herself with all of the Democratic contenders who spoke at the convention, including Dean, which she has sent to relatives in Guatemala. The SEIU has no problem with non-citizens\u2019 potentially choosing the next U.S. president, Bartley says.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cSEIU is committed to extending and broadening the rights of all immigrant workers in the United States,\u201d he says. \u201cProviding a space for debate and empowerment with respect to the presidential race is one example of that commitment.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The union also asked Iscayau to campaign for Dean in New Jersey, so she spent three days last October canvassing neighborhoods with Spanish speakers. She proudly declares that she convinced three families to switch their registration from Republican to Democrat.</span></p> <p><span>Now that Dean has dropped out of the race, Iscayau has become a Senator John F. Kerry supporter, reasoning that supporting anyone but the front-runner will only \u201csplit the Democrats and help the Republicans.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>According to Bartley, the SEIU will probably endorse Kerry.</span></p> <p><span>\u201c[The SEIU is] stepping back, taking a breather,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d say within another month there will be a new endorsement, but of course members can vote for whoever they want to.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Though as a U.S. resident she was unable to vote in Massachusetts\u2019 primary last week, her only son and his wife voted for Kerry, who won Massachusetts. She says her son, also a custodian at Harvard, is not interested in politics but she pushes him to the polls anyway.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI make him vote,\u201d she says. \u201cNo vote, no voice.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Iscayau says that this may be the year that she finally signs up for U.S. citizenship classes, a requirement to eventually obtaining citizenship.

He doesn\u2019t care about the poor workers.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Iscayau also thinks that Bush\u2019s temporary amnesty proposal for illegal aliens, announced in January by the White House and immediately denounced by critics as an election year ploy to woo Hispanic voters, is a \u201cbad plan.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt gives [illegal workers] amnesty for just two years and they\u2019re under the power of their boss.

{"title": "Dean's Victory | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>In early August, when former Vermont Gov. Howard B. Dean was riding high, a friend who was working with me in Dean\u2019s New Hampshire campaign proposed a scenario. Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., would be the presidential nominee of the Democratic Party. He would appropriate Dean\u2019s rhetoric, imitate his style and walk away with the nomination. John Kerry would win by becoming Howard Dean.</span></p> <p><span>At the time, Kerry\u2019s attempts to imitate Dean\u2019s plain-spoken, hard-hitting style were so ludicrous that my friend\u2019s scenario seemed about as plausible as Ann Coulter stealing the mantle of liberalism and leading the Democrats to the White House. But as Dean has left the race and Kerry wrapped up the nomination, some have started to say that what we joked about in August has actually happened.</span></p> <p><span>Kerry has gotten a lot better on the stump. As much as I hate the phrase \u201cbring it on,\u201d it\u2019s a thousand times more rousing than the patrician senator\u2019s old rallying cry: \u201cWell, this is a nuanced issue, Bob.\u201d He has started to take on Bush far more aggressively than he ever did in the Senate. Listening to him speak these days, I can almost sense passion in his words.</span></p> <p><span>But Dean\u2019s message was more than just rhetoric.</span></p> <p><span>Dean\u2019s obvious passion was an important part of his appeal, but it wasn\u2019t the whole thing. Dean created a new model for political organizing. By taking tough issues head-on and using stark language to portray the differences between Democrats and Republicans, he inspired a movement\u2014a force that could replace political elites and large donors. To understand this political blueprint and its implications, it helps to know Denise Elliott.</span></p> <p><span>Before Jan. 27 of this year, Elliott, who is in her late 30s, had never voted. It wasn\u2019t that she is civically disengaged. As the child-care provider for most of the children in her Nashua, N.H. public housing project, Denise is known and respected by every one of her neighbors. Nor is Denise apathetic. Her face still lights up with righteous anger when anybody mentions the Nashua Public Housing Authority. She can recite from memory the grievances of every one of her neighbors: Pat\u2019s son got cut from Medicaid; Gary can\u2019t get any formula for his daughter; Nicky\u2019s husband has three jobs and she hardly sees him any more.</span></p> <p><span>But for Denise, elections were something that other people did. For decades, she had seen politicians come to Nashua to compete in the New Hampshire primary. They paraded through the affluent North End, traipsed down to Ward 4 for a photo op, then flew off to South Carolina or Michigan or New York.</span></p> <p><span>Dean didn\u2019t compromise with the other side, as if policy issues were just intellectual disputes where reasonable people would naturally disagree. He portrayed policy issues as moral crusades, and he asked his audiences to join him in fighting these battles. The \u201canger\u201d that led some to question Dean\u2019s \u201celectability\u201d convinced Denise, and many others like her, that these causes were worth fighting for.</span></p> <p><span>I met Denise after a neighbor convinced her to get involved in Dean\u2019s campaign. As a Dean staffer, I helped Denise become a Dean organizer in her community by working with her to host an informational meeting in her home. Almost every resident of the 11th Street Project where Denise lived showed up at the meeting. Everybody in the room had a story. Some were about the housing project itself; some were about healthcare; some were about the economy. Most had something to do with the children who were running in and out of the room. After everybody had spoken, I asked who in the room had voted before. One hand shot up. The woman had voted for Clinton in 1992.</span></p> <p><span>Before the polls closed on primary day, when it was already clear that Dean was not going to win the New Hampshire primary, I went back to see Denise.</span></p> <p><span>She had voted, she told me, and so had her neighbors. She had pulled them out of their homes, just as she had pulled them out for her house meeting, and they had all walked the short distance to the polling place together.</span></p> <p><span>Denise created a political community in her neighborhood that had never existed before. The neighbors who met at her house for the Dean meetings have already formed a tenant\u2019s organization in their housing project. Denise guided the group through the complicated municipal system for such organizations. She recruited people to run for leadership positions, facilitated an open election, circulated a petition and planned a community meeting where project residents will present their grievances to the mayor.</span></p> <p><span>Kerry may have taken the fire in Dean\u2019s belly. But to truly capture what made Dean exciting, he must grasp the logic of Dean\u2019s campaign. Dean\u2019s passion built a movement that will last long after the 2004 election. If Kerry is to be worthy of that movement, he must understand why Elliott and others like her gave their time and effort to the Dean campaign.

{"title": "Cells, Embryos and Justice | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>So it turns out Harvard won\u2019t be falling behind in the great stem-cell race after all. Last week, Cabot Professor of the Natural Sciences Douglas A. Melton announced that he and his team have opened 17 new stem-cell lines for research purposes. A local in vitro fertilization (IVF) clinic supplied the cells after extracting them from frozen human embryos.</span></p> <p><span>Ever since a bitter debate over stem-cell research erupted in the summer of 2001, the mainstream press has tended to frame the controversy as a latter-day Scopes Trial\u2014a conflict between religious zealots on one side and proponents of scientific rationalism on the other. And, to be sure, many people\u2019s opposition to such research is an understandable function of their faith. Yet while the media are loath to acknowledge it, there is also a very solid case against stem-cell research based not in religiosity, but in logic and simple moral reasoning.</span></p> <p><span>Let\u2019s return to a first principle: Scientific experimentation is not categorically a public good. The 1932-1972 Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment, for example, in which nearly 400 syphilis-afflicted black Alabamans were unwittingly forced to endure their disease in order to facilitate medical research, remains a terrible blight on the U.S. Public Health Service. The purpose of the study was initially benevolent: trying to curb the raging syphilis epidemic among southern blacks. But its eventual costs in human life were appalling.</span></p> <p><span>Stem-cell research is likewise directed toward the noblest of ends: curing debilitative diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s, Alzheimer\u2019s and diabetes. The instruments of this research are not adult men; they are microscopic human embryos in the \u201cblastocyst\u201d stage of development. The embryos are dissected for their stem cells\u2014cells that can potentially form any kind of tissue in the body. In the process, the embryos are killed.</span></p> <p><span>My point is not to equate stem-cell research with the Tuskegee experiments. But judging by our universal revulsion at the Tuskegee story, it\u2019s clear that Americans have reached a bioethical consensus that firmly rejects the notion of sacrificing some human beings for the sake of (possibly) curing others\u2019 physical ailments.</span></p> <p><span>Of course, many supporters of stem-cell research do not consider human embryos to be actual living beings. Rather, they situate embryos at the beginning of a human life continuum that stretches all the way from non-life to viability. In this view, only much later in their development do embryos become creatures worthy of basic justice.</span></p> <p><span>Some therefore argue that frozen embryos merely have the \u201cpotential\u201d for life. This implies that they currently exist in a nebulous state of almost- or partial-aliveness. Logically speaking, can an embryo be partially alive? (Can a woman be partially pregnant?) If a frozen embryo is not worthy of legal protection until it is implanted in a womb, or until it is born, then we have made location the decisive criterion for personhood. But aside from their being at different stages of human development, what, really, is the difference between a frozen embryo awaiting implantation and, say, a nine-year-old girl who was conceived in a lab and once looked just like that frozen embryo? For that matter, weren\u2019t we all blastocysts at one point?</span></p> <p><span>A typical riposte from research enthusiasts is: \u201cWell, the human embryos in question are mostly \u2018leftover\u2019 embryos that were going to be discarded anyway, so...\u201d While this may be true, it obscures the underlying issue: namely, the moral status of those embryos. If embryos command the same legal claims as human beings, then we no more have the right to harvest their organs than we would those of death row prisoners or fetuses scheduled for abortion. (Plus, many people believe it is deplorable that \u201cleftover\u201d embryos are regularly destroyed at IVF clinics.)</span></p> <p><span>Naturally, microscopic blastocysts in a petri dish do not evoke our reflexive compassion the way those individuals suffering from awful, incurable diseases do. And indeed, if emotion were the sole determinant of one\u2019s position, he or she would undoubtedly favor stem-cell research. But public policy should not reflect a hasty utilitarian calculus born of sentimentality; it should reflect logic flowing from scrupulous moral deliberation. That may seem a callous thing to say, especially given the heartfelt appeals for stem-cell research from the likes of Michael J. Fox, who is afflicted with Parkinson\u2019s disease, and Christopher Reeve, who is paralyzed from the neck down. But our intrinsic human yearning to discover enhanced palliative treatments and unprecedented cures must not trump fundamental principles of justice.</span></p> <p><span>The public debate over stem cells is currently hindered by the absence of a common lexicon with which to delineate the profound ethical questions involved. For example: Are frozen embryos whole human beings, or are they somehow less than human? If the latter, when do embryos officially pass the threshold of \u201cpersonhood\u201d? Moreover, if blastocysts are not miniscule human lives, then what exactly are they?</span></p> <p><span>I urge all students interested in these challenging questions to attend Dr. Leon Kass\u2019s lecture on \u201cBrave New Biology: The Challenge for Human Dignity,\u201d tomorrow night in William James Hall at 8 p.m. Dr. Kass is the chair of President Bush\u2019s Council on Bioethics. He is also an articulate and compelling opponent of embryonic stem-cell research. You might not agree with his (or my) conclusions, and that\u2019s fine. But at the very least, I hope you\u2019ll come away with a more complete and nuanced understanding of the possible reservations one might have about Harvard\u2019s new research center.</span></p> <p><span><i>Duncan M.

{"title": "No Heart at Harvard | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Taking a comically unscientific survey of Harvard political attitudes last week\u2014searching for each respective political preference on thefacebook.com\u2014I obtained some very surprising results.  The liberal Harvard of Rush Limbaugh\u2019s dreams has gone the way of the Democratic wing of the Democratic party.</span></p> <p><span>At first, the numbers seemed to confirm the old myth: 13 percent of students identified themselves as \u201cVery Liberal,\u201d a full 47 percent said they were \u201cLiberal,\u201d 22 percent were \u201cModerate,\u201d 11 percent were \u201cConservative,\u201d 2 percent were \u201cVery Conservative\u201d and 6 percent were \u201cApathetic.\u201d Ostensibly, it appeared that outright liberals outnumbered outright conservatives on a four to one margin.  But the analysis does not end there.  Why? Unlike most surveys, this one is not anonymous.  Every \u201cVery Conservative\u201d student can be easily brought up onto my screen and carefully tabulated.</span></p> <p><span>Looking through the ranks of the stylish uber-liberal (I\u2019m a member!), the boring moderates, the frightening ultra-cons and the slacker apathetics, you begin to notice some people who really don\u2019t belong. There are people I know who are certainly conservative, who have droned on about the genius of Baker Professor of Economics Martin S. Feldstein \u201961 and the glories of free trade and the many successes of President Bush\u2019s War on Terror, labeling themselves as \u201cModerate\u201d and including the ubiquitous beer bottle in their profile picture to assure us that they are students in college.  Then there are political no-shows who can\u2019t name three vice-presidents and think Afghanistan is a punk-rock band selecting \u201cLiberal\u201d as a political preference and showing off those ideological credentials by including a quote by that liberal icon Winston Churchill.</span></p> <p><span>Going through these profiles, you begin to realize that people are playing politics with their political preferences. Let\u2019s start with the \u201cVery Liberal\u201d people. Choosing extremities is always socially risky, so most of these people are genuinely very liberal. The ones who aren\u2019t are liberal people whose liberal qualifications have been scorned or criticized in the past. For example, they may have supported Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, D-Conn., for president, or thought the war on Iraq was a good idea. To make up for their liberal insecurities they take the leap and contend that they are among the vanguard of the liberal elite. It\u2019s a safe bet to say that at least half of those calling themselves \u201cVery Liberal\u201d are instead just plain \u201cLiberal.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In the \u201cLiberal\u201d camp, where nearly half of Harvard claims inclusion, are many genuine liberals of the College Democrats variety, with their John Kerry bumper stickers, their aging \u201cLiving Wage Now!\u201d buttons, and their carefully cultivated subscriptions to the New Yorker.  But most of the others are liberal pretenders; moderates by trade, they reside in political limbo, non-committal to either the paradise above them or the hell below them. But since it\u2019s indisputably \u201ccooler\u201d to be a liberal in college, so many confused moderate souls fly up to liberal heaven. In other words, a lot of so-called liberals are really just socially ambitious moderates.</span></p> <p><span>Most \u201cModerates,\u201d meanwhile, are simply conservatives who are afraid to label themselves as such and scare off their liberal friends, who themselves of course are not that liberal. I offer one tangible example from thefacebook.com.  In the interests of privacy and fairness, let us call her Margaret Thatcher. Ms. Thatcher, a member of the Harvard Republican Club, claims in her profile to be a \u201cModerate,\u201d but has in the past told this very liberal writer that government should get off people\u2019s backs, but should also ban gay marriages. Logically unsound, effectively intolerant and intentionally insensitive, Ms. Thatcher\u2019s argument was classically conservative.  Her social life will surely suffer, but Ms. Thatcher and her fellow conservatives donning the shameful cloak of the moderate must end the charade now and reveal themselves in all their American-flag-draped glory.</span></p> <p><span>Say what you will about the explicitly \u201cConservative\u201d and \u201cVery Conservative\u201d among us, but at least they are honest.  Fair, balanced and unafraid, these brave souls who actually label themselves as Rightists in this liberal citadel are likely self-proclaimed \u201cHipublicans\u201d who allegedly use their acerbic and edgy wit to poke fun whenever liberalism runs amok. Granted, there are some posers in this camp as well, but most of them are of the ironic liberal variety that thinks it\u2019s funny to label themselves very conservative when in fact they are the opposite. The rest are flag-waving, Bible-thumping, altar-at-a-gay-wedding-smashing conservatives.</span></p> <p><span>So in the end, we arrive at the unsettling reality that we, at ages 18-22, are not as liberal as we should be. And that is not according to my very liberal judgment, but according to Winston Churchill, who once famously declared, \u201cIf you are not a liberal at 20, you have no heart. If you are not conservative at 40, you have no brain.\u201d Heartless at 20, I can only hope that we are all brainless at 40.</span></p> <p><span><i>Erol N.

{"title": "Stemming America's Potential | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>On the ninth hour of the ninth day of the eighth month of 2001, the clock struck midnight on stem- cell research. After 9 p.m. on Aug. 9, 2001, therapeutic cloning\u2014the production of new stem cell lines from early embryos\u2014was officially denied federal funding. Since that time, researchers studying everything from tissue regrowth to cell differentiation have faced an unpleasant choice: use expensive, often poor-quality federal stem-cell lines, if they are available at all, or seek substantial amounts of private money to generate new ones.</span></p> <p><span>Since the federal government has shirked support for what could be the most significant field of biological research for years to come, we are glad to see Harvard and other private institutions stepping in to help fill the funding void left by the Bush administration. Indeed, a recent press release confirmed that the University, which has already started to make stem-cell lines available to researchers across the country, is planning to open a stem-cell research hub at the new campus in Allston. University President Lawrence H. Summers is positioning Harvard at the forefront of the most exciting development in biological research\u2014which is great for the University community and, ultimately, humanity.</span></p> <p><span>But, although the future looks good for stem-cell research at Harvard, other universities across the country are finding it harder to keep up. Harvard and its partners have the financial wherewithal to pursue stem-cell research aggressively without federal funding\u2014not the case for most research institutions. Even now that the University has offered to give away the new stem-cell lines it creates, the absence of government money is severely retarding the progress of stem-cell research in the United States.</span></p> <p><span>This is a particularly frustrating problem because stem-cell research is just beginning to demonstrate its potential. Federally funded labs have been able to research up to a point\u2014they get government money as long as they use the few stem-cell lines the federal government has on hand. Yet once research goes beyond its initial stages and more fresh stem-call lines are required, government funds dry up. Research using stem cells to treat Parkison\u2019s disease, for instance, will require new stem-cell lines once clinical trials begin, says Ron McKay, a researcher at the federally-funded National Institutes of Health. To get those new stem-cell lines, scientists like McKay must compete for a limited pool of private funding, making it entirely possible that further research could go underfunded or totally unfunded.</span></p> <p><span>So why did President Bush impose such harmful restrictions? Quite simply, he associated the harvesting of lab-created embryos with abortion\u2014a dubious stretch, in our view. We find it hard to believe that a dozen undifferentiated cells created in a petri dish\u2014cells that will never develop into a human being\u2014should be protected with such zeal. Especially when they hold promising potential to repair damaged blood vessels or cure Alzheimer\u2019s disease.</span></p> <p><span>The rest of the world has embraced stem-cell research, and real progress is beginning to be made in countries like South Korea toward a host of exciting new cures. President Bush and his cohorts on the Christian Right can continue to hold the United States back, or they can finally get over their hang-ups and let American scientists join their colleagues abroad in bettering the human condition.</span></p>"}

In just a few 9/11-filled seconds, the president manages to break his promise not to politicize the attacks, offend those who gave their lives two and a half years ago and pretend to be the country\u2019s leading patriot. Though it would be difficult to come up with an appropriate way to turn footage of the World Trade Center\u2019s wreckage into a political promotion, the Bush ads don\u2019t even attempt to put up a fa\u00e7ade of respect for the attack victims.</span></p> <p><span>The thirty-second spot dubbed \u201cSafer, Stronger\u201d shows off the greatest number of images from Sept. 11. Behind text reading, \u201cThen...a day of tragedy\u201d and a sound of sirens in the background, the ad shows an American flag flying in front of the World Trade Center rubble. The image fades into two shots. On the left, a man hoists an American flag, while on the right four firefighters carry a body, draped in another flag. Just before the new slogan, \u201cA test for all Americans,\u201d disappears, the flag on the left fades into a video of Bush delivering a speech.</span></p> <p><span>Certainly, this is going to have a powerful effect on those independent viewers Bush is trying to scare into reelecting him. But Bush\u2019s dirty trick\u2014exploiting Sept. 11 in an attempt to recapture the community impulse that led Americans to rally behind the president after 9/11\u2014isn\u2019t going over as well as he had hoped.

Even though this is demonstrably false, as there is little to nothing about Bush\u2019s actual post-9/11 record in them, we hope that voters will take the time to consider Bush\u2019s performance instead of just letting the images scare them into voting red.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Who Will Stand With Haiti? | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>In 1802, during a brief respite in the Haitian War of Independence, French officers sought a meeting with recently retired Haitian General Toussaint L\u2019Overture. Under false pretenses, Toussaint was arrested and forced aboard a waiting frigate bound for France. He died of neglect in the Fort de Joux dungeon nine months later. This was the first forced regime change in Haitian history.</span></p> <p><span>The U.S. repeated history a little after the 200th anniversary of Haitian Independence. However, instead of a top military commander, democratically-elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide has been the one deposed by foreign forces\u2014flown out on an airplane leased by the U.S. State Department. Instead of solitary confinement in the Jura mountains, Aristide is currently trapped in a gilded cage in the Central African Republic, with little freedom of speech or movement. Although the circumstances are different, the parallels are striking.</span></p> <p><span>In a recent interview on National Public Radio, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell maintained \u201cWe did everything we could to find a political solution to this terrible crisis in Haiti.\u201d Yet, the veracity of this statement has been challenged by numerous reports of what took place in the weeks leading up to Aristide\u2019s recent removal from office. It seems the State Department refused to press the opposition to compromise and intead played \u201cgood cop, bad cop\u201d with the advancing \u201crebels\u201d to force out an elected president under threat of death and civil war.</span></p> <p><span>However, these recent events must be understood in a broader historical context. Since Aristide was first elected president in 1990 at the forefront of a grassroots democratic movement, his rule and Haitian sovereignty have been consistently challenged. A democracy where the poorest people in the Western Hemisphere would have power struck fear in the hearts of Washington officials and the Haitian elite. President Aristide held office for only seven months before he was ousted in a military coup.</span></p> <p><span>As Aristide endured three years of exile, the grassroots supporters of this democratic movement suffered the greatest hardship. With tacit support from the first Bush administration, training from U.S. Special Forces and CIA financing, the military dictatorship and its paramilitary forces murdered thousands whose only crime was supporting democracy. Little over a decade later, the U.S. has allowed these same paramilitary forces to come to power. Their only demand: to reinstate the military that Aristide abolished.</span></p> <p><span>Many assume that the current situation in Haiti is the inevitable result of President Clinton \u201cabandoning\u201d the country shortly after Aristide was reinstalled with the help of 20,000 U.S. Marines. But in truth, the Haitian people were never left alone. While supporting Haiti\u2019s political system, the Clinton administration undermined its economic sovereignty by compelling Aristide to adopt a harsh neo-liberal economic program prior to his return. This program included lowering tariffs on grain and meat imports, so that highly subsidized American exports could be dumped on the Haitian market, undercutting rural agriculture and new industries.</span></p> <p><span>This subversion of Haitian economic sovereignty has intensified under the second Bush administration. Despite a willingness to compromise on the outcome of eight disputed senatorial seats, more than $500 million in international loans and aid were blocked\u2014including a $146 million loan package from the Inter-American Development Bank earmarked for healthcare, education, transportation and potable water. Meanwhile, the Haitian government was pressured to shell out $5 million in interest on these loans and pay $66 million in arrears. Dependent on foreign aid, the Haitian government had to empty out half its foreign reserves, causing the Haitian gourde to lose 69 percent of its value.</span></p> <p><span>The U.S. government has also worked to politically undermine the democratic government. Most notably, over $3 million have gone to fund the opposition party \u201cDemocratic Convergence\u201d through the International Republican Institute. Since the 2000 parliamentary elections, the opposition has refused to participate in the electoral process. American support of the primarily upper-class opposition has succeeded in removing Aristide, even though this coalition of political parties and civil society groups has never received more than 12 percent of the popular vote.</span></p> <p><span>Lastly, over the past three years the Bush administration has done little to challenge the insurgence by former Haitian military groups from the Dominican Republic. Beginning in mid-2001, these cross-border raids have murdered dozens of police officers, government officials and civilians. The invasion of these \u201crebel\u201d groups in early February was just the culmination of a long campaign of terror and, like the first coup, they are targeting Aristide\u2019s supporters in all the areas where no Marines are found. With Aristide in exile, the U.S. is allowing history to be repeated, once again.</span></p> <p><span>In the last moments before his kidnappers forced him to leave, Toussaint L\u2019Overture said, \u201cIn overthrowing me, you have cut down in San Domingo only the trunk of the tree of liberty. It will spring up again by the roots for they are numerous and deep.\u201d In his first public address from the Central African Republic, Aristide drew upon these words to urge his supporters to non-violently resist this U.S.-led regime change.

The Bush administration\u2019s 2001 decision to restrict federal funding for projects working with a small batch of preexisting stem cells elicited cheers from those who feel that destroying embryos for the sake of research is tantamount to murder.</span></p> <p><span>But much of Harvard\u2019s medical community say the restrictions impeded the advancement of science across the nation.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHarvard scientists are a competitive lot,\u201d says Dr. George Q. Daley, a stem cell specialist at Harvard Medical School (HMS). \u201cHarvard is committed to moving science forward. We should be a leader in what could be one of the most revolutionizing fields of medicine.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The practice of therapeutic cloning begins with \u2018blank\u2019 stem cells that are genetically identical to those of the patient.</span></p> <p><span>Although minuscule in size, an embryonic stem cell\u2019s ability to develop into any other kind of cell in the body is important for the future of medicine.</span></p> <p><span>By prodding stem cells to become specialized cells and then implanting them into the patient to replace faulty tissue, doctors could cure debilitating conditions such as diabetes and Parkinson\u2019s disease.</span></p> <p><span>Daley says that Harvard scientists continue to do work with three of the dozen president-approved stem cell lines currently available for distribution.</span></p> <p><span>However, given that even these stem cell lines are expensive to obtain, support from outside organizations is crucial for ambitious projects.</span></p> <p><span>Some Harvard researchers have been able to use privately-funded work to circumvent Bush\u2019s restrictions.</span></p> <p><span>Dr. Douglas A. Melton, a molecular biologist at HMS, made headlines in 2003 when he announced that he had developed 17 embryonic stem cell lines, which he will make available for research this year.</span></p> <p><span>But since Melton\u2019s batch doesn\u2019t meet the criteria for federal approval, any scientist wanting to use these stem cell lines will need private funding, which is hard to come by.</span></p> <p><span>Even with financial support, experts agree that the ethics of cloning continue to make new projects controversial. Some critics deplore the destruction of embryos for the sake of research, which they equate to abortion.</span></p> <p><span>But Louis M. Guenin, who teaches ethics in science at HMS, contends that experiments with discarded embryos from fertility clinics can lead to important medical treatments.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt seems difficult to deny that relieving widespread suffering is morally better than destroying embryos at no gain,\u201d Guenin says.</span></p> <p><span>Like discarded embryos from fertility clinics, cloned embryos for research are not meant for implantation in the uterus, says Guenin, addressing concerns that the practice will lead to reproductive cloning.</span></p> <p><span>\u201c[Therapeutic cloning] is an avenue for the humanitarian relief of suffering,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>But despite the benefits, some are still weary.</span></p> <p><span>Dr. Walter Robinson, associate director of the Division of Medical Ethics at Harvard, says that the current regulation could push stem cell research to become commercialized. He says the major emphasis would become \u201cthe financial game instead of the open and free exchange of ideas.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cUltimately,\u201d Robinson adds, \u201cit becomes a competition on who gets to make the announcement first.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Despite the continued debate over research, and South Korea\u2019s significant breakthrough, Harvard scientists say they are excited by the progress in the field.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI was very pumped,\u201d Daley says, recalling his reaction to the news.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s really a small technical breakthrough, one that we\u2019ve done with mammals, but to finally do it with human embryonic stem cells...it\u2019s remarkable.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Jackeline Montalvo can be reached at montalvo@fas.harvard.edu.</span></p>"}

{"title": "The Shock That Wasn't | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>\u201cNo one can now doubt the word of America.\u201d It sounds like the punch line of a macabre joke after the WMD-related developments of the last few weeks, but Bush made this triumphal assertion in his State of the Union address a month ago. Five days after the speech, David Kay concluded that the weapons of mass destruction (WMD) Bush appointed him to find apparently did not exist. Twelve days after that, in a speech at Georgetown, CIA chief George Tenet averred that his agency had never told the president that Hussein posed an \u201cimminent threat\u201d to the world. The president\u2019s approval rating plunged in the week after Kay\u2019s \u201cwe were almost all wrong\u201d pronouncement\u2014briefly dropping below fifty percent for the first time\u2014and the White House is still scrambling to put out the political fire. And after all, isn\u2019t it just schockin? It turns out the administration distorted evidence\u2014nay!\u2014turned a blind eye to the lack of evidence supporting its claims! I, for one, have not been so utterly taken by surprise since Britney Spears announced that she wasn\u2019t really a virgin. No, the pundits can say what they want about Bush\u2019s shattered \u201ccredibility\u201d, but like the emperor and his clothes, the president never really had any to begin with. Credibility, that is.</span></p> <p><span>Long before David Kay took over in Iraq, before President Bush even gave the order to invade, teams of international weapons inspectors, led by Hans Blix and Mohammed El Baradei, spent months scouring Iraq for signs of chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, or programs for producing them, and turned up nothing. In an interview a few months after the war, Blix commented pointedly, \u2018\u2019What surprises me, what amazes me, is that it seems the military people were expecting to stumble on large quantities of gas, chemical weapons and biological weapons. I don\u2019t see how they could have come to such an attitude if they had, at any time, studied the [inspectors\u2019] reports.\u201d The president is trying to pass off this discrepancy between reality and his prewar claims as a failure of the intelligence community. (The commission he recently appointed has been charged to investigate this so-called intelligence failure.) In doing so, he has deflected attention from the real question: Why did his administration continue to claim that Saddam possessed WMD after inspectors on the ground came up empty-handed?</span></p> <p><span>It would indeed be reprehensible if\u2014as Tenet\u2019s testimony suggests\u2014the White House deliberately exaggerated the caveat-laden reports it received from intelligence agencies before the war. But one thing is certain: when the president decided to invade Iraq in March, declaring, \u201cthe Iraqi regime will be disarmed by force\u201d because it had \u201cnot disarmed itself,\u201d intensive inspections had yielded no evidence that the regime actually had any WMD of which to disarm itself. Nor were the Iraqis resisting the inspectors: on March 8, two weeks before the war began, Blix reported to the Security Council that the Iraqi regime had \u201cstarted the process of destruction,\u201d of its conventional Al Samoud missiles. Blix also noted the \u201csignificant Iraqi effort underway to clarify a major source of uncertainty as to the quantities of biological and chemical weapons which were unilaterally destroyed in 1991,\u201d and reported that inspectors \u201cfaced relatively few difficulties\u201d in accessing potential weapons-production sites. The problem, from the hawks\u2019 perspective, was that all this disarmament was getting in the way of regime change. Clearly such cooperation could not be allowed to stand!</span></p> <p><span>This is the real credibility issue: the administration\u2019s unwarranted abandonment of inspections flew in the face of its previous assurances that war was not a foregone conclusion.  In his Feb. 8 interview with Tim Russert, President Bush justified his decision, explaining that, had he not invaded Iraq, the world would \u201clook at us and say, they don\u2019t mean what they say, they are not willing to follow through.\u201d It\u2019s funny he should mention that. That is essentially what the world community has been saying since he prematurely ended the inspections\u2014without regard to the impressive progress made by Blix and El Baradei or the cooperation of the Iraqis\u2014after promising that the U.S. would only resort to war if inspections failed.</span></p> <p><span>Going back on our word like this can only weaken America\u2019s ability to make credible promises in the future. That prospect may not trouble the president, but empty promises are as dangerous as empty threats. Either way, our enemies know that it makes little difference to our military decisions whether they choose to be cooperative or belligerent. So why cooperate? To end up like Saddam \u201cI Opened My Country to Inspectors and All I Got Was This Lousy Spider Hole\u201d Hussein? No thanks!</span></p> <p><span>I\u2019m sure the president was disappointed to announce that the commission\u2019s report\u2014and any embarrassing revelations it may contain\u2014will not be released until March 2005, after the elections. But we already know that Bush launched a war that he had failed to justify\u2014that was never a secret to begin with. You have to hand it to him: Bush\u2019s most egregiously dishonest actions are the ones he is most upfront about.</span></p> <p><span><i>Eoghan W.

{"title": "Polluters Should Pay | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>A little over an hour from Boston, across from an elementary school in the heart of Fairhaven, Mass., sits the Atlas Tack Company. More than 7,000 people live within a mile of Atlas. More than 15,000 live within three miles. And for more than twenty years, Atlas released cyanide, arsenic and other toxic solvents into an adjacent marsh. Then in 1990, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) officials finally put the site on their National Priorities List for cleanup under the Superfund program\u2014a landmark initiative from 1980 that used to force polluters to pay for the damage they did.</span></p> <p><span>But after fourteen years, Atlas has still not been cleaned up. Just last year, President Bush put it and nine other sites scheduled for long-overdue care on hold because of a $227 million shortfall in the Superfund budget.</span></p> <p><span>Yet the story of the Atlas site is not extraordinary. Indeed, there are over a thousand superfund sites languishing on EPA lists that continue to be a danger to communities across the country. And just this week, for the third year in a row, Bush added an unusually low number of new sites to the National Priorities List and encouraged Superfund budget cuts.</span></p> <p><span>To those who remember Superfund\u2019s glory days\u2014back in the \u201980s and \u201990s when it was flush with money\u2014the program\u2019s funding problems may seem unbelievable. It all stems from Congress\u2019s decision in 1995 to turn its back on the principle that polluters should pay to clean up the messes they make. Until 1995, Superfund got most of its money from polluters. In most cases, the company that contaminated a site would pay to clean it up. In cases where no existing company was responsible for a contaminated site\u2014so-called orphan sites\u2014Superfund relied on a trust fund which companies from polluting industries were compelled to pay into.</span></p> <p><span>In 1995, Congress failed to reauthorize the trust fund, shifting the burden from polluters to taxpayers. Since then, polluters have enjoyed a $4 million-a-day tax break at the expense of everyone else. In 1995, taxpayers covered just 18 percent of Superfund\u2019s costs. This year, they will pay for a larger portion of the program. And now that the president has plunged the country into fiscal crisis, right-wing opponents of Superfund have an excuse to cut the program\u2019s funding. Just when the Bush administration claimed it could not afford to add sites to the National Priorities list, it worked with its allies in Congress to cut Superfund funding by $8 million. Superfund spending is down more than 24 percent from average spending under President Clinton. Bush claims cuts to programs like Superfund are necessary to balance the budget, but if the Republicans had not gotten polluters off the hook, Superfund would not aggravate the budget at all.</span></p> <p><span>As funding cuts take their toll, more and more sites are getting ignored. In the mid to late \u201990s, Superfund cleaned up an average of 87 sites per year. In 2003, the program cleaned less than half that number. If Superfund continues to be the victim of tight budgets and misplaced priorities, even more sites will end up like Atlas.</span></p> <p><span>The folks who live next to the Atlas site, like those who live near more than 1,200 active Superfund sites nationwide, are the victims of a president and a Congress that puts polluters before people. Though we doubt President Bush and his kangaroo Congress will have a change of heart, reauthorizing the trust fund would be the right thing to do. And, in the meantime, Congress ought not cut Superfund\u2019s budget anymore. The people of Fairhaven deserve better than that.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Possible Sunshine in a Plotless Year | Arts | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Anyhow, with the 2003 film year officially over, we look ahead to a new annum of quality cinema. So far, I\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised, with anticipated stinkers like <i>Miracle</i> and <i>The Dreamers</i> turning out fully palatable. Golden Globe winner <i>Osama</i>, was a bit muted in tone, but nevertheless a sharp portrait of Taliban-era Afghanistan. The biggest revelation of all, though, was my unexpected admiration for <i>The Passion of the Christ</i>, which exceeded my admittedly low expectations to emerge as one of the more meaningful films I\u2019ve seen in quite some time.</span></p> <p><span>This coming spring looks to be unusually entertaining due to the long-awaited blossoming of a crop of big-name indies. The March 19th release <i>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</i> is tops on my list; I\u2019ve watched that trailer a dozen times over and it still discombobulates me whenever I see Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet bathing in a kitchen sink (why is that sink so big?) or Mark Ruffalo and Kirsten Dunst dancing in their underwear (why is Kirsten Dunst not more often dancing in her underwear?). Throw in Charlie Kaufman, the most reliable screenwriter functioning in Hollywood today, and the inspired use of ELO\u2019s \u201cMr. Blue Sky,\u201d and already saliva stains are appearing down my shirt.</span></p> <p><span>To put that horrible image behind us, I\u2019ll move on to another pedigreed work of lofty repute, <i>Dogville</i>, which is coming to Boston sometime early in April. The high-wattage attention Nicole Kidman brings to this project will make it bound for the kind of mainstream controversy Lars von Trier\u2019s past work has generally avoided with low-key casting. But as the movie features no intercalary song-and-dance numbers to revivify his <i>Dogme</i> formula, I\u2019m not expecting anything vastly different from his previous similarly themed films\u2014which I don\u2019t suppose is such a bad thing.</span></p> <p><span>Tom Hanks needs to win an Oscar for <i>The Ladykillers</i>. The Sexy Beast-meets-Duplex premise seems pretty flimsy, but when Hanks starts guffawing like some maniacal demon clown and demanding \u201cwaffles forthwith,\u201d I begin giggling uncontrollably.</span></p> <p><span>I also want to direct your and our four readers\u2019 attentions to some of the less heralded fare that might only show up at Coolidge Corner or Brattle. Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter\u2026and Spring tells the story of a single Buddhist monk and the five stages of his life that he experiences upon a floating monastery in the middle of a lake. The seemingly innocuous conceit hides some darker material, which apparently entangles him in some violent child games and ardent love affairs. The visuals, provided by South Korean director Kim Ki-Duk, are supposed to be amazing and the press stills alone are masterfully framed compositions.</span></p> <p><span>Jim Jarmusch (<i>Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai</i>) is also releasing a visual stunner, the black-and-white <i>Coffee and Cigarettes</i>. The movie\u2019s basically a collection of shorts he\u2019s made over the past decade and a half, where a bunch of random famous people sit around and chat. These people include the White Stripes, Roberto Benigni, Iggy Pop, Cate Blanchett, Steve Buscemi and, in a single conversation, RZA, GZA and Bill Murray. Will probably appeal to Waking Life fans or anyone whose wondering what the hell Wu Tang has to say to Carl Spackler.</span></p> <p><span>But of course, the bulk of my movie cash is saved up for all the popcorn I\u2019m buying when Hollywood pulls out the big guns. Based on the really killer trailer, I\u2019ve got some high hopes for zombie-filled remake <i>Dawn of the Dead</i>, which will hopefully maintain the satirist attitude of the original while avoiding the general tedium of last year\u2019s <i>28 Days Later</i>. <i>Kill Bill: Volume Two</i> is supposed to be more Tarantino than the first one, though at this point, I\u2019d be pretty content just to see Bill killed. There\u2019s also some small part of me, a stray Y chromosome, perhaps, yearning against its best judgment to see Troy. I mean, for Christ\u2019s sakes man, look how many CGI ships they\u2019ve fit into that CGI sea.</span></p> <p><span>Oh and apparently, there\u2019s another Benji movie coming out. Remember Benji? He saved lives a lot, even though he was a dog, which is a generally stupid animal.</span></p> <p><span>And that\u2019s just in the spring. Before I finish off with my breakdown of the explosive duds of the summer and hopeful Oscar contenders of the winter (a list which, last year, would have included sure things <i>The Human Stain</i>, <i>The Alamo</i> and <i>The Missing</i>), I\u2019m curious as to your take on the past two months of film, and what you\u2019re looking forward to most in the months ahead.</span></p> <p><span><b>BEN SOSKIN</b>: Thanks for your gracious congrats on my Oscar predictions, which even I wasn\u2019t expecting would be so accurate (do I get extra points for guessing the breath spray?). Honestly, though, I wish that I had missed in more of the categories\u2014it wasn\u2019t worth sitting through four hours of foregone conclusions just to get gloating privileges.</span></p> <p><span>Well, I\u2019m glad one of us is excited about the coming year of films. A couple of months ago, I dug into upcomingmovies.com\u2019s long, long list of 2004 releases and hardly found any movies that I was much looking forward to; thank goodness I\u2019ve made the jump from film junkiedom to political junkiedom.</span></p> <p><span>This year, the only movie that I\u2019m guaranteed to line up for on opening weekend is July\u2019s <i>Anchorman</i>, in which Will Ferrell brings his Goulet voice (and its accompanying egomania) to the big screen. \u00a0People who have seen the script have said that <i>Anchorman</i> could be a modern classic, and so far they\u2019ve been proven right by the clip reel on the movie\u2019s website (Ferrell to his dog: \u201cYou pooped in the refrigerator? . . . . I\u2019m not even mad! \u00a0That\u2019s amazing!\u201d). In the fall, Steven Soderbergh\u2019s <i>Ocean\u2019s Twelve</i> should be a romp, and I\u2019ll probably check out Martin Scorsese\u2019s star-laden Howard Hughes biopic <i>The Aviator</i>, Oliver Stone\u2019s <i>Alexander</i>, and Terry Gilliam\u2019s <i>The Brothers Grimm</i>.</span></p> <p><span>But as for the spring, I\u2019ll be there with you for the second <i>Kill Bill</i>, even though Quentin\u2019s coasting. \u00a0And I\u2019ll be there too for <i>The Ladykillers</i>, even though the Coens have been batting around .333 since Barton Fink; I\u2019m sick of paying $10 just to hear George Clooney use \u201chydroelectric\u201d as a verb, or to hear Jon Polito emphasize the wrong syllable in \u201cdry cleaning.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Thanks for giving a shout-out to <i>Coffee and Cigarettes</i>, which should be a fun time; I saw the Tom Waits/Iggy Pop short in a VES section once and loved its casual humor, so I\u2019d bet that the feature will be a good time, too.</span></p> <p><span>I haven\u2019t seen much the past couple months, and what I have seen has been Oscar catch-up. \u00a0Last Monday, I went down to Kendall and saw <i>Monster</i> and <i>The Fog of War</i> back-to-back. \u00a0I thought that <i>Fog of War</i> was a cutting stunner, right up there with <i>The Thin Blue Line</i> as the best Errol Morris I\u2019ve seen. \u00a0I mostly saw <i>Monster</i> because it was shot in my hometown\u2014my sister thinks that the film\u2019s skating rink is the same one where we spent a lot of Saturday mornings back in elementary school\u2014so I appreciated the film more for that than for its piss poor plotting or Charlize\u2019s courageous stunt performance.</span></p> <p><span>I won\u2019t see <i>The Dreamers</i> because I\u2019m not big on Bertolucci, and I won\u2019t see <i>Eternal Sunshine</i> because I\u2019m not big on Charlie Kaufman (\u201cI can see your sadness\u201d ranks as 2002\u2019s dumbest line not written by George Lucas). I\u2019ll probably also skip <i>Dogville</i>, because I\u2019m not inclined to check out another Von Trier, even if he\u2019s spinning Our Town. \u00a0If I have to watch a Dogme man reinterpret Thornton Wilder, I\u2019ll wait for Thomas Vinterberg to take a deranged stab at The Matchmaker.</span></p> <p><span><b>BEN B. CHUNG</b>: First off, I\u2019m a bit dismayed that as a fellow admirer of cinema, you\u2019re not \u201cbig on Charlie Kaufman.\u201d The man\u2019s an unequivocal genius and the fact that his scripts have attracted the attention of such brand names as Nicolas Cage, Jim Carrey and Meryl Streep (in a supporting role, no less), makes his work all the more admirable. I defy you to name another working screenwriter who has invented a film premise as consistently innovative as <i>Being John Malkovich</i>, a screenplay as audacious as <i>Adaptation</i>, or a plot structure that is as simultaneously accessible and convoluted as <i>Confessions of a Dangerous Mind</i>.</span></p> <p><span>Also, in defense of the line, \u201cI can see your sadness\u201d (I apparently have more invested in this debate than even I expected), you seem to forget its context. It was delivered by an immigrant worker whose imperfect English was intended to make it sound somewhat stilted, excusing any loss of impact derived therein. I present to you another line from <i>Adaptation</i> that single-handedly trumps any off-day Kaufman offerings, when Donald Kaufman describes the screenplay he\u2019s working on: \u201cSo the killer flees on horseback with the girl, the cop\u2019s after them on a motorcycle and it\u2019s like a battle between motors and horses, like technology vs. horse.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But I seem to have derailed my train of thought quite a bit and will now dive into 2004\u2019s other promising offerings. The summer months will be slightly less clogged with redundant sequels than in years past, though general quality hardly seems a guarantee. I\u2019m expecting solid laughs from <i>Eulogy</i>, a dysfunctional family comedy starring Zooey Deschanel, an exceptionally talented ingenue who\u2019s been looking for a bigger vehicle after working wonders in minor classics <i>Almost Famous</i> and <i>All the Real Girls</i>.</span></p> <p><span>The third Harry Potter looks substantially better than its two predecessors, likely due to acting lessons for li\u2019l Radcliffe and the capable direction of Alfonso Cuaron, who could probably turn See Spot Run into a haunting examination of the human soul with vague sexual undertones. <i>Sky Captain</i> and the <i>World of Tomorrow</i> has been apparently sitting on the shelf for some time which immediately sends up warning signals, but the outlandish, late \u201930s detective comic visuals in the trailer suggest a full realization of the powers of CGI technology. A safer bet will be Richard Linklater\u2019s <i>Before Sunset</i>, a continuation of the <i>Before Sunrise</i> story nine years after Jesse and Celine first meet on that train to Vienna.</span></p> <p><span>I will try to keep the ink spilt on 2004\u2019s inexorable dreck to a minimum, but I must mention the worst-looking film of the year, <i>The Whole Ten Yards</i>, an inexplicable sequel to 2000\u2019s marginally successful Matthew Perry/Bruce Willis buddy vehicle. The film\u2019s preview features a mulleted, apron-donning Willis vacuuming in bunny slippers as he scolds Perry for touching his chickens. So many questions, so very little interest in the answers.</span></p> <p><span>As usual, the year\u2019s end is rich with prestige films that studios will cast out as juicy Oscar bait. One of my most cherished films, <i>The Manchurian Candidate</i>, is being remade with Denzel Washington and Meryl Streep on board. Though remakes of classic films are only occasionally successful, this pedigree will guarantee at least a vastly entertaining mess (I can hear those Gus Van Sant Psycho violins now).</span></p> <p><span>Michael Mann has yet to strike out and he has Tom Cruise and Mark Ruffalo for the cabbie-in-peril thriller <i>Collateral</i>. The reliable Johnny Depp also tries for a second consecutive Academy nod in <i>J.M. Barrie\u2019s Neverland</i>, as the titular author of Peter Pan. And finally, Michael Moore\u2019s Bush-bashing documentary <i>Fahrenheit 9-11</i> will sparkle as the <i>Winged Migration</i> of 2004. \u201cKerry/Moore 2004\u201d has a nice ring to it, don\u2019t you think?</span></p> <p><span><b>BEN SOSKIN</b>: On Kaufman\u2019s alleged greatness: the very same year that <i>Adaptation</i> came out, there was a wonderful Scandinavian film called <i>Songs from the Second Floor</i> that managed to be audacious, innovative, accessible and convoluted all at once. But the ease or difficulty of such a feat shouldn\u2019t be the issue here: Kaufman, along with \u201ccreative\u201d filmmakers like Wes Anderson and Darren Aronofsky, have proven that audacity and innovation don\u2019t automatically beget relatable characters, untiresome plotting, or, as I alluded to with the \u201csadness\u201d line, thematic grace; if Kaufman didn\u2019t want the line to be trite and heavy-handed, he should have found a different way to express the sentiment behind it.</span></p> <p><span>Not that there are a lot of people who can consistently write Grade-A dialogue for the above passel of purposes; one of the only ones who\u2019s currently working is Richard Linklater. Which is why I\u2019m overjoyed that you uncovered <i>Before Sunset</i>, whose predecessor was everything that <i>Lost in Translation</i> could\u2019ve been. I think Linklater\u2019s been hit-and-miss for a few years\u2014School of Rock aside, <i>Tape</i> underwhelmed me, and all that <i>Waking Life</i> had going for it was innovative presentation (there\u2019s that dubious \u201cI\u201d word again) and enough aimless, useless philosophizing to fill a semester of Moral Reasoning lectures\u2014but I am very pumped for the Ethan/Julie reunion.  It\u2019s the next best thing to the <i>Brief Encounter</i> sequel that we never got.</span></p> <p><span>Like you, I love <i>The Manchurian Candidate</i>, and, like you, I\u2019m apprehensive about the remake; I don\u2019t think that Jonathan Demme\u2019s flair can compensate for a script written by a guy whose past credits include <i>The Sum of All Fears</i> and <i>Doc Hollywood</i>. On the other hand, I don\u2019t think that remakes are necessarily bad, especially with the right cachet; I was fine with paying top dollar to see the <i>Psycho</i> remake, for example, because I couldn\u2019t pass up the chance to see William H. Macy and Julianne Moore slotted into a Hitchcock movie. I would also enjoy a shot-by-shot <i>North by Northwest</i> remake starring Jeff Bridges and Reese Witherspoon, or a do-over of <i>The Birds</i> starring people who could act.</span></p> <p><span>And not that you asked, but I actually didn\u2019t mind <i>The Whole Nine Yards</i>; I thought it had a lot of the same good scene-by-scene, line-by-line timing that its no-name director brought to <i>My Cousin Vinny</i>, and I may be one of the few people who thinks that Matthew Perry is the most talented Friend (I know, that\u2019s like declaring that there\u2019s a tastiest diet soda).</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff writer Ben B.

{"title": "Notes from Underground | Arts | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Simon W. Vozick-levinson", "body": "<p><span>On Feb. 29, director Sam Green sat in Hollywood\u2019s Kodak Theater for the 76th Academy Awards, where his 2003 film <i>The Weather Underground</i> was nominated for Best Documentary Feature. This Tuesday he was in New York, where the film was included in the Whitney Museum of American Art\u2019s biennial exhibition.</span></p> <p><span>But standing before an audience at the Harvard Film Archive (HFA) on Sunday, Green seems much less interested in these measures of institutional favor than he is with the reactions he\u2019s getting from the students who have just seen his first feature film. On Monday, he stopped by Visual and Environmental Studies (VES) 51a, \u201cFundamentals of Video,\u201d to show his film and speak with a handful of film students about the Sundance-premiered film on militant radicals in the 1960s and 1970s.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s great to be in theaters and it\u2019s great to be on PBS, but the audience that I feel most strongly I\u2019d like to see it is young people,\u201d Green says on a cell phone call from his Boston-New York train. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any interest in making a piece that was going to be a walk down memory lane for baby boomers.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>This is perhaps not the most natural strategy for a film that painstakingly documents the mindset that drove formerly-peaceful activists to adopt a philosophy of violence as the Vietnam War spiraled out of control. The students who made up the Weathermen, later the Weather Underground, chose to express their objections to what they saw as an unjust, needlessly-murderous war with a series of domestic bombings throughout the 1970s on targets including the U.S. Capitol and Harvard\u2019s Center for International Affairs.</span></p> <p><span>Though their bombs never killed anyone but three of their own members in an accidental explosion, the members of the Weather Underground had inverted the very principles of pacifism that had motivated so many to oppose the Vietnam War in the first place. Green\u2019s film is a 90-minute attempt to understand that contradiction\u2014but ultimately, he says, the questions surrounding the Weather Underground cannot be answered for those who lived through the events.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s their story in a way,\u201d he says, but when he shows his film to boomers, he says, \u201cthe discussion afterwards digresses into who was right then.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Instead, the 37-year-old Green says he wants to make a new generation aware of this profound moral dilemma and its renewed relevance. While some directors were doing publicity junkets with the national press or mounting aggressive Oscar campaigns, Green and co-director Bill Siegel embarked on an irregular tour of college campuses this fall. They continue to take time every few weeks to travel across the country, screening their film for students and interacting with them afterward. The day of his Harvard screening, Green conducted another showing at Brandeis University, and in the days before that he had stopped by Hampshire College and Williams College, starting dialogues with the students who saw his film.</span></p> <p><span>This kind of direct contact hasn\u2019t come without a price, according to Elisabeth Subrin, the VES visiting lecturer and filmmaker whom Green credits with helping bring him to Cambridge this weekend.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cSam could have handed this film to a much more mainstream distributor and had no relationship with the audience,\u201d Subrin says. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of fun, but it\u2019s back-breaking work when you go to college campuses. It\u2019s certainly not a financial move.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Green\u2019s only complaint about his visit to Harvard, though, is that there were too many middle-aged people and not enough students in the audience at the archive. The decades-old wounds explored by <i>The Weather Underground</i> are still far from healing\u2014a fact made clear by the scattered hisses that greeted figures from Richard Nixon to Todd Gitlin, a more moderate figure from the anti-war movement of the 1960s, as they appeared on screen at the HFA.</span></p> <p><span>Green says the film has met with a wide variety of responses\u2014but never a lack of emotion\u2014at the screenings he has attended.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cOccasionally someone will stand up and say, \u2018Why are you supporting terrorism?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cAt the same time, there are people on the left who feel that it\u2019s too critical. I think that if you\u2019re getting an equal amount of flak from both sides, you\u2019ve found a good center.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><b>Storm on the Horizon</b></span></p> <p><span>Green\u2014from the middle generation, born between the boomers he knows are still racked by the debates of the 1960s and the youth he now hopes to bring into them\u2014says his interest in the Weather Underground long predates his career as a filmmaker.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI remember reading something about the group when I was a teenager,\u201d Green says. \u201cIt was very romantic in a way.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>And the fundamental, unanswered question of the film\u2014whether a radical ideology can be made to fit the confines of mainstream society\u2014is one that Green says he often wondered about.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI grew up in the eighties and had idealistic impulses, but I looked around and it was a pretty bleak time,\u201d he says. \u201cI always wondered how the sixties became the eighties.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The decade of Green\u2019s youth, kicked off by the surrender of the Weather Underground\u2019s remaining leaders to authorities in 1980, is represented in the film by starkly ironic images: clips from an aerobics video and footage of Ronald Reagan are juxtaposed with the rise of AIDS and crack cocaine.</span></p> <p><span>Green says <i>The Weather Underground</i> began in earnest in 1998 out of \u201ccuriosity\u201d springing from a series of conversations with a former activist living near him in San Francisco.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI thought, \u2018God, somebody should make a movie out of this,\u2019\u201d Green recalls.But as a director who had made only two previously-released films, the longest running 45 minutes, Green said he did not think himself up to the task at first.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI tried to get a friend of mine who\u2019s an established director, Mary Harron, to do it and I would help her,\u201d Green says. \u201cI really hadn\u2019t done anything this ambitious.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In 2000, Green says, he decided to go it alone, but he says the film faced financial challenges from the start.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cGetting grants to do a documentary about a group that tried to violently overthrow the U.S. government is not an easy thing,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>And Green says the strong feelings still held by many on the film\u2019s subject made it difficult to research\u2014a process that meant not only hours combing through network news archives but also extensive in-person interviews with prominent figures from the would-be revolution.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s obviously not the kind of story where you can go to the library, check out two books and know everything there is to know about it,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>In one striking clip from <i>The Weather Underground</i>, activists bar journalists\u2014\u201cvultures,\u201d in their words\u2014from a leftist convention. The main characters of Green\u2019s film spent ten years hiding from the world.  And in a time when even the Weather Underground\u2019s deathless bombings strike any number of deeply-felt chords, Green says he found that many of his subjects retained the same distrust of publicity.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cInitially everybody thought it was a bad idea,\u201d he says. \u201cEveryone we talked to said, \u2018Don\u2019t make this movie.\u2019 Almost all the accounts of what happened had been very negative.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Green says it was only after many months of off-record conversations that he and Siegel built up the trust of their subjects.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHis patience and diplomacy in dealing with these people was remarkable,\u201d Subrin says. \u201cIt was a kind of Herculean task.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Even after getting former Weathermen to speak with him on camera, Green says the interviews were far from easy.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThey were always a little bit tense,\u201d Green says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a relaxed, easy story. There was always a point in every interview where the person would draw a line and say, \u2018I don\u2019t want to talk about that.\u2019...All the interviews were a negotiation.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Green says the activists often refused to talk about the details of their militant campaigns and their participants.</span></p> <p><span>Once he had secured funding and coaxed the former Weathermen into opening up to the camera, Green still faced the challenge of putting their actions in context.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cObviously they were inspired by the horror of Vietnam,\u201d he says. \u201cIt took me a long time of doing research and talking to people before I actually appreciated how horrific the war was.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In the film, present-day interviews and old news broadcasts are juxtaposed with several punishing sequences depicting brutal violence in Vietnam. Green says he struggled to save these passages from leaving audiences numb.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s very hard these days, because we\u2019ve seen so much death and so much killing on TV...for that kind of imagery to have any power,\u201d Green says.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cSam handled it really carefully,\u201d Subrin says. \u201cIt would have been really easy for him to be gratuitous with the images he used.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In one particularly disturbing scene, the camera shows a Vietnamese man being shot in the head at point-blank range in a street. The moving image, familiar to many as a still photo, is rendered all the more powerful in slow motion.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhen I saw it for the first time it just assaulted me,\u201d Green says. \u201cIt was as if someone hit me in the face... That is what war is.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Robb Moss, the Arnheim lecturer on filmmaking and the teacher of VES 51a, where Green spoke, says he finds this sequence\u2019s retrieval of an iconic still image to be an apt metaphor for Green\u2019s technique in <i>The Weather Underground</i>.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s kind of an image of what Sam\u2019s movie does,\u201d Moss says. \u201cMy recollection of events was the photograph, but his movie gives me the before and after.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><b>Aftermath</b></span></p> <p><span>After finishing the lengthy process of culling archival footage and filming new interviews, Green faced a task in some ways even more daunting: editing the many hours he had collected into a coherent narrative.</span></p> <p><span>In the middle of editing, Green says, an event of huge international significance threatened to end his own documentary project. When terrorists attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in September 2001, he says, his uncompleted film\u2019s attempt to understand a group of people who had bombed public and private buildings to bring down the government acquired an unsettling resonance.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cBefore Sept. 11, it was kind of a forgotten piece of history,\u201d Green says. \u201cThe context changed so much.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>For a time, Green says he considered abandoning the project outright.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cInitially after Sept. 11 happened, I sort of felt like it wouldn\u2019t be possible to finish,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the couple weeks after it I thought, \u2018I\u2019ve done all this work and it\u2019s for naught.\u2019\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Though he says he tried not to let the aftermath of the terrorist attacks affect the film as he resumed editing, Green admits that he felt the need to change its tone subtly.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAfter Sept. 11, there was no room to be light about it,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>But ultimately Green says he felt that the events of September 2001 made it more important to bring out the issues raised by the Weather Underground\u2019s actions, no matter how uncomfortable that sometimes was.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAfter a few weeks, when it became clear what the response to Sept. 11 would be, and hearing [President] Bush flattening out these complex issues, I began to feel like it was more important and relevant than ever,\u201d Green says.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhy is an act of violence in one situation considered a country\u2019s duty and in another situation considered a terrorist act?\u201d Subrin asks. \u201cWhat could be more salient than that question today? Is there a more important question in 2004?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>This is not a question that <i>The Weather Underground</i> ultimately answers with any clarity, Subrin adds.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cA viewer leaves the film not knowing why [the events it narrates] happened,\u201d Subrin says.</span></p> <p><span>In such a context, though, Green says it was important not to force pat answers.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThose kind of things, I think, should be looked at in all their complexity,\u201d Green says. \u201cHopefully it might muddy those waters.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff writer Simon W.

{"title": "The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>For Cabot Professor of the Natural Sciences Douglas A. Melton, innovative medical research is about more than furthering the cause of science. It\u2019s personal.</span></p> <p><span>When Melton\u2019s two children were diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, it altered the course of his research\u2014ultimately, it would change Melton\u2019s life. Since the diagnoses, Melton has become one of Harvard\u2019s most public academics. In 1999, he testified before the Senate, making a personal plea for approval of stem-cell research. This November, he developed a semi-subversive program to push his research forward despite government embargos. And in March, Harvard announced Melton would be co-director of a multi-million dollar center for stem cell research based at the University.</span></p> <p><span>Since he learned of his childrens\u2019 affliction 14 years ago, Melton and his team have focused their work on using stem cells, tissue extracted from frozen human embryos, to develop a cure for diabetes. But prohibitions laid down by the Bush administration three years ago narrowed their research to a set of only 15 approved lines, which Melton has criticized as limited in quality and diversity.</span></p> <p><span>After years of struggling to innovate within the limited set, Melton decided to take matters into his own hands. Government provisions only apply if scientists use federal money to do their research. Working with money lent by private donors\u2014including Harvard University, the government of Singapore and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation\u2014Melton built his own supply of stem cells. In a two year process, he procured a set of 17 cell lines from a Boston in-vitro fertilization clinic, which extracted the tissue from discarded embryos whose donors gave written consent.</span></p> <p><span>The vanguard project has potentially enormous implications. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a very rare circumstance when you can ask the most fundamental and interesting questions in the lab and have them matter to the lay public. \u00a0It\u2019s a special opportunity,\u201d Dr. Jayaraj Rajagopal who works in Melton\u2019s lab, said in an email. As a scientific tool, the cell lines, which Melton has made available to the scientific community at no charge, can be valuable to researchers in a number of fields. As a political statement, Melton is defying the Bush administration\u2019s rules of bioethics.</span></p> <p><span>While the embryonic cells, unique in their biological simplicity, are particularly useful to scientists, they have raised a number of bioethical and religious concerns. Anyone who experiments with Melton\u2019s cells will have to do so without government funding\u2014and will have to combat fierce ethical contestation as well. \u201cIt\u2019s been extraordinary to watch the science progressing in the face of enormous political obstacles,\u201d Rajagopal wrote.</span></p> <p><span>But Melton remains unfazed. He maintains that his 17 lines are not enough. \u201cThe number [of stem cells] needed is far greater than that which is available,\u201d he says in a press release from the Molecular and Cellular Biology department. \u201cWe need stem cells that represent the full genetic diversity of the population. I\u2019ll be sorry if this is the end of our efforts. My hope is that this is just the beginning.\u201d</span></p>"}
{"title": "What Appeasement? | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Evidence now suggests that al Qaeda carried out last week\u2019s Madrid bombings in retaliation for Spain\u2019s involvement in the Iraqi invasion and ongoing occupation. Before the attacks, Prime Minister Azanar\u2019s Popular party enjoyed a comfortable lead in the polls. On Sunday they were ousted by incoming Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero and his Socialist party. Conservative pundits, like New York Times columnist David Brooks, have been quick to denounce the Spaniards for appeasing Al Qaeda.  Their arguments are not without merit, but they are overly crude and mistakenly conflate the fight against Islamic terrorism with the war against Iraq.</span></p> <p><span>First the merits: The Spanish electorate did indeed switch its support from the Popular Party to the Socialists in the wake of the bombing, precipitating a shift in Spain\u2019s Iraqi policy. Conservatives are right to point out that al Qaeda will likely view the Spanish elections as a major coup, a successful intervention into the domestic politics of a western democracy. This success could well invigorate and energize al Qaeda, and even encourage similar acts in the future.</span></p> <p><span>These are troubling facts and are cause for legitimate concern. But do they justify the charges of appeasement? I believe not.</span></p> <p><span>For starters, the Spanish public did not change its position on Iraq in the aftermath of the attacks; 90 percent of the electorate opposed Azanar\u2019s decision to send troops in the first place. The majority of swing voters\u2014those who switched their votes to the Socialists in the wake of bombings\u2014had planned to vote for Azanar\u2019s Popular Party in spite of its policy on Iraq.</span></p> <p><span>Furthermore, Zapatero\u2019s position on Iraq hardly marks a dramatic shift in Spanish policy, a point that has received surprisingly little attention in the press. Zapatero\u2019s pledge to remove Spain\u2019s 1,300 troops\u2014which constitute less than 1 percent of the total Iraqi occupation force\u2014by the end of June, failing a United Nations mandate, certainly didn\u2019t win him any friends in the Bush administration. But the UN is quite likely to issue a mandate, making the chances of a Spanish withdrawal slim.</span></p> <p><span>In fact, charges of Spanish appeasement are concerned less with policy shifts than with the rationale behind them. Conservative pundits are really out to make a point about national character\u2014namely that ours is stronger than Spain\u2019s, and the rest of Europe\u2019s too, for that matter. As Brooks wrote last Tuesday, \u201ctoday more than any other, it really does appear that Americans are from Mars, Europeans are from Venus.\u201d The gender coding here is no accident\u2014we manly Americans would never have folded like those effeminate Spaniards.</span></p> <p><span>Appeasement implies cowardly capitulation; it suggests a policy motivated chiefly by fear. But the conservative pundits have gotten it wrong. The Popular Party wasn\u2019t unseated by fear; it was defeated by anger\u2014an emotion we Martians should know something about.</span></p> <p><span>The difference is that Spaniards lashed out at their own government.  On the eve of the election, for example, furious protestors marched through the streets of Madrid, chanting \u201cOur Dead, Your War.\u201d But voters were most angered by Azanar\u2019s poor handling of the crisis. Distrust of the government had already begun to grow in recent months, as official claims that Iraq possessed WMD\u2019s proved unfounded. This distrust only deepened in the immediate aftermath of the bombings, after Azanar assigned blame to the Basque terrorist group ETA, an act many Spaniards believed to be deliberately deceptive.</span></p> <p><span>Voters were also alienated by the Popular Party\u2019s sharp condemnation of spontaneous anti-government protests on the eve of election. And resentment only deepened after the protests received minimal coverage on state-owned TVE,  Spain\u2019s main television station, which chose instead to air an anti-ETA documentary. By the time many Spanish voters reached the polls, they were moved more by anger toward their own government than by fear of additional al Qaeda reprisals.</span></p> <p><span>The appeasement charge also implies that Spaniards have chosen to elect a new government less tough on terror than the old. But when, on Monday, Zapatero declared that his \u201cmost immediate priority will be to fight terrorism,\u201d I saw no reason to doubt his sincerity. Unfortunately, conservatives suffer from a proclivity to conflate \u201ctoughness\u201d on Iraq with \u201ctoughness\u201d on terror\u2014an equation that is patently flawed.</span></p> <p><span>Indeed, there is every reason to believe that the U.S. policy toward Iraq has actually undermined the fight against terrorism. The Iraqi war and subsequent occupation have forced us and our allies (like Spain) to divert valuable military and intelligence resources away from fighting al Qaeda.  The recent bombings are proof that U.S. attempts to disrupt al Qaeda networks have not been successful. The utter paucity of pre-attack intelligence is particularly disheartening.</span></p> <p><span>Not only has Iraq become a resource sinkhole, it has also become a breeding ground for new terrorists. The invasion managed to piss off a lot of potentially dangerous people. It has provoked strident anti-Americanism in the Islamic world and alienated us from millions of  Muslims at a time when we should be most concerned with fostering good will. That al Qaeda and other radical Islamic fundamentalists should be so invested in the fate of Saddam\u2019s secular state demonstrates just how polarized matters have become.</span></p> <p><span><i>Sasha Post \u201905 is a social studies concentrator in Adams House.

But newer schools of equal and larger sizes, which continue to receive far less than their New England counterparts, have called on the DOE for more equitable funding.</span></p> <p><span>The money in question, $3.3 billion in campus-based financial aid, is allocated to universities which then distribute the funds to students as part of their financial aid packages.</span></p> <p><span>The federal government\u2019s $6.1 million award to Harvard represents roughly 8 percent of the College\u2019s financial aid budget this fiscal year. While this aid varies year to year based on an allocation formula, Harvard consistently receives a large chunk of the total awarded by the federal government.</span></p> <p><span>But the University of California, Los Angeles, with an undergraduate population four times larger than Harvard\u2019s, received just $5.7 million in campus-based financial aid this fiscal year. Most large universities outside New England face similar situations, according to DOE statistics.</span></p> <p><span>How much Harvard or its peer institutions might lose under a reallocation of funding remains unclear, but each university could see cuts of several million dollars. A Harvard financial aid initiative announced last month, which eliminated tuition for students whose parents earn less than $40,000, cost the University $2 million.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard financial aid officers did not return requests for comment last night.</span></p> <p><span>Kevin Casey, Harvard\u2019s top lobbyist in Washington, D.C., said yesterday the University was more interested in growing the entire pie than protecting its own slice. But he declined to take a position on the reallocation of campus-based financial aid.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhat we\u2019re going to do is watch as this issue unfolds and communicate with people on the Hill as we go along,\u201d Casey said.</span></p> <p><span>University President Lawrence H. Summers could not be reached for comment on the issue last night.</span></p> <p><span>The Bush administration\u2019s proposal for next fiscal year\u2019s DOE budget calls the current distribution of campus-based aid \u201cdisproportionate\u201d and \u201cinequitable.\u201d It asks for the revision of allocation formulas as soon as next school year.</span></p> <p><span>The awards, however, have already been decided for next fiscal year, which corresponds to next school year. The government will release the figures to the public on April 1.</span></p> <p><span>Any change in those formulas would require Congressional approval, and reaction on Capitol Hill has largely split along regional lines. New England Sen. Edward M. Kennedy \u201954-\u201956, D-Mass., and Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., have both said they oppose the reallocation of campus-based financial aid.</span></p> <p><span>Kennedy\u2019s alma mater\u2014Harvard\u2014and several other universities in his constituency would almost certainly face a cut in their funding if the aid were to be reallocated. Boston University received $7.6 million this fiscal year, while Northeastern University gained $7.1 million. Those figures represent some of the largest allocations in the country.</span></p> <p><span>In a statement last week, Kennedy criticized the broader White House financial aid initiative, which places greater emphasis on student loans.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis Republican plan hurts students and helps banks rake in bigger profits,\u201d Kennedy said in the statement.</span></p> <p><span>Gregg, who chairs the Senate committee which oversees financial aid allocation, has repeatedly said the funds are correctly distributed.</span></p> <p><span>Casey, who has been representing Harvard in Washington, D.C., said the political atmosphere in the capital has been more contentious in recent months.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cElections years are always where the rhetoric becomes more heated,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>And he said the University\u2019s interests were not necessarily a priority among legislators.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMembers of Congress aren\u2019t necessarily moved by impacts\u2014positive or negative\u2014on Harvard.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff writer Zachary M.

Kennedy Jr. Forum Friday afternoon.</span></p> <p><span>In the forum, entitled \u201cRed States v. Blue States: America\u2019s Cultural Divide,\u201d Greenberg lamented the division of the country into two partisan camps and its negative impact on political discussion. He argued that political strategists increasingly appeal to the party faithful, exacerbating the polarization. The divide is the subject of his new book, The Two Americas: Our Current Political Deadlock and How to Break It.</span></p> <p><span>Greenberg, who advised the presidential campaign of Bill Clinton in1992  and Al Gore \u201969 in 2000, as well as many international leaders, said devoted Democrats and Republicans have profoundly different worldviews. \u201cIt\u2019s not about issues,\u201d Greenberg said. \u201cThis politics is about a way of life.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>He described the conservative bloc as representing tradition, firm principles of right and wrong and an emphasis on the individual and markets, while the liberal group focuses on empowering the individual, diversity and tolerance.</span></p> <p><span>David Gergen, professor at the Kennedy School of Government and director of Harvard\u2019s Center for Public Leadership, sat aside Greenberg for the duration of what was essentially an exchange between two major players in presidential politics. Gergen himself served as an adviser to U.S. presidents Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford, Ronald Reagan and Clinton.</span></p> <p><span>Greenberg said the political strategy of President Bush, as directed by chief political adviser Karl Rove, is to excite the conservative base on key issues and use select initiatives to reach out to certain targeted groups. He said tax cuts, farm subsidies and aggressive positions on social issues such as abortion and gay marriage are specifically directed at business interests, rural voters and white evangelicals\u2014three key elements of the base. He said Bush administration policies on education, immigration reform and prescription drugs are designed to capture votes from suburban women, Hispanics and seniors, respectively.</span></p> <p><span>Asked by Gergen to discuss Clinton\u2019s political strategies, of which Greenberg was at the center as a lead pollster and strategist, Greenberg quipped, \u201cOurs was all high-minded. There never were any tactics.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Reflecting on the current political climate, Gergen said the conventional notion in presidential elections of appealing to the base in primaries and to the center in the general election has recently been challenged by the idea of focusing on the base throughout the whole process due to greater partisanship and the even division.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s wholesome politics, but I think it\u2019s real,\u201d Greenberg said. \u201cThe people in the middle have been forced to choose between these two blocs that are mostly playing base politics.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>His advice to Democrats: \u201cDon\u2019t play this game.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI\u2019m basically urging Democrats to escape by not winning group-by-group, but by taking on larger issues,\u201d Greenberg said.</span></p> <p><span>Greenberg said he feels many issues are constricted from the national debate because of the deadlock, citing inequality, health care, globalization and the environment.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis kind of politics can only deal with these issues incrementally, on the margins, and leaves it out of the debate,\u201d Greenberg said during a presentation and discussion at the Coop following the forum.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI wrote [The Two Americas] because I don\u2019t think our politics can deal with the issues that face the country,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Greenberg encourages the parties to think not just in terms of \u201ctactics\u201d but to address major issues that may cut across party lines. With the electorate so evenly divided, however, he said he isn\u2019t optimistic that the parties will think in terms broader than the tactical.</span></p> <p><span>He suggests Democrats discuss economic inequality and raising middle-class incomes, emphasizing opportunity and thinking of themselves as \u201cJFK Democrats\u201d\u2014focused on how to make all Americans share in the national prosperity. He said he feels that Republicans are best served by using a \u201crenewed Reaganism\u201d as their paradigm.</span></p> <p><span>In addition to his work on Democratic presidential campaigns, Greenberg worked for scores of other domestic campaigns and in the Clinton White House. He has served as a polling guru and political adviser to world leaders such as British Prime Minister Tony Blair, former South African President Nelson Mandela, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis is not someone who comes to politics and takes politics lightly,\u201d Gergen said.</span></p>"}

Melton specifically, for \u201c[showing] no reluctance to shelve ethical considerations to be at the forefront of stem cell research.\u201d \u00a0Furthermore, he claims that, \u201c[Harvard] is already confident in its answers to moral questions\u2014namely, that such questions are not important and need not be seriously considered before proceeding.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>On the contrary, after having taken a course in stem cell biology and cloning from Melton, a member of the National Academy of Sciences, earlier this year (Molecular and Cellular Biology 125, \u201cStem Cells and Cloning\u201d), I can attest to his careful and thoughtful contemplation of the matter. \u00a0In fact, the course\u2019s abstract in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Courses of Instruction specifically states that \u201cethical and political considerations will not be ignored.\u201d Indeed, in lieu of lecture one day, there was an hour-and-a-half-long discussion about the moral and ethical implications of both reproductive and therapeutic cloning. That he, personally and as a scientist, has come to the conclusion that therapeutic cloning is morally acceptable does not implicitly warrant condemnation, any more than President Bush\u2019s decision to freeze federal funds for such research deserves commendation. That being said, Adomanis and others have a right to be critical about progressivism\u2019s potential disregard for proper ethical consideration, as evidenced by the few scientists around the globe currently attempting to clone human babies. However, none of that research is being done here at Harvard, nor will it in the future. \u00a0In fact, several years ago Melton himself was present, with Sen. Edward M. Kennedy \u201954-\u201956, D-Mass. and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., at the announcement ceremony for legislation specifically banning research into human reproductive cloning.

{"title": "Running Out of Context | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>In the middle of a book of short sayings and poems, the great Lebanese poet Khalil Gibran (1883-1931) wrote, \u201cHalf of what I am telling you has no meaning. But I am telling it to you so that you will understand the meaning of the other half.\u201d It is a defense of the importance of context and it is timely today. In a presidential election year, context is as acutely necessary as it is rare.</span></p> <p><span>We often hear the word used, typically in the maligned politician\u2019s plea that his absurd-sounding quote was \u201ctaken out of context.\u201d Watch TV news, and you may begin to feel like the whole election is out of context, and it\u2019s going to be up to the voter to put it all together. The very structure of television media minimizes context, since only the skeleton of a story can survive the cutting that it takes to reduce a complex issue into a two minute \u201cpackage\u201d or, worse, a 15-second \u201ctell.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>A few years ago, in the context of a lengthy and fascinating videotaped deposition, Bill Clinton\u2019s famous remark that a lot \u201cdepends on what the meaning of the word \u2018is\u2019 is\u201d was a clever response to the question put to him. Clinton had been asked if there \u201cis\u201d a relationship with Monica Lewinsky, and had felt free to say no because the relationship had ended. He hadn\u2019t volunteered any more information, of course, largely because he rightly suspected that it was a trick question designed to get him to lie under oath (this incredible piece of context was confirmed too late to save the nation from impeachment). His sarcastic remark on the video was his way of pointing out that he hadn\u2019t lied, even though he hadn\u2019t been forthcoming. But out of context, it came to symbolize something else we all felt about the slippery president, and the sentence will go down in history with an unintended meaning.</span></p> <p><span>Dick Cheney, for one, seems keenly aware of the context effect, and has learned to use it to great advantage. Last Wednesday, in an important speech mostly blasted out of the news cycle by another suicide bombing in Iraq, Cheney took issue with the claim of Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., that soldiers who want body armor and other needed equipment have to purchase it on eBay, because the military does not provide it. But Cheney didn\u2019t refute the claim at all. Instead, he pointed out that Kerry voted against an appropriation of $87 billion requested by the president for the Iraq effort, giving the impression that the lack of equipment was Kerry\u2019s fault. Cheney correctly gambled that no one would ask about the implications of the context\u2014the fact that, as he noted, the bill passed anyway. Reporters had no time to ask the question begged by the context: Why, if Bush got his Iraq money, do the troops still go without body armor? In the speech, Cheney also said Kerry spoke \u201cas if only those who openly oppose America\u2019s objectives have a chance of earning his respect.\u201d It was a stunning insinuation, given the context of Kerry\u2019s heroic war record.</span></p> <p><span>The popularity of \u201cThe Daily Show with Jon Stewart\u201d is a good example of our sensitivity to context. Unlike other nighttime political humor on the Leno-Letterman-Conan axis, Stewart relies less on jokes that begin with a nugget of news, followed by a made-up punch line. For the most part, the humor of his \u201cfake\u201d news routine lies in the fact that it\u2019s not fake at all\u2026he allows politicians and journalists to mock themselves. My friends and I often blink in disbelief at the footage Stewart collects, saying \u201cthis can\u2019t be real.\u201d But, sadly, it always is. The best laughs come when he merely rolls a tape of someone like George W. Bush saying something like, \u201cif you\u2019re going to make an accusation in the course of a presidential campaign, you ought to back it up with facts.\u201d (Bush, apparently oblivious to the irony given the context of his own relationship to accusations and facts, said this in response to Kerry\u2019s obviously accurate but woefully impolitic assertion that he knows foreign leaders who want Bush to lose.) The screen then returns to Stewart, making a stunned face at the camera, needing to say no more. The humor is in Bush\u2019s straight face, not Stewart\u2019s funny one\u2014all Stewart does is supply the context. Last year, simply showing the footage of Bush aboard the famous aircraft carrier, scored by the \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d theme song, did the work of a million mockeries before a joke was delivered.</span></p> <p><span>The emerging Medicare fiasco will be a test of how readily context can be assembled in the news media. We learned last week that the chief federal Medicare actuary was ordered, under penalty of unemployment, to withhold from Congress his knowledge that the administration was understating the Bush prescription drug bill\u2019s cost by about $150 billion. This is shocking on its own, but more so in context\u2014namely, that the bill passed by one vote after GOP leaders persuaded some opposing Congress members to change their votes on the floor. In context, these revelations mean that the administration tricked Congress into passing a bill. Reporters so far have treated this gingerly, reporting that \u201cit is possible\u201d that the bill would not have passed without the deception. In fact, enough (that is, more than one) Congress members said at the time they would have voted differently if it cost any more than they then thought, that it\u2019s more \u201cdefinite\u201d than \u201cpossible\u201d that the cheating saved the bill. Whether the context of this scandal is properly reported by the press, and internalized by the public, will be reflected in how seriously the issue is taken in coming weeks.</span></p> <p><span>The scarcity of context will be a problem for John Kerry, who is increasingly known for his \u201cnuance\u201d and deliberation. His success will largely depend on whether he can either succinctly supply context for his words and actions, or structure them so they can make sense on their own. Unfortunately, the luxury of crafting words in broad layers, saying things that make sense only in light of the \u201cother half,\u201d is one thing that separates the poet from the politician.</span></p> <p><span><i>Peter P.M.

On about June 13, according to The Washington Post, Foster says he told Thomas A. Scully, the Bush-appointed Medicare administrator, that the White House numbers were many billions off the mark. Foster also says he sent his calculations to Doug Badger, the administration\u2019s top health policy analyst, and to executives within the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).</span></p> <p><span>Ordinarily, someone in Foster\u2019s job would have gone straight to Congressional representatives with his news. Indeed, the Medicare actuary\u2019s office has a \u201ctradition of dealing directly with the legislative branch.\u201d And after all, senators and representatives were about to vote on a bill that actually cost 37 percent more than they were told.</span></p> <p><span>But Scully ordered Foster to keep quiet\u2014and, according to Foster as well as others, threatened to fire him if he didn\u2019t. Rep.

And getting even a \u201c$400 billion\u201d entitlement through the Republican Congress was a challenge. Already we know that (according to Chicago Sun-Times journalist Robert Novak) retiring Rep. Nick Smith, R-Mich., received threats because he opposes deficit spending. With the Bush-controlled House leadership\u2019s endorsement, Novak reported, Rep. Duke Cunningham, R-Calif., and others told the disloyalist that his son\u2014running in Michigan to succeed Smith\u2014would lose funding from GOP loyalists.</span></p> <p><span>But the columns and editorials that express nothing but shock, shock, shock at all the Republican hardball miss the pattern. This is the way Bush plays the game. This is the way he governs as president. Step one: Suppress dissent. Step two: If it happens anyway, punish the dissenter. Step three: Dismiss the offending facts.</span></p> <p><span>Steven J. Kelman \u201970, who directed federal procurement policy from 1993 to 1997 and is now Weatherhead professor of public management at the Kennedy School of Government, said that the Bush administration is \u201cmuch more extreme\u201d about restricting civil servants\u2019 conversations with Congress and the media than its predecessors.</span></p> <p><span>And no wonder. It seems that even those who have loyally served presidents for decades, or are members of Bush\u2019s own party, get knee-capped for exposing politically pesky realities.</span></p> <p><span>This president, like many right-wing populists before him, loves publicly knocking \u201cthe bureaucrats\u201d\u2014and there is certainly nothing immoral about that. But what about Sept. 2002, when career scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency objected to White House demands that they erase a report disproving Bush\u2019s position on global warming? According to The New York Times, Bush (step one) sent a signal that no more inconvenient science could be released, (step two) publicly demeaned the report\u2019s writers and (step three) had the White House-hired environmental policy director repudiate the report\u2019s substance.</span></p> <p><span>And what about Sept. 2001, when Richard Clarke, Bush\u2019s top anti-terrorism adviser, who has served in national security positions for four presidents, opposed the immediate push to bomb Iraq, not al Qaeda? According to an interview broadcast Sunday on \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d Bush (step one) listened only to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Vice President Dick Cheney, (step two) called those who opposed the unrelated Iraq operation \u201cnot interested in the security of the American people\u201d and (step three) pushed the CIA to minimize bothersome intelligence.</span></p> <p><span>And what about the Medicare cover-up of June 2003?</span></p> <p><span>A winning game plan for Democrats: (step one) discuss the dissent, (step two) welcome the dissenters and (step three) expose the facts.</span></p> <p><span><i>Brian M.

{"title": "Spring Season at the Loeb | Arts | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Michelle Chun", "body": "<p><span>A typical run-through of <i>Top Girls</i>, one of several productions currently rehearsing for the Loeb Experimental Theatre, is initiated with an unusual ritual. The largely female cast and crew face each other in a circle and begin doing stretches. They start off with a relatively simple assortment of nerve-defraying arm extensions and breathing exercises, but soon begin emitting a guttural tribal chant. In moments, the scene of calm has erupted into a fervent sequence of chest-beating, head-twirling and tongue-extending, all done in approximate unison by ten normally rational individuals. Director Aoife E. Spillane-Hinks \u201906 orchestrates the catharsis, encouraging her cast to relax and \u201clet out their bellies.\u201d The ceremony finally ends with a \u201cshakedown,\u201d where limbs are spastically shaken one by one as everyone counts down to zero.</span></p> <p><span>What exactly does this do for the <i>Top Girls</i>? Before these exercises, the cast was a screwball swarm of hysterical giggles and rowdy line readings. But now they are firmly seated around a dinner table, their focus immersed in the performances and the improvement of their as yet imperfect accents. For the members involved in this production, there is a time for inanity and a time for gravity, and amidst the flurry of vaguely cultish behaviors, they find that clear transition.</span></p> <p><span><b>THE EX IN FULL SWING</b></span></p> <p><span>For the players of Top Girls and other shows under the auspices of the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club (HRDC), the Spring 2004 season is well underway at the Loeb Experimental Theatre. Since late February, the Ex stage has been graced by improv troupe the Immediate Gratification Players (IGP) and their <i>Comedy Unthunk</i> show, as well as brief runs of Betrayal, directed by Benjamin J. Toff \u201905, who is also a Crimson executive, and <i>Private Eyes</i>, directed by Alli C. Smith \u201906</span></p> <p><span>Currently playing in an extended run through Sunday is <i>Roberto Zucco</i>, the brainchild of director Ben D. Margo \u201903 -\u201904. Based on a British translation of French playwright Bernard-Marie Koltes\u2019 final work, <i>Zucco</i> tells the story of its titular serial killer who murders, burgles and rapes apparently without motive. John C. Dewis stars as the enigmatic Zucco, alongside Sara L. Bartel \u201906 in the female lead role of Girl.</span></p> <p><span>Margo says he was initially attracted to the play for its \u201clittle boy against the world story.\u201d He adds that he also admired, \u201cthe clarity of the script. It\u2019s pretty direct; not much dicking around with subtext.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But for supposedly lucid writing, the show itself has drawn a multitude of interpretations from its cast and crew. Co-producer Alex H. Bush \u201905-\u201906 emphasizes <i>Roberto Zucco</i>\u2019s melodramatic aspects, noting that \u201cit needs to be theater. There\u2019s a lot of cruelty in the way the characters talk to each other that\u2019s very theatrical and very unrealistic.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The play\u2019s dramaturg, Scott R. Wilson \u201904, sees parallels to the current social climate. \u201cOf course Zucco was a killer, but it\u2019s not too much of a stretch to say he was a terrorist in a way,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cThroughout the play, there are these enigmatic pronouncements that Zucco makes about being a secret agent. We\u2019re left in the dark as to whether or not that\u2019s the case. But the government has taken on a sort of role with the Patriot Act, where there\u2019s a lot of room to believe today that someone you know could be working for the government.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps the most interesting interpretation belongs to Alan D. Zackheim \u201906, who plays the dual roles of Old Gentleman and Girl\u2019s Brother. \u201cThe show itself is in a lot of ways a reflection of Ben Margo\u2019s personality,\u201d says Zackheim. \u201cA lot of his sense of humor, things that he doesn\u2019t necessarily expect the audience to get but just finds really awesome, he\u2019s more than happy to throw into the show.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Much of the show relies on the murky visual ambience created by the production\u2019s lighting and set designers, a difficult task given the limited rehearsal time afforded on the actual Ex stage. After rehearsing in various spaces for a month, the players are only given three days to pull all of the diverse elements of the production together.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cEarly on in the process, rehearsal on any given evening can be up in the quad or down by the river or in some of the rehearsal rooms at HRDC, so you\u2019re always transposing this idea of a set around with you,\u201d says Zackheim. \u201cIt\u2019s always one of the big frustrations that all college theater has.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>However, the participants assert that the transition has been natural, if a little hectic, and their faith in Ben Margo\u2019s direction is evident. \u201cHe\u2019s really interested in creating the piece that he wants to create,\u201d says Zackheim of Margo\u2019s vision. \u201cIt\u2019s not his goal to try to please anybody.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>As <i>Roberto Zucco</i> wraps up, the creators of <i>Top Girls</i> will be putting the final touches onto their show, which runs from April 8-17. The play\u2019s conceit involves a successful early \u201980s businesswoman who invites a number of literary and historical figures to dinner to celebrate a recent promotion. The ensemble includes a Japanese courtesan, a character from Canterbury Tales, a female pope, a woman from a Bruegel painting and a Victorian world traveler. Largely set around a single dining table, the six women discuss their past exploits, often finding themselves faced with the problem of defining their \u201cwomanhood\u201d independent of its conflicts with \u201cmanhood.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Spillane-Hinks was introduced to the material years ago, when she literally stumbled upon the play. \u201cThe way that I discovered <i>Top Girls</i> was that I stepped on it one day at my house. So I picked it up, and I remember reading this at fourteen and thinking, \u2018This is amazing.\u2019\u201d</span></p> <p><span>She began preparing for the show as far back as summer break, gradually building a staff of familiar faces from past shows. \u201cBasically it\u2019s a whole process of courtship,\u201d she says. \u201cSo you convince everyone how incredible the show is, how incredible the ideas are, how together you are as a director.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>A first-time director for HRDC, Spillane-Hinks knew landing the show at the Ex might prove a bit of a challenge. She admits that if the Ex hadn\u2019t accepted <i>Top Girls</i>, she couldn\u2019t have performed it at another venue due to the considerable resources specific to the stage. However, the process of application, admittance and now direction has been an incredibly \u201cIn acting, you work on your technique and your analysis, but the fact is the director has the ultimate say,\u201d she says. \u201cSo to have that kind of intellectual agency in the process, as the director, it\u2019s really wonderful.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Though the show constantly grapples with weighty themes, Spillane-Hinks quells any fears that <i>Top Girls</i> is merely an intellectual discourse rather than character-based theater. She says that during her first reading, she was \u201cstruck by the simultaneously huge issues of politics and culture and gender that were going on in the play while at the same time, the basic human relationships were not compromised.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Co-producer Katherine J. Thompson \u201905 also highlights the show\u2019s humor, drawn largely from the anachronistic clash of the characters. \u201cIt\u2019s hilarious and at times confusing, but in this great way where it\u2019s a mix of ideas sort of coming at you from all directions,\u201d says Thompson. \u201cIt\u2019s also got amazing accents. I would almost see it just for that.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><b>MAINSTAGE MADNESS</b></span></p> <p><span>The Mainstage, the Loeb\u2019s other, significantly larger venue will kick off their spring season the week following spring break. In addition to the musical <i>Sunday in the Park with George</i>, which will run from the final week of April until May 8th, the Mainstage will also house a fresh take on Tom Stoppard\u2019s popular play, <i>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead</i> for a two-week run from April 9-17.</span></p> <p><span>The Mainstage\u2014arguably the most coveted and most technically challenging theatre space available for undergraduates\u2014has been embraced by director Jeremy W. Blocker \u201804, who brings experience as a producer, two-time Loeb Ex director and former HRDC vice president to the show.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cExperience is key for any director trying to tackle the Mainstage,\u201d Blocker wrote in an e-mail. And to that end, Blocker says he has emphasized preparing and planning productive rehearsals and creating an atmosphere that allows for the creativity of collaborating members to flourish as crucial jobs for a director in any setting.</span></p> <p><span>But Blocker says his experiences in the Harvard theater community have proven especially useful in directing the Mainstage, as it has enabled him to seek out assistance when he needs it, from those with greater familiarity with the space.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI have experience asking for help and I know who I can turn to in various situations. When it comes down to it, every student director is just that\u2014a student,\u201d he says.Among those Blocker turns to are the professionals at the American Repertory Theatre (ART), who share the space with undergraduates during the regular season and work with students in mounting the Mainstage.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult space to tackle, and it helps to have a staff that knows the territory and a cast that is prepared to face the challenge,\u201d he says. Blocker\u2019s production team include Mainstage veterans Sarah E. Curtis \u201905 and Jess M. Matthews \u201905, and Executive Producer Claire A. Pasternack \u201905, who is also a Crimson editor.</span></p> <p><span>The cast also includes seasoned Harvard theater community members, including Geordie F. Broadwater \u201904, who directed last semester\u2019s Mainstage show, Temptation, and Bobby A. Hodgson \u201905, the current president of the HRDC.</span></p> <p><span>Hodgson and Broadwater star as Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, respectively, taking on two of contemporary theater\u2019s most celebrated antiheros. Stoppard\u2019s black comedy and one of his most popular works to date, follows Hamlet\u2019s hapless and disoriented friends who wander through the Danish court, between England and their imminent death\u2014in events that seem always controlled by forces beyond their control.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s a play about feelings of powerlessness and ignorance of the world around you,\u201d Hodgson says. The themes of play will be reflected not only in the interactions between actors, he says, but in the inventive stage set-up that will incorporate trick staircases and M.C. Escher-inspired backdrops.</span></p> <p><span>\u201c[<i>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead</i>] is a difficult piece\u2014something that we are rediscovering in rehearsal every day-but it is an accessible one,\u201d Blocker says.</span></p> <p><span>He adds that \u201cthe space allows us to fully create this world in which we are setting the play\u2014a world that grows out of confusion and fear in which up is down and down is up and our protagonists have no control.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><b>TECH BOOM</b></span></p> <p><span>In order to address the \u201ctech crunch,\u201d or the shortage of technical assistance for various Loeb productions, the HRDC introduced a new tech requirement this fall that obligates members to contribute to the technical aspect of a production during the semester.</span></p> <p><span>The tech requirement was implemented by former technical liaison for the HRDC E. Peyton Sherwood \u201904, who said the idea for the requirement came from discussions within the community. Attendees at one of the HRDC\u2019s open meetings raised the idea when the discussion turned to the perennial tech crunch experienced by shows, especially as performance time approaches. Sherwood said he and other HRDC members had previously considered implementing such a requirement, but was not sure it would have enough support from the community at large.</span></p> <p><span>Now in its second semester in effect, the requirement has been received with largely positive response from actors and techies alike. According to Sherwood, 90 percent of the 97 actors in the Loeb participated last semester, whereas in the past, only approximately 18 percent of actors were similarly involved.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere\u2019s a little less mad stress about making sure that technically [productions] would happen, and that allows for more thoughtfulness than might have been possible in past seasons,\u201d Hodgson says. Technical tasks that fulfill the requirement include carpentry, lighting, loading sets, and sundry other tasks that many productions scramble to complete with the dearth of consistent technical hands and time constraints.</span></p> <p><span>Despite the added responsibility for actors involved with the Loeb, the response from actors has remained largely positive. For Spillane-Hanks, a regular actor and light designer before her directing stint, the requirement has not affected casting for her show, though she says she realizes that some members of the community have reacted to the requirement with greater reservation.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI met some actors who really are skeptical about it,\u201d she says, \u201cwho say \u2018I\u2019m here to act. I respect tech people, but that\u2019s not what I\u2019m here to do.\u2019\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But many actors also cite the benefits of contributing to the technical aspect of outside productions as an experience that enriches their own understanding of theater and the theater community at Harvard in general.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMy sense is that many of the actors view the requirement as a way of giving back to the community by working on each others\u2019 shows. The requirement helps to tighten the community while playing a large part in filling the under-stocked tech positions,\u201d says Blase E. Ur \u201907, Sherwood\u2019s successor as technical liaison.</span></p> <p><span>Both Ur and Sherwood also point out that requiring HRDC members to work on other productions throughout the semester has opened up more avenues for contact, and in some cases, has helped create ties for future working relationships. Zackheim says he enjoys becoming part of a new cast and crew when he works towards his tech requirement. \u201cIt\u2019s more a chance for the people in the limited world of Harvard theater to interact and co-mingle with each other,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>Hodgson says the HRDC plans on further streamlining the tech requirement process, by offering fuller descriptions of available positions and making sure a balanced number of volunteers signs up for each show.</span></p> <p><span>Though the tech problem remains one of the most important issues Hodgson says he and the HRDC board will address in the coming months, he insists that improvements will come largely from building on the successes of the tech requirement.</span></p> <p><span>In addition to addressing technical shortages, Hodgson says he hopes to institutionalize the Visiting Director Project for subsequent semesters. He says student-actors have spoken often of the invaluable experience of working for Lorenzaccio in the fall under the auspices of professional visiting director Jay Scheib.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe joy of that project is that every new director you get every year will bring a totally different view to acting and theater to the production,\u201d he says. Next year, he says the HRDC anticipates Scott Zigler, an ART professional and Lecturer on Dramatic Arts to participate in the program.</span></p> <p><span>Hodgson says he will also work to include expanding academic courses offerings in the dramatic arts for undergraduates. Though this semester saw a broader range of course offered, including courses on production dramaturgy and vocal production for the stage, Hodgson says there will be a push for more courses next semester. \u201cI\u2019m excited about this season,\u201d Hodgson says. \u201cWe try to do our best to bring whatever people get excited about and make it happen.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff writer Michelle Chun can be reached at chun2@fas.harvard.edu.</i></span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Ben B.

{"title": "Students React to Spanish Bombings | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>While for most Harvard students the terrorist bombings in Madrid last week were mere headlines, for those who have lived or studied in Spain, they were every bit as devastating as the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.</span></p> <p><span>The ten bombs that tore through 90 miles of commuter line during rush hour on the morning of March 11 have killed 202 people and wounded at least 1,200 others. Yesterday, Spanish police arrested five more suspects, making a total of 11 in custody for the bombings.</span></p> <p><span>Zoie O. Watson \u201905, who is currently studying at the University of Madrid, was in her apartment located several miles from the site of bombing when it happened.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt has had more of an impact on me than Sept. 11,\u201d Watson said. \u201cMadrid is a city that I have come to call my own, and a city that I love.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Sarah L. Thomas \u201904, who studied in Madrid during fall 2002 and worked for Let\u2019s Go Spain last summer, agreed.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI felt a lot more personally involved in this because Madrid is the place that I have spent the most time in outside of Boston,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cIt hit home much more than Sept. 11.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Those contacted described having visceral reactions upon hearing about the bombing, recalling their own experiences with Spanish train stations.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhen I found out about the bombing, I was petrified, and I didn\u2019t go outside all day,\u201d Watson said. \u201cI was in my apartment, but the night before I was a metro stop away from Atocha.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Atocha, which was one of the primary bombing targets, is Madrid\u2019s largest and most important train station.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI was completely shocked. It was a block away from where I used to live in Madrid. My first two thoughts were about the people I know who are still there, and the elementary school that is on the same block\u201d said Miranda E. Dugi \u201905, who studied at the Universidad de Carlos III in Madrid last fall.</span></p> <p><span>Sophie L. Gonick \u201905, who studied in Madrid last fall and is also a Crimson editor, said that she was \u201cfrightened\u201d and \u201chorrified\u201d upon hearing about the bombings.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt was a very personal reaction because it is an area I know really well and that I passed through every single day,\u201d Gonick said. \u201cI really know that train station, and I can\u2019t imagine being in that train station in an emergency.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><b>A SILVER LINING</b></span></p> <p><span>Despite the devastation of the bombings, some said that they found a small glimmer of hope in the political shake up that followed the attacks.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI am happy that the Left has now won the elections. That\u2019s the only positive outcome I can see out of all of this,\u201d Gonick said.</span></p> <p><span>The bombings took place three days prior to the general elections in Madrid which resulted in the ouster of the conservative Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar in favor of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero of the Socialist Party.</span></p> <p><span>Aznar, who adamantly supported the U.S.-led war in Iraq, was heavily blamed for the bombings which have now been linked to the al Qaeda terrorist group.</span></p> <p><span>Bradley S. Epps, Professor of Romance Languages and Literatures, said that Aznar lied to the Spanish people about the war in Iraq and tried to convince the people that ETA, a Basque separatist group, was responsible for the bombing.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe misinformation and suppression of information was almost immediate. There was a knee-jerk reaction here as if it was impossible to imagine that this was a global terrorist attack,\u201d Epps said.</span></p> <p><span>Watson echoed Epps\u2019 statement, noting the confusion that ensued in the hours after the bombing</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThey immediately decided it was ETA, the Basque terrorist group. It was scary because people didn\u2019t know who to believe or what the situation was,\u201d Watson said.</span></p> <p><span>Epps compared the lies made by the former Spanish government to statements made by President Bush.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe Popular party has lied to the Spanish people just as George W. Bush and his cronies have lied to the American people. Their foreign policy is built on the manipulation of truth and lies, and that is certainly how the majority of the Spanish people see it,\u201d Epps said.</span></p> <p><span><b>CLOSE TO HOME</b></span></p> <p><span>Even with the many parallels between the situation in Madrid and that in the United States, students and professors said that they were disappointed with the general apathy of the American people.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt was very upsetting I think because the American reaction wasn\u2019t as strong as I thought it would be,\u201d Thomas said.</span></p> <p><span>Epps attributed this apathy to U.S. arrogance and feelings of supremacy.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe U.S. is one of the most narcissistic and self-absorbed countries on earth. That is one of the effects of power,\u201d Epps said.</span></p> <p><span>However, others disagreed, noting that their friends here have been very supportive in the wake of the tragedy.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cEveryone who I know who knew I was in Madrid contacted me about whether or not my friends were safe,\u201d Dugi said. \u201cProportionally you are not going to get the same reaction out of people just because it was not in the United States. People have taken an interest not just in the event, but the context surrounding it as well.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>While many felt emotionally tied to the tragedy, no one interviewed said they personally knew anybody who was a victim of the attack. Some attributed this to a strike at the University of Madrid, which deterred many students and professors from taking the train to the school that morning.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI was lucky enough to get in touch with everybody who I knew in Madrid a couple of hours later to see that they were okay,\u201d Dugi said.</span></p> <p><span>Watson said some of those who had the most trouble coping with the bombings were students from New York.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI have heard of a lot of students here who are from New York who have started to have panic attacks because it hit so close to home,\u201d Watson said.</span></p> <p><span>Despite the enormity of the tragedy, many said that they would definitely return to Spain in the near future.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI have been going to Spain for a long time, and I have people I love there. I am no more nervous about going to Spain than I am about going to New York or walking through downtown Boston,\u201d Epps said.</span></p> <p><span>Watson said that her fear of terrorism extends beyond Spain.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI am not afraid about being in Spain. It is just a general uneasiness about the state of the world. I don\u2019t know if there is a safe place to be,\u201d Watson said.</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Material from the Associated Press was used in this story.</i></span></p>"}
{"title": "Brzezinski Warns Against Unilateralism | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Sarah E.F. Milov", "body": "<p><span>Former Cold War politician Zbigniew Brzezinski spoke about the dangers of American unilateralism and its potential to spark a terrorist backlash at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum last night.</span></p> <p><span>In a critical speech entitled \u201cAmerican Power and Global Security,\u201d Brzezinski talked about how America must secure its interests by acting cooperatively and avoid \u201cgeostrategic catastrophe.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe U.S. today is the only global superpower. It\u2019s just a fact,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Brzezinski, a native of Poland, spoke with the authority of someone intimately familiar with American foreign policy. He served as National Security adviser under former President Jimmy Carter.</span></p> <p><span>However, in a departure from his reputation as a hawkish Cold War hardliner, Brzezinski advocated a vision of a softer, gentler United States that \u201cinfuses globalization with humane content.\u201d In Brzezinski\u2019s vision, the United States should abandon its trend toward single-handed action, exemplified by the Iraq conflict.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cUnilateral missionary zeal is a prescription for American isolation,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Brzezinski couldn\u2019t resist certain allusions to Soviet-era hostilities. While the Balkans were fought over during the Cold War, Brzezinski dubbed Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, Israel and Palestine the \u201cNew Global Balkans\u201d due to America\u2019s interests there.</span></p> <p><span>In order to deal effectively with these threats, Brzezinski argued that the United States must cooperate with its traditional European allies, without whom it would \u201csimply not be able to cope.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>He also stressed the importance of a transfer of power within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), whereby the United States acts as an equal partner with the European members of the alliance.</span></p> <p><span>According to Brzezinski, legitimate organizations such as NATO should replace ad-hoc coalitions, which represent alliances based on \u201cexpediency and sometimes manipulation.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Much of the rest of the speech warned of the backlash against perceived American arrogance in foreign affairs.</span></p> <p><span>According to Brzezinski, terrorists are often poor people who are \u201cacutely aware of their denigration\u201d and who are resentful of wealthy Americans.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cTerrorism is a symptom of globalization generated by Americans, abetted by Americans and propounded by Americans,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>He said that this envy is most dangerous when attached to a unified doctrine \u201cto fill the vacuum of Marx.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The new ideology, Brzezinski said, will have an \u201canti-American, anti-globalization thrust.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Brzezinski was similarly critical of the Bush administration. He was especially vocal in his admonishment of the administration\u2019s definition of threat.</span></p> <p><span>He warned against defining threats in theological terms that draw upon popular fears of an abstract evil.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe should avoid stamping conflict as religious,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will create a religious gulf, the sharp edge of which will turn against us.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Brzezinski said he was not surprised that the recent terrorists responsible for the Madrid bombings made statements referencing the Crusades.</span></p> <p><span>He also pointed out that after Iraq, the current administration has been suffering from a loss of international credibility.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe isolation of the U.S., the loss of credibility of the U.S. will produce countervailing forces that will push us collectively into growing and increasingly significant chaos,\u201d Brzezinski said.</span></p> <p><span>Brzezinski speech was met with extended applause.</span></p> <p><span>Alexander N. Rossolimo, the president of the Mass. think-tank, the Center for Security and Social Progress, said he agreed with Brzezinski.</span></p> <p><span>Rossolimo appreciated the indictment of the Bush administration as \u201cnot doing things for the welfare of mankind.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to reading his book,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Brzezinski\u2019s latest book, The Choice: Global Domination or Global Leadership, was published earlier this year.</span></p> <p><span>Paul Bodnar, a first-year Ph.D. student in government, was similarly impressed.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis speech was a good reminder of why its good to listen to people who have experience. Like his book, this was a clear, precise view of American foreign policy,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>But not all listeners said they were stunned by Brzezinski\u2019s ideas.</span></p> <p><span>While Jason Larkin, a Ph.D. candidate in comparative politics, conceded that Brzezinski gave a \u201cgood speech,\u201d these were all things he said he had heard before.</span></p> <p><span>But Larkin added that it is a message worth repeating.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt was nice to hear strong opinions not couched in political correctness.

Bush.</i></span></p> <p><span>Singer told the crowd that friends and colleagues initially responded incredulously when he announced he would write about Bush\u2019s ethics. Some called the topic \u201can oxymoron,\u201d while others joked that \u201cit must be a very short book,\u201d Singer said.</span></p> <p><span>But Singer said that Bush\u2019s rhetoric has generated a heightened emphasis on ethics in politics.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cOverwhelmingly he uses the word \u2018evil\u2019 as a noun,\u201d Singer said. \u201cWhen you use \u2018evil\u2019 as a noun, you\u2019re referring to it as something substantive. It\u2019s like there\u2019s a force out there, and we have to do something to defeat it.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Singer said Bush\u2019s moralistic language appeals to voters even beyond the evangelical Christian constituency.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cOne of his strongest campaign planks was that he was going to be an ethical leader,\u201d Singer said. \u201cThat was crucial in getting him elected\u2014or whatever word you want to use.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Audience members suggested in a question-and-answer session after the speech that Bush\u2019s moralistic language may be a cynical political ploy. But according to Singer, \u201cif we want to have a real debate about the president\u2019s policies, we should consider the possibility that he is sincere.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Singer sought to highlight inconsistencies in Bush\u2019s moral reasoning.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cBush has said he sees it as his role as president of the U.S. to promote a \u2018culture of life\u2019 at home and abroad,\u201d Singer said, noting that Bush\u2019s first prime-time television address focused on embryonic stem cell research.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThese embryos are obviously not sentient beings,\u201d Singer said. \u201cThey are clusters of cells. They have no anatomy. They have no brain. They can\u2019t feel anything.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere\u2019s a gross disparity between the respect President Bush is showing for a small number of human embryos and the disregard he is showing for a large number of Iraqi civilians,\u201d Singer said.</span></p> <p><span>And Singer charged that while Bush claims to support states\u2019 rights, he has sought to bar Oregon from allowing assisted suicide, block California from legalizing marijuana for medical purposes and prevent Massachusetts from granting marriage licenses to gay couples.</span></p> <p><span>Singer described a July 14, 2003 Oval Office press conference at which Bush claimed that Saddam Hussein had shut weapons inspectors out of Iraq\u2014a claim Singer said is specious.</span></p> <p><span>\u201c[Bush] didn\u2019t look like he was drunk or on drugs, but it\u2019s hard to explain what else was going on,\u201d Singer said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cNothing\u2014he\u2019s stupid,\u201d one audience member interjected.</span></p> <p><span>Bush-bashing continued throughout the question-and-answer session, and none of the audience members challenged Singer\u2019s political views.</span></p> <p><span>The famously-contrarian philosopher said he isn\u2019t used to being so well-received.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAt last, I wanted to have a lot of people agree with me,\u201d Singer quipped in explaining his motivation for writing his latest book.</span></p> <p><span>Princeton\u2019s appointment of Singer to the DeCamp chair of bioethics in 1999 sparked an uproar among the school\u2019s alumni.

{"title": "What Have We Won? | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>One year ago, 1,500 Harvard students, faculty, staff and community members walked out of lectures and seminars, day jobs and high school classes, forgoing business as usual on the first day of the bombing of Iraq.  As bombs rained down on Baghdad for a 24-hour straight saturation bombardment to kick off the U.S. \u201cshock and awe\u201d campaign, a crowd gathered in front of the John Harvard statue for one of the largest rallies in Harvard history, followed by a march into Boston.</span></p> <p><span>On that day, there were many good reasons to oppose the war, and today, there are even more.  In the year since, no weapons of mass destruction have been found in Iraq. It is now clear that the primary justification for going to war was based on flimsy and contrived evidence. The \u201chumanitarian\u201d justification is equally suspect. Though Iraqis are now free from the despotic rule of Saddam Hussein, their country is in a state of turmoil.  Occupation has failed to provide any sort of security and is probably doing more harm than good.  As a result of the presence of American troops, the country has become a magnet for terrorist groups which have been carrying out deadly attacks on civilians. The American corporations with contracts in Iraq have also failed to improve the state of the economy or rebuild the infrastructure. And in the gravest of Iraq\u2019s losses, an estimated 20,000 Iraqi civilians and 30,000 Iraqi soldiers have died so far.</span></p> <p><span>The United States has also suffered many losses on account of the war.  six hundred soldiers have lost their lives, and the death toll is still climbing, with new deaths reported every day.  Almost $200 billion have been spent at the expense of important domestic programs, and we are currently facing the largest deficit of our generation. The American government\u2019s unilateral efforts and contempt for international law have also distanced the U.S. from the international community.  There are no signs that the world is a safer place today than it was a year ago, despite the invasion of Iraq being a part of Bush\u2019s \u201cwar on terror.\u201d One of our closest backers going into the war, Spain, recently suffered the most extensive terrorism attack in its history, in which close to 200 people died and thousands more were wounded.</span></p> <p><span>Whether we like it or not, we are all tied to this conflict in tangible ways.  As members of the Harvard community, we are inadvertently benefiting from the other war going on in Iraq, the struggle between international investors and corporations to stake out their piece of the Iraqi economy, which has been entirely restructured by the United States in the course of the occupation.  The United States has made it possible for Iraqi resources and banks to be owned and operated entirely by private contractors from every country other than Iraq itself.</span></p> <p><span>It comes as no surprise that a significant slice of the Harvard endowment is invested in defense contractors who are making increased profits as a result of the war.  As much as one-third of the monthly $3.9 billion cost of the occupation of Iraq is going to independent contractors, and Harvard has tens of millions of dollars invested in companies including Halliburton, Northrop Corp. and JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co., among others.</span></p> <p><span>It is important that we act with the same dedication and conviction that motivated us to walk out on our daily routine one year ago. Although the brunt of the destruction is over, the necessity to voice our concerns regarding the responsible reconstruction of Iraq is just as urgent now as it was during the first days of the invasion. What happens in post-war Iraq will undoubtedly have repercussions the world over, for better or for worse.</span></p> <p><span>Tomorrow, hundreds of thousands of anti-war activists, including Harvard students, will again be coming together in New York City, this time to protest the colonial occupation of Iraq. It is as important to keep our sights on the future as to remember what has passed. We must not forget that the conflict continues despite the rhetoric of the war being won. Our responsibility as citizens of the occupying country, as well as of the world, is far from done. Until self-determination and economic sovereignty are established in Iraq, we must keep our efforts strong.</span></p> <p><span><i>Nicole A.

I\u2019d like to respond to the letter by Lecturer on the Study of Religion Brian C.W. Palmer \u201986 (<a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=357864\">\u201cKavulla Might Learn From Class He Criticizes,\u201d March 1</a>). Putting aside the misrepresentation of facts by Travis R. Kavulla \u201906in his column (<a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=357707%22\">\u201cBrian Palmer\u2019s Academy,\u201d Feb. 24</a>)\u2014the overlapping of courses, grading policies, degree of rigor of the class\u2014I have to say that at the core of his column lay a criticism of the class that I would have to agree with: the course lacks a sense of intellectual vigor in that it lacks a true diversity of thought. Yes, I heard many speakers, all of whom presented different perspectives on different issues. However, the course failed to challenge itself. The viewpoints that were presented\u2014often idealistic, always left-of-center\u2014were never questioned. To have heard a conservative viewpoint in Science Center B last spring would have been about as unexpected as hearing President Bush say he\u2019d love to endorse gay marriage.</span></p> <p><span>I agree that it is important to provide students with examples of successful individual actors who have championed socially conscious causes, but I also feel that it is important to illustrate that often compromises have to be made, and always, such efforts must take place in constant dialogue with more conservative voices. The atmosphere of the class was not conducive to productive debate or discussions of weighty content; rather, it seemed to me, and certainly to my more conservative roommate and fellow student of 1528, as a semester-long serenade to the choir. This is not to say that I did not enjoy the class or that I feel like I walked away at the end of last semester not having gained anything by taking the class.  I do mean to convey, however, that the class could have done much more. Handing over the floor to a few true, thoughtful conservative voices during the semester would have made the class infinitely more stimulating and engaging. If Palmer had, we might have actually had something to debate about in my section.</span></p> <p><span>I feel like Palmer\u2019s response to Kavulla represented exactly what was wrong with the course\u2014it answered narrowly those aspects of his editorial that were easily attacked and refuted and skirted the real issue of a lack of intellectual rigor in Palmer\u2019s class. There is no denying that Palmer\u2019s conception of diversity of thought is radically different than that presented by Kavulla in his column and I personally feel like Palmer\u2019s claim that Religion 1528 and Religion 1529, \u201cPersonal Choice and Global Transformation,\u201d are intellectually diverse is misguided.  I\u2019ll end with one word of caution\u2014Palmer shouldn\u2019t fall into the trap of the radcons and the ultra-conservatives who group everyone on \u201cthe left\u201d together and wholly dismiss them. From the content of Palmer\u2019s class and the nature of Palmer\u2019s response to Kavulla\u2019s challenge, it seems he might be on his way.</span></p> <p><span>Teddy E.

{"title": "Mourning in Spain | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The citizens of Madrid poured into the streets to grieve on Friday. In the aftermath of last week\u2019s calamitous bombing of a train in Madrid, an estimated 12 million people throughout Spain came together to cry out against the violence of terrorism. Thursday\u2019s attacks were a grievous horror; 200 killed, 1,400 wounded. Slaughter of this magnitude causes emotion of inexpressible depth\u2014made all the more upsetting because only now have investigators learned who was responsible and what their motive was. What happened in Madrid was so atrocious as to seem inhuman, and yet the world is faced with the difficult realization that such disastrous destruction could be, and indeed was, man-made.</span></p> <p><span>The heartwarming, global response to the terrorist attacks in Madrid is reminiscent of the worldwide outpouring of sympathy in the weeks following Sept. 11, 2001. Since then, the controversy over American engagement in Iraq has stimulated deep divisions in the international community. For too long, these divisions have overshadowed the broader tasks at hand and the reality that all nations remain vulnerable. Devastating terrorist attacks have occurred not only on American soil, but also in Bali, in Istanbul and now in Spain as well. The great question of how to stop global terrorism is still unanswered.</span></p> <p><span>The revelation yesterday that al Qaeda was likely responsible for the attacks\u2014instead of militant Basque separatists as initially reported\u2014brought little clarity, just more confusion to a world already bewildered and tense. Top American officials yesterday insisted that the latest attacks would not shake Europe\u2019s resolve. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said on television that the Madrid attacks mean anti-terror efforts ought to intensify, not diminish: \u201cThere is a war on terror that must be fought. Nobody\u2019s immune.\u201d Still, many protestors have blamed the attack on the government\u2019s support of the Iraq occupation, and yesterday\u2019s surprising election results ousting the ruling Popular party from power signals more changes are potentially in store.</span></p> <p><span>This discussion is healthy. If a war on terror must be fought\u2014how it ought to be fought remains to be fully understood. President Bush said in January that the invasion of Iraq had made the world a safer place; Thursday\u2019s bombing, if nothing else, should generate pause. Much work lies ahead.</span></p> <p><span>Families in Madrid have begun the task of mourning the loss of their loved ones in Thursday\u2019s senseless violence. We are reminded that each of the victims was somebody\u2019s mother, father, spouse or child; in the words of one Spanish banner, \u201cwe were all on that train.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>We stand in solidarity with the millions who turned out in Spain to protest terrorism on Friday. With arms outstretched and palms facing upwards, they declared in no uncertain terms that the violence must stop. In the midst of our grief for what happened, our most sincere hope extends out to the prospect that this violence will end. We are with the people of Madrid in these hours, as they bury their dead and grieve. And we look ahead at the difficult struggle that remains.</span></p>"}
{"title": "John Kerry Vs. Our Allies | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>In a debate last month for the Democratic candidates in Wisconsin, Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., was asked whether he felt any responsibility for the situation in Iraq after his vote authorizing President Bush to go to war. Kerry\u2019s reply included a telling phrase: he said he and Congress had voted \u201cto build a legitimate international coalition.\u201d Kerry\u2019s line prompted conservative pundit Andrew Sullivan to ask in The New Republic magazine, \u201cWas the Clinton Kosovo war the product of an \u2018illegitimate coalition\u2019? Is Kerry now saying that only U.N.-sponsored coalitions are henceforth kosher? What signal does this send to those many countries who did join the coalition?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Kerry\u2019s remark at this forum was not the first time he has dismissed the contributions of the nations that joined the United States in toppling Saddam Hussein and reconstructing Iraq. In fact, Kerry\u2014who is touted by his supporters as a man who would form lasting bonds with the rest of the globe\u2014has demonstrated a consistent pattern of alienating and misunderstanding the role of our allies. In comments published in the Des Moines Register on March 9, 2003, Kerry declared, \u201cThe greatest position of strength is by exercising the best judgment in the pursuit of diplomacy, not in some trumped-up, so-called coalition of the bribed, the coerced, the bought and extorted, but in a genuine coalition.\u201d Just in case there was doubt that Kerry had changed his mind since the end of the Iraq war, he repeated the charge in a December 2003 interview with Rolling Stone: \u201cThe president made a series of promises to us\u2014number one, that he was gonna make every effort to possible to build a legitimate coalition. He did not\u2014he built a fraudulent coalition.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Kerry\u2019s repeated statements on the issue of allies raise critical questions. What exactly constitutes a \u201clegitimate coalition?\u201d Kerry supported the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) campaign against Serbia under Milosevic in 1999, in which the U.S. acted without the support of the United Nations Security Council. So we hope it is safe to assume that the senator does not believe that a legitimate coalition always requires a U.N. mandate.</span></p> <p><span>The next question is how a President Kerry intends to win more support for American foreign policy abroad by insulting those governments that have stood by us thus far. There are now 10,000 troops, representing several European allies, under Polish command in southern Iraq. The Poles, for their part, have not been able to obtain the same privileged visa-free status that French and German travelers now hold to enter the U.S. This remains State Department policy in spite of the fact that France and Germany, unlike Poland, are known to have terrorist cells operating on their soil. Polish companies have found lucrative reconstruction contracts scarce in the new Iraq.</span></p> <p><span>The senator\u2019s charge of a \u201ccoalition of the bribed\u201d hardly fits the facts, then. But such charges are heard loud and clear by the opposition in Warsaw. Indeed, they ask reasonably, why should they stick their necks out for Uncle Sam when there is so little quid pro quo, and the opposition party in America accuses them of being stooges? All of this comes on the heels of strains in Poland\u2019s relations with its new partners in the European Union and sneering comments in major German publications last year referring to Poland as \u201cAmerica\u2019s Trojan donkey.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Then there is the small matter of what could happen in the future if a President Kerry decided that military action had become unavoidable, and sought the support of the European Union. Kerry\u2019s \u201ccoalition of the bribed\u201d logic has sent a none-too-subtle message that Warsaw and Rome should have deferred to their betters in Paris and Berlin in 2002 and 2003 and that is hardly going to win back support from the two largest nations at the heart of the E.U. in the future; in fact, it is more likely to earn their contempt. If France and Germany were to refuse to join the U.S. again and the rest of the continent remembered his rhetoric during the campaign, Kerry\u2019s administration could find itself without friends among Spain, Italy and Poland, Europe\u2019s medium-sized powers.</span></p> <p><span>Those nations would correctly perceive that Kerry sacrificed the principle of \u201cpresidents, prime ministers come and go\u201d in favor of pandering to a small part of the American electorate, while being challenged by former Vermont Gov. Howard B. Dean. Within Germany, this principle was invoked by opponents of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder in 2002, after he built his campaign around opposition to the war. Now it is Schroeder\u2019s government which may be on its way out, and the opposition Christian Democrats who urged a quiet, behind-the-scenes dissent towards Washington may yet reap the benefits. Kerry\u2019s calculus thus makes little sense even from the standpoint of mending fences with Paris and Berlin. The Bush Administration has sent American troops to operate alongside their French counterparts to restore order in Haiti and hosted Schroeder to discuss the possibility of Germany leading the NATO peacekeeping effort in Afghanistan. France also has quietly, according to the U.S. Central Command\u2019s website, contributed troops and airlifters to ongoing NATO operations in Central Asia.</span></p> <p><span>Kerry\u2019s defenders may cry foul, pointing to the alleged vilification of France by the Bush Administration in the run-up to war in Iraq as a justification for Kerry\u2019s disrespectful attitude towards the nations that took part in the coalition. While this \u201ceye for an eye\u201d argument might satisfy partisans, it does nothing to address the question of whether the nation will in fact have a less ideological foreign policy, as Kerry argues is his goal. Politics of course has never stopped at the water\u2019s edge, and vigorous and even fierce debate is historically the American way of foreign policy-making. But if there is to be hope for moving on to a new bipartisan foreign policy, the debate must not be poisoned by insults directed against both the governments that supported the Bush Administration in Iraq and those who did not.</span></p> <p><span><i>Charles D.

{"title": "Mo' Hegemoney, Mo' Problems | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>While Americans don their green today, the Bush administration is engaging in its favorite St. Patrick\u2019s Day tradition: incurring the ire of the Arab lands. Last March it was the invasion of Iraq \u2013 not altogether well-received in the Arab world. This year the administration has created a fresh furor in the region with its \u201cGreater Middle East Initiative\u201d (GME): a plan to bring democracy and enterprise to every country from Morocco to Afghanistan. Or as a headline in the pan-Arab daily Al-Hayat glowingly described it, a \u201cU.S. Working Paper for G8 Sherpas\u201d.</span></p> <p><span>Yes, the GME initiative has instantly garnered the \u201cimperialist\u201d label. Egypt\u2019s President Mubarak immediately condemned the American plan, declaring \u201cAll peoples by their nature reject whoever tries to impose ideas on them.\u201d One Al-Hayat writer put it even more bluntly, denouncing \u201cthe imperial tendency\u201d of \u201cspreading democracy in the Middle East as a way to take over the region.\u201d Nor has the backlash been limited to the Arab world. Our European allies\u2014shockingly\u2014have been cool to the plan as well, with one EU diplomat predicting it would precipitate a \u201cclash of civilizations.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Ballyhoo aside, a distinction needs to be drawn between imperialism and modernization, too often conflated in the West and elsewhere. Ireland herself provides an instructive example. In the 1600s Oliver Cromwell subjugated the Emerald Isle, massacring thousands of Irish civilians and confiscating most of their landholdings. In the ensuing centuries, the Irish people were subjected to harshly discriminatory anti-Catholic laws. That was imperialism. In the past few decades, the European Union\u2019s development grants to Ireland have helped transform the nation into a prosperous, open economy with a highly-educated workforce and an impressive growth rate. That is modernization.</span></p> <p><span>And there can be little doubt the Arab world is in need of modernization. As the UN\u2019s 2002 Arab Human Development Report (AHDR) notes, the region is plagued by high unemployment, low growth, pervasive illiteracy and a dearth of opportunity for women. The GME initiative challenges the G8 countries to fund programs that would address these gaps.</span></p> <p><span>The problem is, many in the US and other Western countries are wary of such modernizing projects, fearing that political and economic reforms amount to \u201cWesternization,\u201d to imposing our culture on others. Granted, democracy and sustained economic growth did arrive earlier in North America and Western Europe than in other parts of the world. But Western societies have also adopted innovations that originated elsewhere, including from the Middle East\u2014everything from Algebra to agriculture. Few would claim that the spread of farming and the quadratic equation represents \u201cMesopotamiazation.\u201d Why should democracy and mass literacy be any less universally applicable?  Indeed, the 2003 AHDR found that Arabs are more likely to agree with the statement \u201cdemocracy is better than any other form of government\u201d than anyone else in the world.</span></p> <p><span>Nonetheless, is it wise to impose modernization from outside? Surely not, but the plan can hardly be accused of imposing anything. Rather, the G8 programs would provide funds and technical assistance to Arab men and women working to create change internally: everything from journalism scholarships to micro-enterprise loans; from election monitors, to grants to pro-democracy NGOs and academic centers for women.</span></p> <p><span>The plan\u2019s Achilles heal is, as one Arab diplomat put it, \u201cthe messenger.\u201d Between Bush\u2019s over-zealous pursuit of illusory weapons in Iraq, and his under-zealous pursuit of a peaceful settlement in Israel, any plan he proposes for the Middle East is bound to be regarded suspiciously. The damage to our reputation wrought by the Iraq war will be hard to fix, but the president must make a credible effort to get Sharon and the Palestinian Authority back to the negotiating table. Until he does, the GME initiative will not go far.</span></p> <p><span>But in itself, the GME plan embodies the very strategy that Bush\u2019s critics (with whom I am proud to associate) have been calling on the president to adopt all along. State Department officials have been discussing the plan with ministers from Jordan, Egypt, Morocco and Bahrain and the plan will be presented at the G8 summit in June for discussion with Canada, Britain, Russia, Japan\u2014even France and Germany! The administration must be held accountable to ensure that consultation is genuine, but so far the prospects for multilateralism look good. And it should warm peace-loving hearts to see the administration promoting democracy by creating opportunities for Arab reformers, instead of mounting invasions.</span></p> <p><span>I am certainly not one to pass up an opportunity to disparage the Dissembler-in-Chief. But there are, after all, so many of those opportunities already. This time, the accusations of hegemonic designs just sound silly.</span></p> <p><span><i>Eoghan W.

{"title": "Conan the President | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>While the nation is focused on the 2004 election, my sights are no longer on the here and now. In the wake of Feb. 22\u2019s Meet the Press, I\u2019m all about 2008. The big news from Russert-world that day was Ralph Nader\u2019s decision to run as an independent. Nader\u2019s announcement got the headlines but the more important news came from the other guest, Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Governor of California. Asked about an Orrin Hatch-backed constitutional amendment that would allow foreign-born, U.S. citizens who\u2019ve lived here for more than 20 years to run for president, Schwarzenegger responded with enthusiastic support.</span></p> <p><span>But, when asked about the possibility of a run for the White House sometime down the road, the Governator responded by stating: \u201cI have no idea.\u00a0I\u2019ll tell you that I\u2019m so busy with our state.\u201d This is, of course, the standard non-denial denial that is the mark of every Presidential candidate in-waiting. While some may be tempted to ridicule Arnold\u2019s ambition or laugh at it as some stupid joke on a slow-news Sunday, if the amendment passes and Arnold runs, I\u2019d support him. Heck, he just might win.</span></p> <p><span>Arnold has a great issue profile. He is fiscally conservative, strong on defense, yet socially liberal. He\u2019s a Republican not beholden to the religious right. Literally and figuratively, he\u2019s the type of Republican even a Kennedy-liberal could love. He\u2019s the governor of a large state with complicated problems similar to those at the national level. Those dismissing him because of a perceived lack of experience should consider that in \u201908, Schwarzenegger will have been governor of California for five years. President Bush was only governor of Texas for six before being elected\u2014and former Democratic Presidential hopeful John Edwards is only a one-term Senator.</span></p> <p><span>Schwarzenegger is an ideal candidate. He\u2019s got widespread name recognition, a wife well-schooled in public relations, a considerable personal fortune to help finance his campaign and for those ladies swayed by John Edwards\u2019 sex appeal, the tanned and chiseled Arnold\u2014a seven-time Mr. Universe\u2014would surely be attractive. As President Bush scrambles to woo Hispanic voters, the nation\u2019s fastest growing demographic, Republicans should recall that despite running against a Latino candidate. Schwarzenegger managed to capture nearly a third of the Hispanic vote.</span></p> <p><span>And let\u2019s not forget what happened last time when Republicans put a little faith in an actor-turned-California-politician. They were richly rewarded with the White House for three consecutive terms. So to those Republicans waiting on the sidelines this primary season, join me in thinking ahead to \u201908. If you\u2019re smart, you\u2019ll ignore Condi, disregard Jeb, leave Frist in the Senate and go with Arnold for America.</span></p> <p><span>Of course, this is all wishful thinking. The Hatch Amendment most likely isn\u2019t going anywhere; and there are probably too many skeletons in Arnold\u2019s awfully big closet for him to mount any serious effort for the White House anyway. Arnold, however, shouldn\u2019t be ignored.</span></p> <p><span>Even more so than George W. Bush, he is amply prepared to revolutionize the GOP, while many Republicans are still seeking to turn back the clock. In the long arc of the American political tradition, Arnold\u2019s social liberalism is destined to prevail. He has already abandoned all opposition to abortion, homosexual \u201cmarriage\u201d and gun control. A few years from now, it\u2019s quite possible that the governor will be universally admired for his courage and foresight. To have any chance of winning future elections, Republicans must appeal beyond their evangelical base\u2014they must learn to love and emulate the Terminator.</span></p> <p><span><i>Adam J.

Huntington have called him a fascist, skewered him as a war criminal and bombed his Harvard office.</span></p> <p><span>Now, with Harvard students and faculty accusing him of xenophobia, Huntington, who is Weatherhead University professor, remains unfazed.</span></p> <p><span>In the March edition of the magazine Foreign Policy, Huntington\u2014who is also chairman of the Harvard Academy of International and Area Studies\u2014warns that a tide of Mexican immigration to the U.S. is undermining \u201cour Anglo-Protestant culture.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cUnlike past immigrant groups, Mexicans and other Latinos have not assimilated into mainstream U.S. culture, forming instead their own political and linguistic enclaves...and rejecting the Anglo-Protestant values that built the American dream,\u201d Huntington writes.</span></p> <p><span>Huntington\u2019s latest book, <i>Who Are We</i>, is slated to be published in May, but the excerpts printed by Foreign Policy have already sparked a flurry of criticism on campus.</span></p> <p><span>Leyla R. Bravo \u201905, president of Fuerza Latina, says her group is \u201coutraged\u201d by Huntington\u2019s article.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe is discrediting an entire ethnicity as problematic to the U.S.,\u201d she says. \u201cHe is creating a culture of intolerance.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Rudenstine Professor of the Study of Latin America David L. Carrasco wrote in an e-mail to The Crimson that he \u201cprefers to wait until the full text is available before passing a full judgement, but if these excerpts are representative, the book appears to present a mediocre study, at best.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Professor of Education and Social Policy Gary A. Orfield calls Huntington\u2019s essay \u201ca disgraceful example of the kind of anti-immigrant attitudes that appear recurrently in American history.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But Huntington dismisses the attacks.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf you want to get into slander, you can get into slander,\u201d Huntington says. \u201cObviously there is nothing racist about it.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><b>TOMATO SOUP FOR THE SOUL</b></span></p> <p><span>Who Are We, according to Huntington, \u201cis not a policy-oriented book,\u201d but rather a work aiming to spark \u201cnational discussion and debate\u201d over immigration.</span></p> <p><span>He says that America\u2019s ideals of liberty are deeply rooted in the country\u2019s cultural heritage.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWould America be the country that it had been and that it pretty much still is today if in the 17th and 18th centuries it had been settled not by British Protestants but by French, Spanish and Portuguese Catholics? The answer is, no, it wouldn\u2019t. It would be Quebec, Mexico or Brazil,\u201d Huntington says.</span></p> <p><span>He says the cultural transformation spurred by an influx of Mexicans \u201cwouldn\u2019t be the end of the world for America as a society, but it would be the end of American society as it has been.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Huntington proposes a revision to the \u201cmelting pot\u201d metaphor that has long been used to describe the assimilation of immigrant communities.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s more useful to think in terms of tomato soup. The base of the tomato soup is the aboriginal Anglo-Protestant culture,\u201d Huntington says.</span></p> <p><span>He says the influx of immigrants is \u201clike adding onions and croutons and parsley and spices to tomato soup, all of which make it much richer and more interesting.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><b>\u2018JOSE, CAN YOU SEE?\u2019</b></span></p> <p><span>Huntington says Mexican immigrants have staked a territorial claim to the American Southwest\u2014which Mexico controlled prior to 1848\u2014in what he characterizes as a \u201creconquista,\u201d or re-conquest.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThey view it\u2014legitimately\u2014as their turf, in some sense,\u201d Huntington says.</span></p> <p><span>In the most controversial portion of his article, Huntington\u2014citing observations of Texas entrepreneur Lionel Sosa\u2014highlights what he says are debilitating traits prevalent among Hispanic immigrants: \u201cmistrust of people outside the family, lack of initiative, self-reliance, and ambition; little use of education; and acceptance of poverty as a virtue necessary for entrance into heaven.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In the Foreign Policy article\u2014headlined \u201cJose, Can You See?\u201d\u2014Huntington casts doubt on the notion that Mexicans will follow the path of upward mobility traced by earlier immigrant groups.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere is no Americano dream,\u201d Huntington writes. \u201cThere is only the American dream created by an Anglo-Protestant society. Mexican-Americans will share in that dream and in that society only if they dream in English.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But scholars vigorously dispute Huntington\u2019s argument that the American dream is inextricably linked to Anglo-Protestant ethics.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere\u2019s a difference between Anglo-Protestant principles and the American dream,\u201d says Kresge Professor of Marketing Rohit Deshpande. \u201cLatinos have made it in America, and they\u2019ve done it their own way...You can speak Spanish at home and watch novelas on Univision, and be in fluent in English and very successful at work.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt is true that our country was founded and dominated by white Anglo-Saxon Protestants, many of whom were literate, democratically inclined on good days, and adept at making money,\u201d Gutman Professor of Latin American Affairs John H. Coatsworth wrote in an e-mail to The Crimson.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cBut many of their customs and beliefs were truly horrifying\u2014witch burning, slavery and segregation, killing off Native Americans and stealing their lands. They had no clothes sense, couldn\u2019t dance to save\u2014or lose\u2014their souls, and never ate garlic,\u201d Coatsworth says.</span></p> <p><span><b>CLASH OF GENERATIONS</b></span></p> <p><span>Huntington says his book \u201cbenefitted immensely from the comments and criticisms\u201d of students in his fall course Government 1582, \u201cWho Are We? Issues of American National Identity.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In the class, Huntington engaged his students in a \u201chealthy and contentious discussion\u201d on immigration, says Angela A. Amos \u201905, a social studies concentrator in Cabot House who took Government 1582 last semester.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHis speech often indicated a lack of political correctness, but I usually attributed that to his age,\u201d Amos says. \u201cWhen he phrased things forcefully, he encouraged people to speak up.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But Maribel Hernandez \u201904, a social studies concentrator in Winthrop House, says she was \u201creally upset\u201d by Huntington\u2019s rhetoric in the course.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to sit there in a class when you\u2014not personally but you as a Hispanic\u2014are being attacked,\u201d Hernandez says.</span></p> <p><span>Hernandez, who immigrated from Mexico at age 13, says she and three other Hispanic students in the class met with Huntington at the Faculty Club in December to discuss their concerns. \u201cWe never felt that he was receptive,\u201d she says. \u201cAt this point, he has his views, and he\u2019s not going to change them. It seemed like you were talking to the wall.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But Malkin Professor of Public Policy Robert D. Putnam offers a starkly contrasting portrait of his longtime colleague.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cSam is a man of strong, well-articulated and firmly-defended views...I have never had occasion to doubt his intellectual integrity and open-mindedness,\u201d Putnam says.</span></p> <p><span><b>A TRUSTED ADVISER</b></span></p> <p><span>Huntington has been no stranger to controversy in his four decades at Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>After traveling to Vietnam in 1967 as an adviser to the Johnson administration, \u201cI came back and wrote a report that was one of the more devastating critiques of what we were doing at that point,\u201d Huntington says.</span></p> <p><span>But Huntington\u2019s association with the war effort provoked the ire of more than a few activists.</span></p> <p><span>In 1967, The Crimson printed an advertisement accusing Huntington of genocide.</span></p> <p><span>Three years later, the Weather Underground, a militant group opposed to American involvement in Vietnam, bombed the Harvard Center for International Affairs, where Huntington still works.</span></p> <p><span>Huntington initially garnered national attention in 1957, when his first book, <i>The Soldier and the State</i>, was branded by reviewers as a fascist diatribe. \u201cThe leading professor in the Harvard government department at the time, Carl Friedrich, was a refugee from the Nazis. And he very mistakenly thought I was making an argument for authoritarianism, which wasn\u2019t true at all,\u201d Huntington says.</span></p> <p><span>Friedrich quashed Huntington\u2019s prospects at tenure, prompting Huntington to return to New York City, where he was born in 1927, and teach at Columbia University.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAnd then Harvard saw the error of its ways in 1962 and asked me to come back,\u201d Huntington says.</span></p> <p><span>In 1968, Huntington served as a top foreign policy adviser to Vice President Hubert Humphrey, who was then vying with Richard Nixon for the White House. That summer, he and longtime pal Henry A. Kissinger \u201950 vacationed in Martha\u2019s Vineyard. Kissinger\u2014who had worked for Nelson Rockefeller in the New York governor\u2019s primary bid against Nixon\u2014casually offered to leak Huntington Rockefeller\u2019s secret files on Nixon, Huntington says.</span></p> <p><span>He adds that Kissinger soon retracted the offer and signed on as an aide to Nixon, who won the election.</span></p> <p><span>A decade later, Huntington joined the Carter administration as a senior National Security Council official. But after serving on an advisory panel in the late years of the Reagan presidency, Huntington\u2014who says he supports Sen. John F. Kerry\u2019s 2004 candidacy\u2014acknowledges that his days in the political world are almost certainly over.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cKerry doesn\u2019t need me...He knows what the issues are. He\u2019s been much more deeply involved in foreign policy issues than I have. He ought to advise me on foreign policy,\u201d Huntington says.</span></p> <p><span>But even since he left the public sector, Huntington\u2019s analysis has dominated foreign policy discussions.</span></p> <p><span>In the summer of 1993, Huntington argued in the journal Foreign Affairs that \u201cthe fundamental source of conflict in this new [post-Cold War] world will not be primarily ideological or primarily economic. The great divisions among humankind and the dominating source of conflict will be cultural.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>This argument, crystallized in his 1996 book <i>Clash of Civilizations</i>, has drawn the attention of top Bush administration officials. Huntington says he shared his observations with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell over lunch in Washington last month.</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff writer Daniel J.

Glickman said that considering the website\u2019s recent launch, it is too early to see whether or not ClickBackAmerica.org would successfully encourage Progressive political activism on campus.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI don\u2019t think this is a very true indication of students\u2019 involvement in politics,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>But he added, \u201canything that\u2019s being done to get young people engaged, especially using the medium of the Internet, is a good thing.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In keeping with its motto\u2014\u201cYou Act, We Donate, Progressives Win!\u201d\u2014ClickBackAmerica.org contributes $1 to the MoveOn.org Voter Fund each time a student engages in a political campaign on the website.</span></p> <p><span>The MoveOn.org Voter Fund, according to its website, runs advertisements that are critical of the Bush administration, seeking to expose \u201cPresident Bush\u2019s failed policies in key \u2018battleground\u2019 states.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>This $1 million fundraising campaign\u2014sponsored by ClickBackAmerica.org and MoveOn.org Voter Fund\u2014is called the \u201cRace to a Million College Click Drive.\u201d This joint effort promises to award the highest-ranked school with public recognition from a yet-to-be-determined celebrity guest, according to Lloyd.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard College Democrats President Andy J. Frank \u201905 said that on-the-ground student participation is a better indication of Harvard\u2019s undergraduate political involvement than the ranking on the new website. For example, he said activities such as an anti-Bush rally planned for tomorrow and student involvement in presidential campaign efforts for Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., gave a better sense of Harvard\u2019s interest in the upcoming election.</span></p> <p><span>After visiting the website, Secretary of the Harvard Republican Club Lauren K.

Kennedy Jr. Forum at the Institute of Politics. The Forum featured the FRONTLINE documentary \u201cGhosts of Rwanda.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The forum started on a sober note with a clip from the documentary.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cLots of those eyes still haunt me,\u201d Dallaire said in the clip. \u201cHow come I failed? How come my mission failed? How come I lost my soldiers and 800,000 people died?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>During the event, Dallaire discussed his dealings with U.N. bureaucracy and his efforts to \u201cstymie the progress\u201d of the Rwandan genocide, in which 800,000 Tutsis were slaughtered by the Hutu government. The Hutus were the ethnic majority in Rwanda.</span></p> <p><span>Dallaire also discussed the ethical quandary he faced when negotiating with Hutu leaders responsible for the genocide.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI noticed some blood on them...and suddenly they were no longer humans,\u201d Dallaire said. \u201cI was literally talking with the devil.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIs it okay to negotiate with the devil to save people, or do I wipe them out right there?\u201d he continued.</span></p> <p><span>The other panelists\u2014\u201cGhosts of Rwanda\u201d producer Greg Barker and Kennedy School Lecturer and Pulitzer Prize Winner Samantha Power\u2014stressed institutional denial of the genocide and the reasons for the United Nations\u2019 failure to intervene. Carr Professor of Human Rights Practice and Director of the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy Michael Ignatieff moderated.</span></p> <p><span>The forum featured a seven-minute clip from \u201cGhosts of Rwanda\u201d in which journalists and Red Cross volunteers recounted how the Rwanda mission was \u201cdevoid of support from New York,\u201d where U.N. headquarters is located, and that \u201ceveryone knew what was going on in the country.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>After the clip, Power praised Dallaire for his leadership in adverse conditions.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe man who did the most feels the worst,\u201d Power said of Dallaire.</span></p> <p><span>She said lower-level U.N. bureaucrats had vital information concerning Rwanda, but that the highest level \u201chad other national interests.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cRwandans were just a cost-benefit equation...a statistic,\u201d Power said. \u201cTheir institutional interest was saving the U.N., even when saving the U.N. meant pulling troops out of Rwanda.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>All three panelists said the U.N. Security Council and U.S. government failed to intervene because they did not want to commit troops to a dangerous conflict in Africa.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe feeling was if you took sides, it was yours,\u201d Power said. \u201cYou were in it for the long haul.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Power also said President Clinton \u201cnever had a Cabinet meeting\u201d during the genocide. She added that Richard Clarke\u2014who was then a presidential adviser and who has recently alleged that the Bush administration bungled warnings of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks\u2014\u201cis the only one who\u2019s been honest. Clarke says [Rwanda] wasn\u2019t in our national interest...and if he had to, he would advise the same today.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Dallaire and Barker denied that Kofi Annan, the current U.N. secretary general who headed the U.N. Department of Peacekeeping Operations, got off too easily for his failure to act in the Rwandan crisis. Dallaire said Boutros Boutros-Ghali, secretary general at the time, deserved more blame than he received.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere was the kingpin. He wasn\u2019t even in New York the first three weeks of the genocide,\u201d Dallaire said.</span></p> <p><span>At the end of the forum, Ignatieff announced that Dallaire will be a fellow at the Carr Center next year. His concluding statement was that the audience should \u201cgo out tonight knowing [the genocide] did not have to happen.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Dallaire\u2019s accounts seem to have left an impression on audience members.</span></p> <p><span>Amy Smith, a student at Gordon College, said \u201cit was very provocative to hear from Dallaire himself\u201d and that she left with a greater understanding of the Rwandan genocide.</span></p> <p><span>Jessica Gustin, an Americorps volunteer who was also at the forum, added that seeing Dallaire was an \u201cextraordinary privilege.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>PBS will air \u201cGhosts of Rwanda\u201d on April 1.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Campaign Doggerel | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>So John F. Kerry is our bona fide Democratic candidate for the presidency. Or, should we say, bona fido? The media have taken a liking to describing the potential top dog and his pack in the most canine of terms, and their dogged use of canine imagery reduces politicians\u2019 personalities to the one-word descriptions that package them neatly for voters: They\u2019re sometimes trustworthy, sometimes loyal, sometimes frisky and sometimes vicious.</span></p> <p><span>First up is the vice-presidential vetting process. According to The Atlanta Journal and Constitution, \u201cKerry announced the appointment of prominent Washington Democrat James Johnson to start vetting potential vice presidential candidates.\u201d One of Kerry\u2019s advisors said in The New York Times: \u201cAs someone who has been through the vetting process, [Kerry is] familiar with it and wants a process that\u2019s good for the party and good for the campaign.\u201d The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) reveals this definition of \u201cvet\u201d: \u201cto examine carefully and critically for deficiencies or errors; specifically to investigate the suitability of (a person) for a post that requires loyalty and trustworthiness.\u201d The public is fed up with perfidy after all\u2014epitomized appropriately enough in a 1998 movie titled Wag the Dog\u2014and the media\u2019s talk of \u201cvetting\u201d reflects an interest in returning to values Americans want in their leaders. This is what vetting is all about: fitting candidates into their proper political boxes and figuring out which constituencies they woo best, be it the soccer moms or the NASCAR dads. Clearly vetting is not a very nuanced process\u2014for media characterizations it\u2019s the sound bytes that sell.</span></p> <p><span>Runner-up John Edwards is next up on the examination table. Not satisfied to retreat with his tail between his legs, he should take comfort in the words of Linda Feldmann of the Christian Science Monitor: \u201cHe\u2019s vetted; that\u2019s very important. Voters know what there is to know, both positive and negative, and they obviously like him.\u201d \u00a0I\u2019m somehow imagining Edwards with lights shone in his mouth, Saddam Hussein-style. Wary of electing house pets which are too docile for the voters\u2019 tastes, Helen Kennedy of The New York Daily News cautioned that \u201cEdwards has not been much of an attack dog, a key quality in a veep.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile the candidates are trying to avoid being \u201cdogged\u201d by issues that troubled their predecessors. To dog, according to the OED: \u201cto follow pertinaciously,\u201d \u201cpursue\u201d or \u201ctrack.\u201d The New York Times reports that a new round of Bush campaign ads aims to counter \u201ccharges by Democrats that Mr. Bush has lost touch with the people, a charge that had dogged his father in 1992.\u201d Kerry, on the other hand, has to be careful about how he presents himself with regard to gun laws\u2014\u201da lightning-rod cultural issue,\u201d says The Boston Globe, \u201cthat dogged Al Gore in 2000 and has the potential to swing certain voters in a general election, especially in rural areas and the South.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Set to spend the next eight months dogging each other, perhaps the most dogged man will persevere. Jill Lawrence in USA Today praised Kerry for \u201c[impressing] people with his dogged persistence, evident in his comebacks this year and in his 1996 Senate race.\u201d \u00a0Though Kerry\u2019s legislative record isn\u2019t so impressive, says Gail Chaddock of The Christian Science Monitor, \u201chis signature investigations were models of dogged, even relentless focus.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In all of the rough and tumble though, voters might forget that these candidates are far more complex than all the media\u2019s talk of vetting and dogging would suggest. Having overhyped the candidates\u2019 bark, it\u2019s time for media to start focusing on the issues, where the candidates can really bite.</span></p> <p><span><i>Liora R.

{"title": "The New Deal in Iraq | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>It has been a year since American troops poured across the Iraqi border, hurtling the world into a new era of international conflict. Where once there was multilateral action based on decades-old alliances, there is now the world\u2019s only superpower barely holding together a \u201ccoalition of the willing.\u201d Where once Western democracies would only launch strategic wars when attacked, there is now the leader of the free world defending preemptive war. And where once there was world-wide sympathy for the victims of Sept. 11, there is now the growing anti-American sentiment on the Arab street and beyond.</span></p> <p><span>It was this drastic redefinition of international norms, as well as thousands of American and Iraqi deaths over the last year, that spurred protesters over the weekend to fill city streets throughout the world. And, although we firmly disagree with the rhetoric of the far left of the protest movement\u2014clearly, the world is better off with Saddam Hussein safely behind bars\u2014we are glad those who opposed the war continue to fight the good fight. It is essential in this election year that dissenters continue pressing the Bush administration, as well as the American public, to honestly evaluate the many problems with President Bush\u2019s preventative war and its troublesome aftermath.</span></p> <p><span>We were against the kind of unilateral war Bush wanted to wage, and our suspicion that Bush would prove disastrous as a nation builder has largely been confirmed. In the year that has passed, we have learned a great deal about America\u2019s faulty intelligence regarding supposed weapons of mass destruction, corruption and cronyism in Iraq\u2019s rebuilding contracts and the extent of the Pentagon\u2019s miscalculations in its reconstruction plans. The world has good reason to be mad.</span></p> <p><span>But the international community must now focus on the future of Iraq because, although we opposed the war, America now has a real opportunity\u2014or rather, responsibility\u2014to improve the lives of the Iraqi people. And President Bush and his civilian administrator, J. Paul Bremer, are squandering that opportunity in the face of growing hostility from Iraqi civilians to Western administration of the country. The March 8 signing of an interim constitution makes Iraq on paper one of the most liberal states in the Middle East, granting a number of economic and social rights most Arabs can only dream of. But a legitimate, self-determined Iraqi government is still far off. Indeed, in a recent poll, only 11.3 percent of Iraqis had confidence in the Iraqi governing council, a ruling body comprised of hand-picked local leaders, dissidents and former expatriates.</span></p> <p><span>Yet, after prematurely declaring \u201cmission accomplished,\u201d Bush seems determined to proclaim democracy established as soon as possible\u2014before Iraq is adequately prepared for it. Mired in the paranoia of an election year, Bush has set a firm date for the transfer of power to local authorities\u2014June 30, well in time to disassociate his presidency from the volatile situation on the ground in Iraq. The president will be able to blame the mess\u2014the suicide bombings, random violence, rampant unemployment and poor social services that plague the country\u2014on the Iraqi administrators nominally in charge, rather than take responsibility for unimpressive reconstruction policy.</span></p> <p><span>But as politically convenient a June power transfer might be for the president, we hope that domestic political calculations will not keep him from doing what\u2019s right in Iraq. We fear that June 30 will be too soon for an effective handover of authority, given the chaos on the Iraqi street and the unpopularity of the Iraqi governing council\u2014some form of which remains likely to rule the country in the months following the power transfer. It will be difficult and unpopular, but if Iraq is not ready to govern itself by June 30, with functioning, legitimate democratic institutions, a nascent civil society and an effective police force (it\u2019s 0 for 3 right now), then America needs to continue controlling the reconstruction effort until the country is ready to strike out on its own.</span></p> <p><span>The mess in Iraq is not going to clean itself. Even in an election year, the president must ensure that the new democratic Iraq gets off on the right foot. Anything less, and the world will soon have another failed state mired in internal strife\u2014a breeding ground for the terrorists America is supposed to be fighting.</span></p>"}

John Edwards, D-N.C., bursts into Manny\u2019s Bar at halftime Sunday night, clearly a man on the prowl.</span></p> <p><span>It\u2019s Super Bowl Sunday in downtown Charleston. Edwards is making his first appearance here in weeks, and the campaign faithful are out in droves.</span></p> <p><span>High-ranking staffers mingle with the volunteers who make up the bulk of the campaign crew. Edwards signs line the walls, and Dean supporters are turned away at the front door.</span></p> <p><span>Cameras in hand, seven campaign volunteers stand along the edge of the crowd. These seven members of the Harvard College Democrats arrived in the heart of Edwards country last Thursday, political shock troops hoping to push their candidate over the top in the last days before the first-in-the-South primary.</span></p> <p><span>The Edwards supporters form part of a larger contingent of 22 College Dems who flew down to campaign for their favorite candidates, while gaining first-hand experience of the political process.</span></p> <p><span>With funding from the Institute of Politics (IOP), the College Dems lotteried 20 plane tickets for Charleston and its average January temperature of 51 degrees.</span></p> <p><span>At Manny\u2019s, the Edwards volunteers get the chance to meet the man they\u2019ve travelled hundreds of miles to help.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI can officially die now,\u201d laughs Brittani S. Head \u201906, president of Harvard Students For Edwards, after mugging with her candidate.</span></p> <p><span>The party continues at Manny\u2019s even after Edwards rolls on to the next stop on his \u201cReal Solutions Express.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Inside the bar, College Dems President Andrew J. Frank \u201905, chats up Ashley Bell, his national counterpart who is  president of the College Democrats of America. Bell notes that he has yet to meet a College Democrats chapter president who is not supporting Edwards. Frank, who volunteered  for Edwards in South Carolina, smiles; he\u2019s one of the gang.</span></p> <p><span>The relaxed mood of the Harvard volunteers belies their hard work over the past week. The College Dems have been knocking on doors, phoning voters and waving signs. They\u2019ve been shown on CNN, interviewed for the local news and featured on the front page of Charleston\u2019s major daily newspaper.</span></p> <p><span>The experience mixed exhilaration with frustration, fun and games with hard work.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere\u2019s a frantic energy,\u201d says Eric P. Lesser \u201907, a volunteer for the campaign of Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass. \u201cEveryone runs around and is so excited and nobody knows quite what to do.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><b>Spreading the Good Word</b></span></p> <p><span>Political canvassing is a quiet activity. Far away from the cheering crowds and deep-pocketed donors are hordes of volunteers walking the streets, knocking on doors and fueling the campaign from the ground level. These workers are a disparate bunch, an amalgam of college students, the unemployed and the elderly. It is a collective that can, on a warm January day in Charleston, build bonds between people who would not otherwise meet.</span></p> <p><span>All have made sacrifices to get here. Mumu Xu \u201907 shelled out $100 for airfare in addition to the cost of daily meals, all so that she could to give up her intersession break to work for Edwards. Matthew and Nathan Ray, two brothers who worked alongside the Harvard volunteers, drove down here from Ohio\u2014a 10 and a half hour drive. Each brother is taking time off from school. Nathan, 23, is in his last quarter at Ohio University in Athens, Ohio; Matthew, 15, is a high school freshman playing hooky for a few days.</span></p> <p><span>The streets they walk have names like Morning Dove Road and Summer Leaves Court. The neighborhood looks and feels like a recent development. The area of Canterbury Woods turns into the upscale Lake Myrtle Village, a block of pleasant suburban homes with manicured lawns and screened-in porches.</span></p> <p><span>Xu clutches a list of voters as she trudges door to door. Stepping up to the porch, she knocks gingerly, waits a few seconds, then knocks again.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI\u2019m from the Edwards For President Campaign, and I was wondering if we could count on your support on Tuesday,\u201d Xu says, in a prepossessing but shy voice.</span></p> <p><span>She is a bit nervous at first\u2014a bit too quick with her words. She may rush through her script, but in the end, the flyers are handed out, and the word has been spread.</span></p> <p><span>The majority of homes she stops by this Friday afternoon are empty. Xu drops a flyer in the door and checks off the house from her list. Those who actually make it to the door are pleasant, but don\u2019t say much. Maybe they\u2019re undecided, maybe they\u2019re already Edwards supporters; in the worst-case scenario, they\u2019re Republicans.</span></p> <p><span>After a full afternoon traipsing from one corner of the neighborhood to another, Xu is rundown by this tedious process.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty tiring,\u201d she admits.</span></p> <p><span><b>Young Blood</b></span></p> <p><span>Motivated college students make up the bulk of the campaign workforce here in South Carolina.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe relied heavily on volunteers, and a lot of those volunteers were college kids, with endless energy,\u201d says Cate Edwards, daughter of Sen. Edwards and a senior at Princeton. \u201c[They] don\u2019t need to sleep because they don\u2019t sleep anyway.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Many of the Harvard volunteers here have more experience than their peers in the campaigns, and they took charge early.</span></p> <p><span>Whether coordinating campaign events or after-hours drinking games, Brittani Head is one of the Edwards camp\u2019s most resourceful members.</span></p> <p><span>In the Charleston campaign office, she deals directly with the campaign directors. On the streets outside, she wields a video camera to capture the volunteers\u2019 interactions with voters for an IOP television program.</span></p> <p><span>Head\u2019s take-charge attitude is matched by Jessica R. Rosenfeld \u201907, who mans the front desk of the Edwards office just 24 hours after walking through the door for the first time.</span></p> <p><span>At the Dean campaign, Gina C. Schwartz \u201906, co-chair of Harvard Students For Dean, shouts into the receiver as her fellow Deaniacs call voters in the background. The elderly woman on the other line is hard of hearing.</span></p> <p><span>As Schwartz\u2019s voice rings through the house, David C. Marshall \u201907 forces himself out of his comfortable position and walks downstairs; he can\u2019t hear a word through the racket. Elizabeth S. Thrall \u201905 sits quietly at a desk, a cell phone cradled in her ear; Russell M. Anello \u201904 is upstairs making his calls.</span></p> <p><span>The Dean campaign office has moved two blocks south and two blocks west of its usual center of operations. These Dems, spending their off-peak weekend mobile minutes on phonebanking, can bring the cause with them wherever they go.</span></p> <p><span>A chorus of campaign spiels and \u201cyes, ma\u2019am, thank you ma\u2019am\u201ds fills the room. A Southern accent has started to creep into the volunteers\u2019 voices.</span></p> <p><span>Schwartz, a native of upstate New York, is suddenly blessed with a trace of South Carolinian drawl; Elizabeth has added a dash of Texan to her light New Joisey inflection.</span></p> <p><span><b>Shades of Frustration</b></span></p> <p><span>The Dean campaign here is full of passionate but inexperienced staffers and volunteers. There is a certain energy and verve that is missing from the mechanical quality of the Edwards operation. But at the same time, this energy is unfocused. Things are disorganized. Harvard volunteers grow impatient at being given overlapping canvassing routes and, worse, duplicate phonebanking numbers.</span></p> <p><span>At the Kerry camp, Harvard volunteers voice their frustration over the campaign staff\u2019s incompetence, and begin to take their own initiative.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s just frustrating that we spend so much time in the car,\u201d Lesser  complains after he and other Harvard volunteers spend nearly an hour trying to locate the right canvassing neighborhood.</span></p> <p><span>When the Kerry workers wind up in a wealthy, upper-class neighborhood, Jonathan D. Einkauf \u201906 worries that their efforts will be squandered in a \u201clikely\u201d Republican area. To prove his point, Einkauf accosts a man in his driveway, asking whether anyone in the neighborhood would ever vote liberal.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe gave me a look like I was smoking something,\u201d Einkauf says.</span></p> <p><span>Disappointed by the disorder of the campaign office, Einkauf, Lesser and Joseph M. Hanzich \u201906 take it upon themselves to leave literature at black churches and grocery stores along their assigned routes.</span></p> <p><span>Lesser explains that given the hectic circumstances, sometimes the volunteers on the ground have to take things into their own hands.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cA lot of the [campaign] strategies are written from Washington, D.C., or we were getting our orders from Columbia,\u201d Lesser says. \u201cBut once you put feet in the street you realize that certain things that they\u2019re asking you to do might not be effective.

In that case, which addressed the use of race as part of the criteria for admission at the University of Michigan Law School, the Court affirmed that \u201cuniversities occupy a special niche in our constitutional tradition\u201d and are entitled to extensive First Amendment freedoms.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cJudge Lifland got it wrong,\u201d Rosenkranz said. \u201cHe made one mistake that permeated the entire opinion: to treat nondiscrimination policies as conduct rather than as speech and thereby to take it out of the First Amendment rubric.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cNondiscrimination policies are speech at the core,\u201d Rosenkranz added. \u201cThey are about declaring and acting upon a position, just like a protest march. When a recruiter uses a campus forum to persuade people to join their cause, that\u2019s pure speech.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Feldblum said that by opening the door to military recruiters, schools are indeed making a clear, if unspoken, statement in support of the \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt is saying, \u2018Welcome in. We don\u2019t see anything wrong with you coming here and trying to get people to work for you. We agree with your recruiting principles, which include we only want you if you don\u2019t say you\u2019re gay,\u2019\u201d Feldblum said.</span></p> <p><span>If FAIR can convince the appellate court judges that allowing recruiters on campus is commensurate with speech, \u201cwe will have a much stronger constitutional claim,\u201d she said.</span></p> <p><span>Although the Third Circuit denied FAIR\u2019s motion for an expedited appeal, Rosenkranz said he was undeterred because the court is known for its \u201cvery fast docket.\u201d He said that litigants would likely appear before the three-judge panel for oral arguments in mid-March.</span></p> <p><span>The plaintiffs argued for immediate action against the Pentagon because \u201ceach day of this First Amendment violation is irreparable harm that outweighs the minimal impact on the military\u2019s effort to recruit lawyers,\u201d according to the brief filed Monday.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhen the government forces a law school to abet a discriminatory employer...it undermines the school\u2019s academic decisions, muddles the school\u2019s message, and compels the school to carry a message and support a cause against its will,\u201d the plaintiffs argue in the brief.</span></p> <p><span>HLS exempted the military from its nondiscrimination policy in 2002 after Pentagon officials threatened to block hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funds to the University.</span></p> <p><span>While University President Lawrence H. Summers called the Pentagon\u2019s policy \u201coffensive to human dignity\u201d in a Dec. 3 letter to the Harvard Gay and Lesbian Caucus, he has said on multiple occasions that Harvard will not join FAIR\u2019s coalition.</span></p> <p><span>Law students and professors from Yale and the University of Pennsylvania have filed their own suits. Students and professors at HLS have made moves towards initiating litigation but have not released a timetable for action.</span></p> <p><span>FAIR protects its member schools\u2019 anonymity to shield them from Pentagon retaliation, but New York University Law School and four others have publicly identified themselves as part of the coalition.</span></p> <p><span>FAIR is joined in its lawsuit by individual activists and the Society of American Law Teachers, an organization of over 800 professors.</span></p> <p><span>The suit lists Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld and five other Bush cabinet members as defendants.</span></p> <p><span>Pentagon officials did not return repeated requests for comment.</span></p> <p><span>FAIR\u2019s brief argues that the Solomon Amendment does not require schools to provide \u201caffirmative assistance,\u201d such as use of universities\u2019 recruiting resources, to military representatives.</span></p> <p><span>But according to FAIR\u2019s brief, \u201cthe military executed an about-face\u201d in December 2001, demanding inclusion in the schools\u2019 official recruiting functions.</span></p> <p><span>Regardless of the Third Circuit\u2019s ruling, litigants will likely appeal the decision to the Supreme Court, Feldblum said.</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff writer Andrew C.

Howard B. Dean led the field of Democratic presidential candidates for the 2004 election, garnering the support of 47 percent of Democratic-leaning Harvard students.

Smyth \u201905 said he wasn\u2019t concerned by the Crimson polling data.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe Harvard student body is in no way representative of Democrats in general; it is generally much more liberal,\u201d he wrote in an e-mail.</span></p> <p><span>Smyth, who is also a Crimson editor, said that for now, his group\u2019s primary concern lies in ensuring that Kerry culls strong support \u201cin primaries in New Hampshire and other early states.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Student coordinator of Harvard Students for Clark Anat Maytal \u201905 looked at the poll results favorably. Clark\u2019s showing demonstrates that though he entered the race late, he could net more support over time, Maytal wrote in an e-mail. Maytal is also a Crimson editor.</span></p> <p><span>And though Dean emerged as the preferred contender in the Crimson poll, Eli S. Rosenbaum \u201905, another coordinator of the Harvard Students for Clark campaign, said that he thinks Clark will prove to be a viable opponent.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMany thoughtful Democrats, especially on campus, are worried about supporting someone with more experience putting his foot in his mouth than conducting foreign policy,\u201d he wrote in an e-mail. \u201cStill, many who are angry at Bush have flocked to Dean like lemmings to a cliff. It\u2019s not intentional political suicide, just evidence of a very misguided sense of how to win a presidential election.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Rosenbaum also suggested that the mounting interest in Clark\u2019s campaign following his visit to the college reflects a wider national trend.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe more that people see and hear Clark, the more they like him,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>But co-chair of Harvard Students for Dean Andrew M.

{"title": "Environmental Inaction | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Burgeoning greenhouse gas emissions, generated by industry across the globe, are a serious threat to the environment. And while staunch legislative protection of the environment seems unlikely under the current Bush administration, shareholder pressure on corporations that contribute to the pollution can help encourage industrial producers to clean up their acts.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard, as a shareholder in many companies, frequently participates in proxy votes, which act as shareholder referenda on corporate policy. But recently, Harvard has failed to do its part in protecting the earth\u2019s future. Earlier this year, the Corporation Committee on Shareholder Responsibility (CCSR), a Harvard body that votes in the referenda of the companies in which Harvard owns stock, abstained from six proxy votes to commission reports on  curbing corporate greenhouse emissions.</span></p> <p><span>The CCSR makes the final decision on Harvard\u2019s vote but is advised by another Harvard group, the 12-member Advisory Committee on Shareholder Responsibility (ACSR)\u2014which has four student members, including one undergraduate. In five of its six proxy vote abstentions on global warming, the CCSR rejected the recommendations of the ACSR\u2014wasting Harvard\u2019s potential to send a forceful message about environmental responsibility.</span></p> <p><span>By contradicting the advice of the ACSR, the Corporation Committee has essentially ignored the carefully-researched affirmative-vote determination reached by the ACSR. The Advisory Committee devotes enormous amounts of time and attention to the issues on which Harvard will vote, and the CCSR members ought to give great weight to its judgment on these important environmental votes.</span></p> <p><span>In a proxy vote for Plum Creek Timber shareholders on whether to adopt a code of environmental conduct called the Ceres Principles\u2014a set of voluntary, environmentally-friendly guidelines, stressing accurate reporting as well as environmental protection\u2014the CCSR did not follow the Advisory Committee\u2019s recommendation and abstained. The Ceres Principles are a worthy code of conduct for corporations. Companies that follow the Principles must report annually on their environmental performance, information that is essential for policy makers to better maintain our global climate. Voting for one company to adopt the Ceres Principles is admittedly a small step, but it is one that the CCSR\u2014which, in a letter explaining a similar abstention last spring, told Plum Creek Timber that it agreed with the \u201cunderlying goals\u201d of the Principles\u2014should have taken. Harvard has an additional imperative to lead by example and should have stood by the Principles when it came time to vote.</span></p> <p><span>Opponents of the Ceres Principles may cite the additional cost of providing the information dictated by the code of conduct, which could potentially lead to smaller shareholder profits. Certainly there are benefits to maximizing the return on Harvard\u2019s endowment, but there need not be a stark choice between profitability and environmental consciousness. The KLD Domini 400, an index of socially responsible companies, has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 for 1-year, 3-year, 5-year and 10-year returns. Concern for the environment does not invite imminent financial collapse.</span></p> <p><span>While the CCSR\u2019s public explanation of its decision in the Plum Creek case last year was laudable\u2014and should be repeated for all of these recent abstentions\u2014the CCSR should  back up this stance with its voting record.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Dissent Mongers | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>In April of 2002, members of the environmental activist organization Greenpeace engaged in a routine demonstration. Two activists boarded a freighter off Miami that was believed to be carrying mahogany from a protected Brazilian forest, intending to unfurl a banner that read \u201cPresident Bush: Stop Illegal Logging.\u201d But before they could do so, they\u2014along with four other activists\u2014were detained, arrested and sentenced to time served. Case closed, right? Wrong.</span></p> <p><span>The Justice Department is now pressing criminal charges against Greenpeace for authorizing the protest. If found guilty, the group could lose its tax-exempt status.</span></p> <p><span>The case is drawing considerable attention, in part because it is nearly unprecedented for an organization to face criminal charges for the non-violent protest activities of its members. Greenpeace has suggested that the case might even be a first in this respect. Some legal experts disagree, however, citing a particularly proud chapter in our nation\u2019s history\u2014harassment of the NAACP by southern states during the 1950s and 60s.</span></p> <p><span>The case against Greenpeace is hardly clear-cut either. The attorney general is prosecuting the organization under an obscure 1872 law\u2014last enforced in 1890\u2014that was intended for \u201csailor-mongers,\u201d who lured ships\u2019 crews ashore to shady bars and brothels. But you can hardly blame him. How many good sailors must environmental activists lead astray before the attorney general takes a stand?</span></p> <p><span>What\u2019s going on here? The government normally doesn\u2019t dust off anachronistic old laws unless it\u2019s out to make a point, and this is no exception. It might be reassuring if the Greenpeace case were just a weird outlier. But it\u2019s not. It is emblematic of a concerted effort by the White House and its allies to curb unwelcome dissent.</span></p> <p><span>Consider the use of \u201cdesignated free speech zones\u201d (can you imagine a creepier, more Orwellian name?) to sanitize crowds during public appearances by top administration officials. Protestors carrying signs critical of the administration are herded into these \u201cdesignated free speech zones\u201d\u2014also called \u201cdesignated protest zones\u201d\u2014out of sight of the motorcade route or event; those demonstrating in support of the president are not. Protestors who refuse to move have been arrested, and a South Carolina man is currently facing federal charges. The ACLU is seeking a federal court injunction to force the Secret Service to discontinue this unconstitutional practice.</span></p> <p><span>Then there\u2019s the speech that Andrew S. Natsios, the head of the U.S. Agency for International Development, delivered at a conference of relief and development nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) last May. These groups were receiving government funding to pursue humanitarian efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq. But he reportedly reproached them for failing to make clear to the citizens of those nations that they are \u201can arm of the U.S. government.\u201d According to those present, he then \u201cthreatened to personally tear up their contracts and find new partners.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Natsios\u2019 comments are deeply troubling. Referring to the NGOs as merely \u201can arm\u201d of government demonstrates a profound misunderstanding of their mission and public value. True, the government ultimately has the right to choose who receives its contracts. But it is vital that NGOs be allowed to retain their independence. An unswerving commitment to their causes often demands that NGOs offer a critical perspective on government policy. But the Bush administration would rather co-opt these groups or, failing that, prosecute them a la Greenpeace.</span></p> <p><span>The Bush administration\u2019s hostility toward much of the NGO community\u2014and toward dissent more generally\u2014is reflected in a new initiative of the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) and the Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies entitled \u201cNGO Watch.\u201d The initiative is motivated by the rather overwrought concern that the \u201cextraordinary growth of advocacy NGOs...has the potential to undermine the sovereignty of constitutional democracies.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Now, I know what you\u2019re asking yourself: \u201cAren\u2019t AEI and the Federalist Society both NGOs themselves? Don\u2019t both of these conservative groups peddle a huge amount of influence in the current administration? Isn\u2019t this all just the slightest bit ironic?\u201d Yes, yes and yes. That\u2019s chutzpah for you. Unsurprisingly, the NGOs being \u201cwatched\u201d are mostly left-leaning consumer, environmental and social justice groups critical of the administration and possessed of pathetically little influence.</span></p> <p><span>But it\u2019s not just NGOs and individual protestors that are feeling the brunt of this current crack-down on dissent. The latest issue of The Nation includes a story that examines what journalists see as \u201cdeliberate decisions\u201d on the part of Pentagon officials to restrict their ability to cover some of the more politically sensitive aspects of the Iraqi engagement, such as the repatriation of the bodies of troops killed in Iraq. And remember the case of Valerie Plame, the CIA officer whose cover was recently blown? An ongoing investigation is still trying to determine whether a senior aide to President Bush disclosed Plame\u2019s identity to the columnist Robert Novak after her husband began voicing criticism of the Iraq invasion.</span></p> <p><span>The Bush administration is clearly determined to quash dissent; they\u2019ve made a pretty good go at it already. But at the rate they\u2019re heading it looks like they\u2019ll have their hands full for some time to come.</span></p> <p><span><i>Sasha Post \u201905 is a social studies concentrator in Adams House.

Now, I\u2019m a Russian studies concentrator, so maybe I just think that whole part of the world and its aging nuclear arsenal is more newsworthy than it actually is. But I was struck by how this story melted off American radar screens but a few days after the elections.</span></p> <p><span>Since he assumed the presidency of the Russian Federation in January 2000, Vladimir V. Putin has slowly but surely consolidated his power, all the while keeping his public approval ratings in the 70 percent range. After systematically banishing, locking up or otherwise neutralizing many of his most outspoken rivals\u2014and taking over their TV stations\u2014Putin has pulled Russia into what scholars now dub \u201cmanaged democracy.\u201d In this nice little arrangement, the Russian president and the party he supports submit to relatively free democratic elections, but use state control over procedure and the media to push for electoral success. Some of the dirty tricks they perpetrate would make Richard Nixon blush, such as forcing government employees to actively campaign for the president\u2019s favored party and limiting the opposition\u2019s access to television time.</span></p> <p><span>This time around, Putin\u2019s management worked like a charm. The pro-Kremlin party United Russia\u2014which has a vaguely nationalistic platform based around support for the president\u2014won the largest share of the vote of any electoral faction in the history of post-Soviet parliamentary politics, 37.5 percent. With the other solidly pro-Putin deputies added in, the ex-KGB officer has enough votes in Russia\u2019s lower house of parliament, the State Duma, to alter the Russian Constitution, a scary prospect in a country still shaking off centuries of despotic rule. Putin could use this constitutional majority to give himself a third term, or to extend his power to rule by decree, or to do whatever the hell he wanted with United Russia and the electorate now slavishly loyal to him.</span></p> <p><span>But such alarming news hardly made a splash in the United States. Sure, The New York Times ran its requisite coverage from the foreign desk and an editorial from out of nowhere praising the slow but steady progress of Russian democracy, but the talking heads simply brushed it aside, and the story became little more than a small blurb on Headline News. Instead of hearing about tainted elections, we heard about the Paris Hilton video. And while both are important in their own way, I\u2019m pretty sure most of us would agree that Putin is a little bit more important than porn.</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Stephen W.

Rubins \u201905 spent last Wednesday like the ten preceding 15-hour days, frantically researching in dull light on even drabber furniture.</span></p> <p><span>An hour\u2019s drive from the carrels of Lamont Library, Rubins is more than a few mindsets removed from reading period.</span></p> <p><span>The Social Studies concentrator drew a long pause before she could even name her four classes.</span></p> <p><span>Here in the Manchester campaign headquarters \u201cWar Room\u201d of Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, D-Conn., Rubins\u2019 manic energy blends in among the other two dozen staffers working to win \u201cJoe\u201d the Democratic nomination.</span></p> <p><span>Rubins began working for the Lieberman campaign last summer in Washington, D.C., and the campaign asked her to continue through the fall term.</span></p> <p><span>She attends debates in New England and transcribes Lieberman\u2019s speeches. She founded Students for Lieberman at Harvard and has now spent almost two weeks of her winter break and reading period in New Hampshire canvassing, phone-banking and researching Lieberman\u2019s gaggle of opponents.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI\u2019m involved in politics because I think it\u2019s the most noble thing,\u201d she said last Thursday, a few hours before returning to Cambridge. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to get caught up in the minute things. The next paper, the next exam. Going back to Boston will be a shock\u2014I go from working on a national presidential campaign to writing a lit paper.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The War Room is hardly comfortable, but Rubins is reluctant to leave it. The corner where she worked is dark and claustrophobic, filled with small televisions tuned to different news programs.</span></p> <p><span>Mismatched, dilapidated sofas decorate the office\u2014some even with holes in the arms\u2014amidst the cubicles of different sizes and colors, which round out the office. Tacky hand-made campaign posters adorn the walls: \u201c1600 Penn Ave or BUST!\u201d and \u201cHeinz may have ketchup but I relish Hadassah\u201d\u2014a reference to Heinz Co. heiress Theresa Heinz, the wide of Sen. John F. Kerry\u2019s ,  D-Mass.</span></p> <p><span>Rubins much prefers her current position with the campaign\u2014as political researcher and speech transcriber\u2014over the traditional campaign activities of canvassing and phone-banking.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cYou\u2019re just a body,\u201d says Rubins, adjusting the bandana covering her shoulder-length curly brown hair as she sits back in her chair. \u201cBut if they feel you can do something unique\u2014well, fast typing isn\u2019t really unique\u2014but if you can contribute something, you can distinguish yourself.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Working with the Lieberman campaign, she says, has shown her that politics is the right path.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI\u2019ve always said I want to go into politics,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd then I was like, if you want to do it, you better see what it\u2019s like first.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><b>From Minnesota to the Moon, and Beyond</b></span></p> <p><span>Politics is not the only thing on the agenda for Rubins.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to be an astronaut. And write a novel. The Great American Novel, of course. That\u2019s all.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But right now this Minnesota native manages to occupy herself with politics and plays.</span></p> <p><span>She is producing her fifth show next semester, Crazy for You, a musical based on George Gershwin songs. Last semester, she produced South Pacific.</span></p> <p><span>Rubins says that producing plays and working campaigns are very similar in some respects\u2014a group of dedicated people comes together for a period of time for a common goal and then disbands once that goal is accomplished.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe campaign has a special place because it\u2019s bigger than anything else I do,\u201d she said as she rushed back from New Hampshire to teach Hebrew School.  \u201cI can see what I do for the campaign having a real effect on the country. It\u2019s more worldly. But, on the other hand, I need to take advantage of every second at school. When will I get to produce a Broadway musical again?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Rubins is the only Harvard student volunteering at Lieberman\u2019s headquarters, and though other members of Students for Lieberman have come up to New Hampshire for one-day canvassing, she is the only student to have made a long-term commitment.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cA lot of people I\u2019ve talked to support him but don\u2019t want to make the trek,\u201d she says.</span></p> <p><span>Rubins admits that there isn\u2019t wide support for Lieberman on Harvard\u2019s campus outside of the Students for Lieberman group. She says that students are attracted to the \u201cglamour\u201d of the Dean and Clark campaigns.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf you don\u2019t think a lot about [the issues], these are the campaigns that students are drawn to. Clark and Dean seem to be more liberal than Joe,\u201d she says.</span></p> <p><span>Rubins thinks that the current challenge for Lieberman is to beat Clark to become the \u201canti-Dean.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cClark is his biggest competitor now, but ultimately it will be Dean,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that will be decided in the South where Joe is hugely popular.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Lieberman is currently polling at 9 percent in South Carolina.</span></p> <p><span><b>Campaign Lieberman: A Hope and a Prayer</b></span></p> <p><span>Rubins met Lieberman\u2014whom she calls \u201cJoe\u201d\u2014at  campaign headquarters in Washington, D.C. last summer. The first thing she asked him is where to find a good synagogue for Friday night services.</span></p> <p><span>Like Lieberman, Rubins is an Orthodox Jew.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI feel a closer connection to him because of [his religion], but it\u2019s not the reason I\u2019m supporting him,\u201d she says. \u201cI would support someone of a different religion with Joe\u2019s positions and thoughtfulness.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Lieberman frequently mentions God in his speeches and sometimes seems to be running on a platform of morality.</span></p> <p><span>Rubins doesn\u2019t have a problem with Lieberman\u2019s religious references.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhen he talks about God it\u2019s the same way the dollar bills do, and I admire that,\u201d she says.</span></p> <p><span>She understands Lieberman\u2019s desire to talk about his faith, but she doesn\u2019t think it wins votes.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf I was writing [Lieberman\u2019s] speeches I probably wouldn\u2019t mention God that much,\u201d she says. \u201cI think America is weary of the God talk, and though I know where it\u2019s coming from, it seems conservative.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Rubins observes the Sabbath, attending synagogue in Manchester for Friday night services, where she also talks with \u201cpotential voters.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Rubins says she will support Lieberman\u2014\u201cfighting the good fight\u201d\u2014as long as he is in the race, but she concedes she would ultimately work for the Democratic candidate, no matter who wins the nomination.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI\u2019d probably switch to another campaign, though I can\u2019t imagine working for another candidate right now, especially since I do research so I know what their positions are,\u201d she says.</span></p> <p><span>She wants to work in Washington again this summer but does not yet have concrete plans. One thing is for certain, she says: she will be working on her thesis at the Library of Congress.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI want to write a manifesto for American society,\u201d she says, bobbing her head seriously. \u201cOur country needs a vision, a mission.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>What is her vision? \u201cWell, foreign aid\u2026and bringing the world\u2019s standard of living up and\u2026space exploration! Like, what\u2019s happening with that? There\u2019s a future for the entire human race that we need to think about. There\u2019s more to America than everyone owning their own SUV in the suburbs and we need to find out what that is.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Career-wise, Rubins\u2019 long-term plans are to run for political office. She admires John F.

{"title": "What Would Radcliffe Rugby Do | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>This column was almost very boring. It being my last, I thought it would be appropriate to address the Democratic presidential candidates and politics on the national stage. So I dutifully wrote to Harvard Students for Dean to test the waters. As luck would have it, this columnist got Dean\u2019s first name wrong in her email, and subsequently got no responses from HSD, (or whatever their acronym is). But then I realized: I\u2019m not interested in writing about Dean. How he really likes to talk tough about Bush. How he\u2019s running a more grassroots campaign. How he ran a tight ship in Vermont. It\u2019s all great. It\u2019s what everyone\u2019s talking about. Let\u2019s talk about something else.</span></p> <p><span>What about a group of women who like to get up very early in the morning and wrestle around in the goose poop on Soldier\u2019s Field? What about a team who gets no Crimson press even when they kick Yale\u2019s butt every season? What about a club team whose financial budget is miniscule compared to their male counterparts? What about hookers, props, outside centers, and scrum-halfs? For this column, let Radcliffe Rugby be your McLaughlin Group, your All Things Considered, your James Carville (with hair). Let\u2019s find out what they think.</span></p> <p><span>If you\u2019re not convinced that Radcliffe Rugby merits the commentator\u2019s chair, consider this: they\u2019re smart enough to see through political B.S. and cynical enough about current affairs to want real change. They\u2019re politically committed, extracurricularly over-committed, and they can sing a mean rendition of \u201cDoe, a deer, a female deer,\u201d that, if included here, would ensure that Crimson President Amit R. Paley\u2019s mother never invites me to Seder again.</span></p> <p><span>So, the question I\u2019ve posed is, if they went to the polls tomorrow, \u201cWhat would Radcliffe Rugby do?\u201d I\u2019ve conducted an informal poll, and I got 20 responses out of a squad of around 35. It won\u2019t get me through Stat 100 (I don\u2019t know what did get me through Stat 100), but it will serve the purpose. We had a few outliers: one libertarian who plays wing, one self-described \u201cgay neo-con\u201d who plays second row, and one Canadian fly-half for Carol Moseley-Braun. Otherwise, those who responded will vote, and they\u2019ll vote left. The majority are Dean supporters. Several ruggers are pessimistic that anyone can beat Bush, but will vote anyway. Four others favor Kucinich, and, in a perfect world, would vote for him before Dean. One thinks that Clark might have the needed edge. But most are swayed by Dean\u2019s tough talk, and a couple even mentioned that Dean\u2019s candidacy has inspired them to care more about politics.</span></p> <p><span>But what\u2019s most interesting about the results of my \u201cpoll\u201d was that a majority of respondents expressed frustration with the general direction of mainstream politics. Eleven out of 20 Radcliffe players, though they see the election as important, still feel that a Democrat in the White House won\u2019t bring about change of the order that this country desperately needs. One scrum-half wrote that she will be \u201c100 percent satisfied if we can just get Bush out of the White House,\u201d but this was a minority opinion\u2014most who responded will be happy to see Bush go but won\u2019t be completely satisfied to see the baton passed to any of the other candidates. A forward prop seems to sum up the feelings of many others when she said, \u201cof course I recognize that the outcome [of the presidential election] matters gravely, but I also feel quite disempowered.\u201d Radcliffe Rugby will vote, but it\u2019s not because any of the candidates truly represent their views.</span></p> <p><span>Some would say that the more progressive concerns expressed by the rugby team should be quelled in order for us to shore up support for a candidate who can beat Bush. But I think that the team\u2019s words of warning about the perils of politics-as-usual couldn\u2019t come at a better time. In a moment when the center beckons to candidates (and of course this side-stepping may only get worse after the primaries), Radcliffe Rugby\u2019s opinions matter most. We could sit around all day and debate whether Dean\u2019s really liberal, or whether anyone actually likes Clark. But this will do little to change the fact that too many Americans are in prison, receive little pay and even less respect for the jobs they do, and are sending billions of tax dollars to a government that fosters corporate greed. Politicians can make a difference, one outside center said, if they \u201cdecide that oppressed people matter.\u201d But have any of the Democratic candidates made that decision? Radcliffe Rugby speaks, and we would do well to listen.</span></p> <p><span><i>Beccah G. Watson \u201904 is a history and literature concentrator in Adams House.

Now the chairman of Citigroup, he returned to the private sector and serves as a member of the Harvard Board of Overseers.</span></p> <p><span>Albright, who emigrated to America at age eight from the former Czechoslovakia, first served as the United States\u2019 ambassador to the United Nations before she became Secretary of State in 1997, making her the highest ranked female in the history of American government.</span></p> <p><span>Only a week before the Iowa Caucus, neither Albright nor Rubin chose to endorse any of the Democratic primary candidates, but instead detailed the failures of the current administration and the successes of their own.</span></p> <p><span>Rubin attacked Bush\u2019s economic policy, saying despite the present upswing, long term tax cuts would send the deficit soaring.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe are on the wrong track in every part of U.S. economic policy,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a high probability for a type of crisis we haven\u2019t seen in a long time.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Having orchestrated U.S. support to crisis economies such as Mexico, Thailand and Russia during his tenure, Rubin said that good fiscal policy depended on \u201ccalculated risks\u201d and \u201cfiscal responsibility,\u201d neither of which the current administration has demonstrated.</span></p> <p><span>Albright criticized Bush for acting unilaterally in Iraq.</span></p> <p><span>While citing herself as an \u201cactivist\u201d administrator, she said that in calculating any move the government must always play their diplomatic cards first.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf the U.S. doesn\u2019t do something things don\u2019t happen, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you do it alone,\u201d she said.</span></p> <p><span>Albright added that terrorism cannot be combated alone and since Bush has \u201csquandered our surplus of good will\u201d abroad, tracking terrorist networks and funds will become increasingly difficult.</span></p> <p><span>In addition to policy issues, both speakers ruminated on the fate of the Democratic Party and status of national leadership.</span></p> <p><span>In response to a question about the balance of power in Washington, Rubin commented that liberals cannot compete with the neo-conservative think tanks and the disciplined infrastructure of Washington conservatives.</span></p> <p><span>Albright further attacked Bush\u2019s Washington, calling it \u201ctoxic.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf you ask questions, you are accused of being unpatriotic,\u201d she said. \u201c[They have] lost their minds.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>She did, however, cite hope in Democratic voters who seemed to be mobilizing for this election, calling it a testament to the fact that individual citizens do and can hold their government accountable.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cOur charm is that we are undisciplined,\u201d she said.</span></p> <p><span>And while both former cabinet members detailed a variety of differences between their administrations and Washington today, they returned to one the most.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe worked for a president who told us what books to read and had read them,\u201d Albright said.</span></p> <p><span>Championing Clinton\u2019s scholarly instincts, she and Rubin agreed that a president must intellectually engage with issues in a way they said Bush has not.</span></p> <p><span>In an anecdote resonating with the Harvard Square audience, Rubin recalled a meeting between Clinton, himself and University President Lawrence H.

{"title": "Faculty File Brief Against Pentagon | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>A majority of the Harvard Law School (HLS) faculty submitted a friend-of-the-court brief to federal appellate judges yesterday arguing that Pentagon attorneys have misinterpreted the 1996 Solomon Amendment.</span></p> <p><span>The move by 54 law professors marks the sixth friend-of-the-court brief filed this week challenging military recruitment on college campuses, including one from the student gay rights group HLS Lambda.</span></p> <p><span>The Pentagon claims that under the 1996 statute, the secretary of defense can cut hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funds to universities that limit military recruiters\u2019 access to students.</span></p> <p><span>HLS professors are still considering initiating their own suit against the Pentagon, according to Bloomberg Professor of Law Martha L. Minow, who spearheaded the filing of yesterday\u2019s brief.</span></p> <p><span>The briefs support the Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights (FAIR), a network of 15 law schools, which has sued six Bush cabinet officials to halt enforcement of the amendment.</span></p> <p><span>A three-judge panel from the Third Circuit Court of Appeals is expected to rule on the FAIR suit in mid-March.</span></p> <p><span>HLS requires that recruiters who use the school\u2019s Office of Career Services (OCS) must pledge not to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation.</span></p> <p><span>The military\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy requires the discharge of openly gay service members, and the Pentagon has refused to sign the pledge.</span></p> <p><span>In May 2002, Pentagon officials threatened to block federal funding for all Harvard schools unless HLS provided the military access to OCS. Three months later, then-HLS Dean Robert C. Clark granted military recruiters an exemption from the nondiscrimination policy.</span></p> <p><span>But according to yesterday\u2019s brief, HLS had been in compliance with the Solomon Amendment even before Clark\u2019s 2002 move.</span></p> <p><span>The amendment \u201conly applies to anti-military policies that single out the military for special disfavorable treatment,\u201d the brief argues.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cOur old and long-standing policies with respect to military recruitment were perfectly legal,\u201d said HLS Dean Elena Kagan, who signed yesterday\u2019s brief in her capacity as a professor.</span></p> <p><span>According to Minow,  the brief also argues that even without using OCS resources, the Pentagon still succeeded in recruiting HLS students before the 2002 policy change.</span></p> <p><span>The amendment only authorizes the Pentagon to retaliate against schools that \u201cprohibit,\u201d or \u201cin effect prevent\u201d military recruitment. But the level of access HLS provided to military recruiters prior to the change more than satisfied the statute\u2019s requirements, Kagan said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cDeclaring that universities may not \u2018prohibit\u2019 or \u2018prevent\u2019 military recruitment is a far cry from saying that they must actively assist the military\u2019s efforts,\u201d the brief argues.</span></p> <p><span>HLS Professor of Law Janet Halley, an expert on military policy toward gays, said that the brief presented \u201can elegant legal theory.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But the professors\u2019 brief\u2014unlike the one filed by HLS students on Monday\u2014does not discuss FAIR\u2019s First Amendment claims.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe\u2019re not weighing in on the constitutional issues,\u201d Kagan said. \u201cWe\u2019re providing something new to the discussion...It\u2019s an extremely convincing and powerful argument.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cBy focusing attention on the overly-broad enforcement of the statute, [the brief] calls the court\u2019s attention to a domain in which distinct constitutional violations become visible,\u201d Halley said.</span></p> <p><span>The brief comes nearly three months after 47 of the 81 HLS faculty members sent a letter to University President Lawrence H.

{"title": "A Vision Thing | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Visitors to a celebrated new production of Shakespeare\u2019s <i>Henry IV</i> in New York this winter will recognize something in the tale of a carousing son following in the footsteps of his ruling father. At one point, the ailing king tells his son about the political value of Middle East conflict: \u201cBe it their course,\u201d he advises, \u201cto busy giddy minds with foreign quarrels, that action, hence borne out, may waste the memory of former days.\u201d The resonance between Henrys and Georges represents the latest concern of the anti-Bush movement: the relationship of dynasty to democracy.</span></p> <p><span>That\u2019s the focus of a new book by Kevin Phillips, one of a growing number of lifelong Republicans and conservatives unable to stomach the present administration. <i>American Dynasty</i>, argues that the Bush Restoration is particularly sinister, representing not two but four generations of parasitic behavior from a family whose business has focused on profiting from oil, defense, intelligence work and investment banking since World War I.</span></p> <p><span>Gleaning this much from the book jacket, I was on my way to the cash register to buy it when I set it down again, realizing that I just don\u2019t want to know.  As much as it feels necessary to learn the details of the depravity of those in power, the time has come to face the fact that in politics, such knowledge is not enough to dislodge them.</span></p> <p><span>While the left stands aghast at public ignorance on critical matters (like the wide acceptance of a phantom Saddam 9/11 link) it often forgets that for every disturbing fact the public doesn\u2019t know, there are several that the public does know and simply doesn\u2019t care about.  For example, the fact that Bush was not elected president by most of the people and arguably not by the electoral college either the existence of some shady business dealings in Bush\u2019s past, the fact that he is the first president with a criminal record (drunk driving) and that there is something really, really funny about the way this war was put together, have all been aired and seen by the public. But right now, the public would re-elect him anyway.</span></p> <p><span>Democrats who feel emboldened by weaknesses in the administration are right to look forward to developments in 2004 like the special prosecutor investigation of the CIA leak from the White House, or a forthcoming report by the 9/11 commission that will likely embarrass the President. But those who count on it to bring down the administration are urinating on the wrong tree.</span></p> <p><span>That all the dirt on the Bushes is true is not the point; the trouble is that tearing down the President is not enough to elect a new one. We need look no further than the regime changes of Afghanistan and Iraq to see signs that the public is justified in regarding \u201cOut With the Bad\u201d as an incomplete proposition.</span></p> <p><span>That there remain nine presidential candidates among the Democrats, and that voters widely complain that none has swept them off their feet, hints at this problem.  Anyone can criticize Bush (he offers plenty of material to work with), but a clearly articulated, positive vision for America is the sort of thing that would distinguish a candidate, and we can\u2019t seem to find one. Howard Dean, who defines himself by opposition, is as dependent on Bush as the other major candidates, who justify themselves in terms of who can be best one to beat him in November. The result is that in either strain of Democratic campaigning, Bush gets all the attention. To make a compelling case, the left must talk about what it stands for.</span></p> <p><span>Democrats, who are gradually coming to appreciate this, seem daunted by the prospect of developing a vision, but it\u2019s not as monumental a project as it sounds. In this case, the task is less a matter of invention than articulation. The point is not to abandon outrage and invent a vision to replace it\u2014in fact, the positive vision already exists beneath the Left\u2019s complaints, and a formula for bringing it out lies within the outrage itself.</span></p> <p><span>A positive idea is already contained in every complaint and objection raised by Democrats today. Dems can look beneath their outrage at the tax cut to find the sense of justice and mutual responsibility that it offends, and see their anger about the deficit in terms of the kind of future that it sacrifices. How about a catalog of things that we could do if the government only had the resources? We can point out afterwards why, with this crew in power, we can\u2019t afford them. Instead of railing against the way the war has been handled, they can articulate the international order that it has destabilized. Instead of complaints that obscure a positive vision, Democrats can offer a vision in which the cost of continued Republican rule is implied. A real discussion of how much better off we\u2019d be without oil dependence would go a long way in making clear the cost of Bush\u2019s backwards energy policy. Attacks on bad ideas, policies and practices would mean more if the alternative were clear.</span></p> <p><span>Bush-haters often complain of the Orwellian quality of this administration\u2019s approach to the truth. I agree, but the next time the White House announces that two plus two equals five, it won\u2019t be enough to gasp, \u201cYou\u2019re lying!\u201d Someone has to give the right answer.</span></p> <p><span><i>Peter P.

{"title": "Expand AmeriCorps | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>For the tens of thousands of students who depend on AmeriCorps\u2019 average $4,724 grant to pay for college, it can mean the difference between an interesting, rewarding career and a dead-end, minimum-wage job. By putting those students to work on important service projects, AmeriCorps funding also helps build strong, happy communities\u2014and it has bipartisan support across the country. A program like AmeriCorps cries out to be dramatically expanded to help young people build skills while at the same time serving their country in a positive and peaceful way. But President Bush\u2019s latest round of harmful budget cuts took $65 million from the program, forcing it to cut the number of awarded positions by 55 percent, from 67,000 to 30,000. And in slashing funding for our nation\u2019s premier volunteer service program, not only did Bush dash the college dreams of millions, but he also did long-term damage to the economy. Bush\u2019s direct measure to decrease the number of students who can afford college will have a negative impact on America\u2019s future productivity.</span></p> <p><span>Recently, Senate and House negotiators inserted a provision to restore AmeriCorps\u2019 previous funding level\u2014and then some\u2014into the omnibus budget bill that the Senate will vote on this month. Following its passage in the House in December, the bill is expected to pass the Senate after it reconvenes next Tuesday. This is great news. President Bush should sign the bill, which calls for $444 million\u2014$10 million more than he asked for in his 2003 State of the Union Address. Bush said in that speech that he hoped for 75,000 participants in 2004. But a program as effective and popular as AmeriCorps should be double that size. It would be ridiculous to suggest that we need fewer services such as building affordable housing, revitalizing green space, training citizens in public safety, mentoring children and building community partnerships for schools, workplaces and government.</span></p> <p><span>Economically, it is better for the country and individual citizens if more people attend college. Not only is there an average difference of $22,000 in salaries for college and high school graduates, but there is a higher demand in the job market for college graduates with specialized skills. The benefits to America as a whole from one person going to college are greater than the benefits to the individual\u2014what economists call a positive consumption externality. For example, this hypothetical college student would earn more, thus giving the government more tax revenue, and she also might start a company that would generate new jobs. Unfortunately, people decide whether or not to go to college based on benefits to them alone, which means that we have underconsumption of college education.</span></p> <p><span>Some politicians understand these concepts. That is why America has subsidized higher education with federal Pell grants on the state level and with programs like AmeriCorps. Ideally, the financial incentives offered by programs like AmeriCorps make the benefit of college the same for the individual as for society, and lead to more people getting college degrees.</span></p> <p><span>One example of a great AmeriCorps-funded program is YouthBuild, which gives unemployed low-income young people in neighborhoods around the country a chance to complete their education and rebuild their communities by creating affordable housing. In exchange for their service, they get a stipend and spend half their time in classes to take the high school equivalency exam and prepare for college. Dorothy Stoneman \u201963 started YouthBuild in 1978 in East Harlem and funded it initially by appealing to local organizations and later private foundations. But it wasn\u2019t until 1994 that the program was given federal funding to support replicating the model across the country. Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., was an early champion, according to Maria Vugrin, who is communications specialist at YouthBuild. \u201cHe not only introduced the bill but also drummed up a lot of support in Congress and showed why the program is effective,\u201d Vugrin told me. Wider support, she said, came from legislators \u201cwho would like to see programs in their own back yard\u201d and realized that $20,000 a year is a bargain to give somebody an education and help fix up the community. YouthBuild USA, which received $3.2 million dollars from AmeriCorps last year, was hit hard by the funding cuts this year, impacting more than 1,400 youths. \u201cMany students who came into the program expecting to get AmeriCorps education awards aren\u2019t getting that funding now,\u201d Vugrin said. \u201cFor some of them, their driving goal was always to go to college, and the AmeriCorps Education Awards had made it possible because they don\u2019t have the family support to do it another way.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>With the downturn in the economy and new jobs being generated at below-normal levels, demand for AmeriCorps programs like YouthBuild is at an all-time high. \u201cThere are 2.4 million low-income youth across this country who have not completed high school or they\u2019ve finished high school and they don\u2019t have jobs,\u201d said Vugrin. It will be very difficult for these people to get jobs that pay enough to support themselves and their families and help the economy unless the federal government allocates money to train them or send them to college. In the end, it is baffling that AmeriCorps did not receive the pending increases in funding a year ago. A whole generation could be lifted into the middle class, if only we are willing to invest a few fighter jets\u2019 worth of money.</span></p> <p><span><i>Nicholas F.B.

The vengeance of the swaggering global cowboy that has crushed its enemies continues to shock and awe, yet even after the capture of our national bogeyman Saddam Hussein, America remains skittish. Sending back planes from its shores and sniffing for dirty bombs with reckless abandon, the Bush administration and its parrots in the media demand increased vigilance, wariness and, above all, paralyzing fear.</span></p> <p><span>The world must certainly be confused about our national psyche. They are no doubt looking amongst themselves, furrowing their eyebrows, trying to make sense of our about-face. France is probably chilling with Germany somewhere in a corner, saying America needs to \u201crelax\u201d as it methodically sips coffee and thumbs through the <i>Derrida Reader</i>. Britain is letting out a \u201cyeesh\u201d and slowly stalking away from our long embrace. For two years after Sept. 11, the world became used to the stubborn, arrogant, go-it-alone, kill-the-bastards approach of the United States with regard to its terrorist enemies. Now, however, America has become a paranoid victim again after its lengthy, and ultimately dissatisfying, spree of righteous vengeance.</span></p> <p><span>But we seem to be settling in quite well with the new national personality. Americans take solace in Fox News Channel\u2019s omnipresent indication of our nation\u2019s \u201cterror alert\u201d status. Patriotic citizens around the country now raise both the American flag and the orange \u201chigh alert\u201d flag of the Department of Homeland Security. Pundits and anchormen comb through our country\u2019s weak spots and ask the questions that need to be answered, like whether our seaports are safe from oil tankers\u2014which could clearly be used as torpedo missiles\u2014and whether Air France should ever be allowed to enter the country\u2019s airspace. In the recent stint of \u201chigh alertness,\u201d I took the personal step of wearing only orange boxer shorts, to remind myself daily where my fear level should be.</span></p> <p><span>The only way to feel less afraid, according to our president, is to drop bombs\u2014sort of the national equivalent of a sigh of relief. But, while the president ponders the question of \u201cWho Would Jesus Bomb?\u201d there are some hints that it\u2019s time to kick our fear habit. For instance, New Yorkers are, by and large, not scared. For some reason the people of New York seem a lot more confident and a lot less fearful about terrorism than people from Bush\u2019s red states. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay of Texas was afraid to simply sleep in Manhattan for the upcoming Republican National Convention in New York this September; instead, he planned to charter a cruise shop docked in the Hudson River for himself and his fellow right-wingers. Though the plan was recently dropped due to mounting criticism, it goes to show that fear, according to Republicans like DeLay, is patriotic and that New York is an island of un-American bravery, useful only for exploitation purposes.</span></p> <p><span>But perhaps the best reason that we should collectively grow a spine is that if we have to live in fear, then the terrorists have won\u2014not to mention the Republicans. And we all know what that would mean: no more sex for anyone\u2026ever.</span></p> <p><span><i>Erol N. Gulay is an editorial editor.</i></span></p>"}

Dowell decision in 1991, which weakened the mandate to desegregate schools.</span></p> <p><span>Orfield\u2014who has conducted a number of similar studies in the past\u2014argued that as a result of the decision white students are not learning alongside minority students, especially blacks.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cExcept in the South and Southwest, most students have little contact with minority students,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Another contributing factor is the growth of the Latino and Asian populations, he said. Public schools that were previously 80 percent white in the 1960s are now only 60 percent white and, according to Orfield, the percentage of white students in the classroom is falling across the country.</span></p> <p><span>Segregation, though also an issue for the Hispanic population, differs from the black community, he said, because there have never been any desegregation efforts aimed at the Hispanic population. He said that Latinos have lived in increasingly segregated neighborhoods since the late 1960s.</span></p> <p><span>The study found the West to be the most segregated area for Latinos, but Orfield contended that New York is now the epicenter for both Latino and black segregation.  He also said that in general rural communities are more integrated than suburban and metropolitan areas.</span></p> <p><span>The study found Kentucky to be the most integrated state, and Orfield portrayed Louisville as a model because desegregatation policies are supported by the community.</span></p> <p><span>The larger implications of these findings, Orfield held, are the strong correlations he found between segregation and lower test scores.</span></p> <p><span>Arguing that diversity enhances education, Orfield recommended a number of social policy solutions meant to reverse the resegregation trends.</span></p> <p><span>Denouncing President Bush\u2019s recent decision to bypass Congress and seat a Federal judge from Mississippi on the Fifth Circuit\u2019s Court of Appeals, Orfield called for judicial appointees who \u201cunderstand race.\u201d He also criticized both Democrats and Republicans for their inability to address segregation issues.</span></p> <p><span>Orfield also derided the Bush administration\u2019s  \u201cNo Child Left Behind\u201d initiative, saying that in demanding that all schools progress equally, the program will punish segregated schools that lag behind.</span></p> <p><span>Winthrop Professor of History Stephan Thernstrom said Orfield\u2019s past findings of increased segregation are simply not true, asserting that Orfield examines types of segregation that yield the results he is looking for.</span></p> <p><span>Thernstrom further argued that Orfield\u2019s conception of diversity as an essential component of education is flawed.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cRacial composition does not determine the level of learning,\u201d said Thernstrom, who along with his wife Abigail recently published \u201cNo Excuses: Closing the Racial Gap in Education.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>He said he recognizes the challenges associated with race and education, but emphasized that focusing on desegregation is not the way to improve education.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt is a very curious view that black or Latino or Asian children cannot learn without a majority of white classmates. It is old-fashioned, liberal ideology,\u201d said Thernstrom, asserting that the logic behind Orfield\u2019s assumption about integration\u2019s potential to improve minority education assumes that blacks and Hispanics must be able to model their white peers in order to have a \u201cproper education.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>And citing the same statistics used by Orfield, Thernstrom said that trends which appear to show resegregation are simply a function of declining white enrollments.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt is inevitable in schools that there are fewer whites in schools. There are less to go around. We can\u2019t helicopter kids in from Utah or Vermont,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Thernstrom agreed with Orfield on the need to improve the nation\u2019s schools, but instead of focusing on problem-plagued urban schools, Thernstrom advocated giving parents vouchers that would allow them to enroll their children in private, charter or parochial schools.</span></p> <p><span>He cited KIPP Academy in Bronx, NY, and Frederick Douglass in Newark, NJ as examples of excellent charter schools without a white population, attributing their success to discipline, excellent teaching and more hours devoted to instruction.</span></p>"}

Gephardt cancelled a planned to trip to New Hampshire Monday night and announced yesterday that he would drop out of the race.</span></p> <p><span>The defeat was a stunning setback for Dean, who up until a few weeks ago had enjoyed a comfortable lead in Iowa. Gephardt had been projected to finish a clear second. But by Monday, Kerry and Edwards had moved into a statistical tie with Dean and Gephardt, making this one of the most exciting and important caucuses in years.</span></p> <p><span>Although the Iowa caucuses are typically written off as somewhat irrelevant to the national primary competition, the surprisingly strong finishes of Kerry and Edwards there Monday throws a national primary race once written off as a two-way clash between Dean and retired Gen. Wesley Clark back into play.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s a four-horse race right now,\u201d said Institute of Politics Director Daniel R. Glickman. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be decided by Tuesday night.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>As the spotlight shifts to New Hampshire, site of the first major primary vote next Tuesday, the momentum Kerry gained with his Iowa victory has already given him a bounce. Although he had trailed Dean by 30 percent at one point, the latest Reuters/MSNBC/Zogby poll shows Dean leading Kerry 25 to 23 percent, with a four percent margin of error.</span></p> <p><span>Glickman said both Kerry and Edwards would reap benefits from their strong finishes in Iowa, but he cautioned that New Hampshire remains up for grabs.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis is a very, very big victory for both Kerry and Edwards,\u201d Glickman said. \u201cIt propels them in publicity and money, much needed money. But there\u2019s an eternity between now and next Tuesday.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>He said Kerry and Edwards had carried the day largely by convincing Iowans that they had the best chance of beating President Bush in November.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think the voters are looking first and foremost to electability, and the voters of Iowa at least thought Kerry and Edwards were the most electable,\u201d Glickman said.</span></p> <p><span>To get his campaign back on track, Dean has to project a more likeable and positive image, Glickman said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cRight now, Dean has to restore a sense of likeablility and stability to his campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cParticularly his performance last night\u2014it didn\u2019t reinforce stability....He needs to show, \u2018He\u2019s going to be a sensible, strong, stable president, with a little sense of humor as well.\u2019\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Glickman added that negative campaigning had not served Dean and Gephardt well on Monday because it reflected a focus on the past rather than a focus on the future.</span></p> <p><span>In Monday\u2019s caucus, each voter selected a candidate by gathering in that candidate\u2019s corner. Then, candidates that garnered less than 15 percent were knocked out and their voters were allowed to choose another candidate. The caucuses took place in town halls, school gyms and even private homes.</span></p> <p><span>Iowa\u2019s caucus format may have added percentage points to Kerry and Edwards\u2019 decisive victories. But Glickman said he thought that although the numbers may have been slightly inflated by the caucus system, Kerry and Edwards\u2019 major leads were significant and close to what they would have garnered in a standard election.</span></p> <p><span><b>The College Crowd</b></span></p> <p><span>Back at Harvard, student politicos said the surprise finish in Iowa has energized undergraduates and will drive greater participation in New Hampshire campaigning.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard College Democrats President Andrew J. Frank \u201905 said turnout among college students in Iowa was higher than in previous years.</span></p> <p><span>The youth turnout, he said, validated candidates\u2019 focus on college voters and shows that students can be wooed effectively.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cYoung people are starting to get involved in the process, more so than in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the candidates are right to court that block.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Nicholas F.B. Smyth \u201905, president of Harvard Students for Kerry, said the caucuses had mobilized support for Kerry on campus.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt was great to see the people who are switching over to Kerry, and the people who have been supporting Kerry all along, but kind of got disheartened by the New Hampshire polls and the third place [polling in Iowa],\u201d Smyth said. \u201cNow we have tons of people excited to go up to New Hampshire this week and over the weekend.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Brittani S. Head \u201906, president of Harvard Students for Edwards, said Monday\u2019s results were giving Edwards a similar boost among undergraduates.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe have a bunch of people throughout the year who said, \u2018We like Edwards but he\u2019s not polling high enough,\u2019\u201d Head said. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely been a tangible effect on enthusiasm for the campaign on willingness to get involved.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Even Harvard Students for Lieberman saw the benefit of Iowa\u2014a reminder that big comebacks are possible. Lieberman, who had opted not to campaign in Iowa, currently trails by 18 points in New Hampshire.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cKerry\u2019s unexpected victory has totally turned things around,\u201d said Rebecca E. Rubins \u201905. \u201cIt showed more than anything that everything is totally variable.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Frank said the College Democrats will send at least 50 students to campaign in New Hampshire over the next week.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cPeople are really excited,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the most interesting presidential primary that there has been in a long, long time and there may be in a long, long time\u2014now or never.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff writer Stephen M.

{"title": "Sit This One Out, Ralph | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>According to recent news reports, Ralph Nader is now in the process of deciding whether to seek the presidency for the third time in as many election cycles. While discussing the possibility of making another run for the White House, the longtime consumer advocate and ardent critic of the Bush administration described Democrats as \u201cunwilling to go all out to stop the destructive tax cuts for the wealthy,\u201d saying that \u201cthey have been soft on corporate crime. They have gone along in almost every issue except judicial appointments. They have cowered, surrendered or divided themselves.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>This brand of rhetoric is reminiscent of the rationale that Nader articulated for his candidacy three years ago. In a campaign speech delivered barely a month before the 2000 general election, he declared that \u201cthe only difference between the Republican and Democratic parties is the velocities with which their knees hit the floor when corporations knock on their door.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>We all know what happened next. Nader\u2019s vote totals in Florida and New Hampshire easily exceeded the margins by which then-Governor Bush edged out Al Gore \u201969 in those states. Exit polls from 2000 indicate that, had Nader not been in the race, his supporters would have voted disproportionately for the Democratic ticket, and a win in either state would have ensured Gore the presidency.</span></p> <p><span>The closeness of the last few national elections suggests that the 2004 presidential race could be another nail-biter. Should he step into the presidential fray next year, Nader could tip the balance of power to the Republicans once more. Judging by his recent comments, it appears that he will attempt yet again to rationalize his candidacy by claiming that there are few meaningful differences between the Democratic and Republican parties.</span></p> <p><span>However, a review of the Bush administration\u2019s record to date suggests that such a claim is either remarkably disingenuous or equally naive. The administration has racked up three tax cuts in three years, fundamentally altering the government\u2019s long-term fiscal outlook in the process. According to a recent Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center report, the tax cuts have helped to convert a 10 year surplus of $1.3 trillion into a 10 year deficit of $4.5 trillion. This fiscal deterioration has tremendously important implications for our government\u2019s ability to preserve Social Security, Medicare and other critical programs for future generations.</span></p> <p><span>In addition, the increasing bellicosity of the United States has recast our image abroad, strained our relationships with many longtime allies and embroiled us in a thorny nation-building enterprise in Iraq. President Bush will also probably make at least two lifetime appointments to the Supreme Court (he will be all but guaranteed this opportunity if he wins reelection), which has the potential to transform the legal landscape on issues ranging from abortion to affirmative action.</span></p> <p><span>This is only a partial list, but it suffices to illustrate a critical point: The Bush administration is pursuing an ambitious and far-reaching policy agenda whose repercussions will be felt for decades to come. One may try to assert that a Democratic president would pursue basically the same agenda, but a comparison between, say, the Clinton and Bush administrations\u2014with respect to fiscal policy, foreign policy, environmental policy and a host of other issues\u2014simply belies this notion. Remember, for example, that President Clinton <i>raised</i> taxes in the first year of his presidency and left office with the budget in <i>surplus</i>, quite a contrast to the situation we now face.</span></p> <p><span>As fundamental as the differences are between the Democratic and Republican parties, it is certainly the case that a Nader candidacy would, in some respects, present an even starker contrast. However, it is also certain that Nader would have essentially no chance of actually winning a general election\u2014he received about three percent of the national vote in 2000.</span></p> <p><span>There are moments when forward-thinking leaders look to the future and realize that they can best serve the principles they hold dear by fighting losing battles in the short run, so that they can reshape the debates of their day in the long run. This is not one of those moments. The future has already arrived, and the long run has begun to play itself out in vivid fashion. Nader can best honor the causes that he champions by sitting this one out.</span></p> <p><span><i>Adam T.

John Edwards captured a must-win victory here last night, capturing the South Carolina Democratic primary by a margin of 15 points over Sen. John F.

Glickman.</span></p> <p><span>Twenty-two Harvard students joined the political frenzy here over intersession, flying down from Cambridge to volunteer for four presidential campaigns. The trip was partially funded through the Institute of Politics and was organized and sponsored by the Harvard College Democrats (HCD).</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe wanted to give people a feel for real campaigning, especially presidential primary campaigning,\u201d said HCD President Andrew J. Frank \u201905, who volunteered for the Edwards campaign here. \u201cWe had the resources to do it.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>South Carolina was a critical test for Edwards. The state garners national attention as the first primary held in the south and is also Edwards\u2019 place of birth. A heavy investment of funds and time helped Edwards fend off a last-minute surge by Kerry.</span></p> <p><span>Elsewhere, Kerry easily took the Missouri primary with 51 percent of the vote, while Edwards came in second with less than half that total. Gen. Wesley K. Clark took Oklahoma by a slim margin\u2014almost 1,300 votes\u2014last night.</span></p> <p><span>In South Carolina, Edwards had received 45 percent of the ballots cast here yesterday with 94 percent of precincts reporting.</span></p> <p><span>Kerry was in second place with 30 percent of the vote.</span></p> <p><span>The Harvard volunteers have been working on the campaigns since their arrival in Charleston last Thursday. Students fanned out into various areas of the city to canvass, knocking on doors and distributing literature about their respective candidate. Though canvassing and publicity were the major activities of the week, students also helped phonebank and organized campaign activities.</span></p> <p><span>Frank passed the afternoon of election day at a local taxicab station.</span></p> <p><span>All of the campaigns offer voters a ride to the polls to help draw out support. Frank was the day\u2019s \u201cdispatcher\u201d for the Edwards camp; residents were encouraged to call the campaign office, which would then arrange a ride with a taxi.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m just sitting around,\u201d Frank said.</span></p> <p><span><b>Kerry Triumphant</b></span></p> <p><span>In the rest of the country, Kerry carried the day, according to political experts.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cYou cannot underestimate Kerry\u2019s wins tonight,\u201d Glickman said. \u201cKerry remains the strongest candidate. His speech tonight was exceptionally powerful.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Even so, Kerry\u2019s supporters in South Carolina had hoped for a win in the state.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cFor the amount of time Kerry has been in this state to do so well, it shows how electable he really is,\u201d said Kerry supporter Lakshmi Sridharan \u201906, who volunteered here for the campaign over the past week.</span></p> <p><span>As the Kerry and Edwards campaigns gathered momentum from yesterday\u2019s results, Sen. Joseph I.  Lieberman\u2019s efforts sputtered to a close.</span></p> <p><span>Lieberman exited the race after a disappointing showing in Delaware.</span></p> <p><span>Former Vermont Governor and onetime Democratic frontrunner Howard B. Dean was polling in fifth place in South Carolina at press time, trailing behind the Rev. Al Sharpton and Clark.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cNobody\u2019s happy about it obviously,\u201d Greg M. Schmidt \u201906 said of Dean\u2019s showing.</span></p> <p><span>An HCD officer and Dean supporter, Schmidt volunteered for the campaign here this week. But Schmidt noted that Dean had decided to bypass last night\u2019s slate of primaries and look ahead to Michigan and Washington.</span></p> <p><span>Climenko Professor of Law Charles J. Ogletree, an adviser to Sharpton, said the candidate\u2019s third-place showing was proof that Sharpton \u201chas to be taken seriously.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201c[Sharpton] continues raising issues that matter to a broad segment of the community that feels disenfranchised,\u201d Ogletree said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe continues to be a persistent factor\u201d in the race, Ogletree said.</span></p> <p><span><b>Harvard in Charleston</b></span></p> <p><span>Polls opened at 7 a.m. yesterday morning in SouthCarolina, and the campaigns got into gear early.</span></p> <p><span>The Dean volunteers were up first, meeting at their downtown headquarters at 5:45 a.m.</span></p> <p><span>According to David C. Marshall \u201907, the group then traveled to an \u201cundisclosed location\u201d in Charleston for a strategy meeting with the entire local Dean staff. A fire alarm went off as the meeting was about to begin, leading some staff members to suspect foul play on the part of rival campaigns, Marshall said.</span></p> <p><span>By 8:30 a.m., the Harvard volunteers on the Dean staff were dispersed throughout the downtown area here, wielding campaign signs and stickers to promote \u201cpoll visibility\u201d\u2014which required standing outside voting places and hawking candidates to Charlestonians on the way to cast their ballots.</span></p> <p><span>Marshall, who was assigned to the College of Charleston voting place, was \u201cexpecting some high-tech voter thing,\u201d but was surprised to find a relatively simple operation. This veteran Deaniac\u2014who worked briefly for the campaign in New Hampshire\u2014 had been instructed to report a vote tally from the polling place every two hours.</span></p> <p><span>Around 7:30 a.m., Kerry\u2019s Harvard volunteers arrived at their offices, located two floors below the Dean headquarters.</span></p> <p><span>Workers were immediately sent out on \u201clit-drops\u201d around the city, leaving flyers and candidate information on parked cars and in stores and restaurants. Visibility was a high priority as campaigners hoped to capture the ballots of still-undecided voters.</span></p> <p><span>Jonathan D. Einkauf \u201906, who is working for the Kerry campaign here, demonstrated some of the more irreverent tactics the Harvard contingent brought to the South Carolina.</span></p> <p><span>After taping a large Kerry poster onto a wall outside of a Food Lion grocery store, Einkauf was confronted by an employee.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s gotta go,\u201d the man said solemnly.</span></p> <p><span>After attempting to negotiate for a moment, Einkauf relented and took the sign down.

Whelan \u201905, a Cabot House resident from Hanover, Mass., and a lifetime Patriots fan, said that even if the University were in session, he \u201cabsolutely\u201d would have missed class for yesterday\u2019s parade.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI could have watched it on TV, but it\u2019s just so much better being there,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Whelan said he and a friend pushed enough to reach the stage.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe were right by the stage and got absolutely crunched.  We honestly couldn\u2019t move one foot,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>The championship was the organization\u2019s second in three years, and the win in Houston marked the 15th consecutive victory for a team that many league observers underestimated earlier this season.  The Patriots\u2019 first-ever championship in 2002 inspired an estimated 1.2 million people to pack the streets of Boston, a city of under 600,000 residents, according to the 2000 U.S. Census.</span></p> <p><span>The Boston Police Department (BPD) estimated that 1.5 million fans witnessed the Patriots procession yesterday afternoon.  While many huddled together at street level, the most innovative climbed on top of mailboxes, into nearby trees and on rooftops to get a better view.  One man straddled the statue of Samuel Adams in front of historic Faneuil Hall at Quincy Market, wrapping his legs around the bronze head of the famed revolutionary figure, to the cheers of the crowd below.</span></p> <p><span>Though thousands of people skipped work and school due to \u201cPatriots Fever,\u201d those working in the parade district pressed their faces against the office windows overlooking the procession and rally.  A construction crew, renovating a building three blocks away from City Hall, perched on the scaffolding around the 20th story for a bird\u2019s eye view of the various speeches.</span></p> <p><span>Emceed by sportscaster Gil Santos, the ceremony began with a brief but grateful address by team owner Bob Kraft.  \u201cTwo years ago, I told all of you we wouldn\u2019t be satisfied until we brought another championship to New England, and here it is!\u201d he said, heaving the handcrafted sterling silver Tiffany &amp; Co. trophy into the chilled air.</span></p> <p><span>As the crowd cheered and threw fists upward, confetti machines blew bits of red, white and blue tissue into the wind blowing through the corridors of Cambridge Street.</span></p> <p><span>Several players made references to winning another title.  \u201cOne was nice, two\u2019s a lot nicer, but I need number three,\u201d said quarterback Tom Brady, the two-time Super Bowl MVP who at 26 years old is the youngest quarterback ever to win two championships.</span></p> <p><span>Kicker Adam Vinatieri, who kicked the game-winning field goal, held his hand up and said, \u201cI\u2019ve got two [championship rings] on my fingers, and the last time I checked, I got plenty more of them.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>For back-up guard Jamil Soriano \u201903, the combination of an NFL championship and victory parade was overwhelming.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt was definitely a once-in-a lifetime experience for me, to win a Super Bowl and come back to Boston to see all the fans cutting class and taking breaks from work,\u201d said Soriano, who played left guard for Harvard, and was a part of the Patriots\u2019 practice squad all season long.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt was unreal, having all these people cheering for a team that I\u2019m a part of.  Coming from Harvard from a championship team was amazing, but to be a part of this Super Bowl team was just unbelievable,\u201d Soriano said. \u201cAfter being with three or four [NFL] teams, I\u2019m not one to believe in fate or destiny, but something good happened to be with this kind of team.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>While in Houston, Soriano said that he \u201cbumped into\u201d former President George H. W. Bush, singer Beyonc\u00e9 and rock star Kid Rock.</span></p> <p><span>Reminiscent of the 2002 Super Bowl celebration, Kraft, Brady and Head Coach Bill Belichick did an awkward victory dance for the crowd, egged on by star cornerback Ty Law, who asked the deejay to put on the hip-hop song, \u201cEncore\u201d by Jay-Z.  Linebacker Willie McGinest joined in, dancing the \u201cCrip Walk,\u201d while Belichick extended both arms forward with visible reluctance and made a Frankenstein-esque motion.</span></p> <p><span>In another humorous moment, wide receiver Troy Brown faced the crowd trophy in-hand, removed his dark sunglasses to reveal a black eye and broken nose sustained in Sunday\u2019s game, and yelled \u201cBingo!\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The BPD along with federal police showed a heavy presence along the parade route and particularly at City Hall, where hundreds of officers patrolled the plaza and barricades.  Despite a pervasive scent of alcohol, a BPD spokesperson said only seven arrests were made.  Also present were Massachusetts Gov. W. Mitt Romney and Lt. Gov.

We thought maybe we want to show what democracy he is talking about. There is genocide in Turkey,\u201d said Sardar D. Jajan, a Syrian-born Kurdish resident of Watertown who organized the protest. The protestors said the Turkish government displaces Kurds and represses their political efforts.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cOne of the greatest things about the forum is that it gives a chance for people to have some confrontation with world leaders,\u201d said Brenda Shaffer, research director of the KSG\u2019s Caspian Studies Program, which sponsored the Turkish prime minister\u2019s visit to Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>Erdogan was subdued until the end of his speech, when he displayed the charisma for which he is popular in Turkey.</span></p> <p><span>Gesturing expressively and straying from the prepared text of his comments, Erdogan stressed the symbolic meaning of Turkey\u2019s possible admission to the EU.</span></p> <p><span>Turkey\u2019s accession to the EU would prove the organization is neither a \u201cclub of coal and steel\u201d nor a \u201cChristian club,\u201d but a \u201cunion of political values,\u201d Erdogan said to whistling and shouts of approval from some members of the audience.</span></p> <p><span>Erdogan became even more emotional when he referred to the November terrorist attacks on Istanbul, stressing that Islam does not promote violence.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI\u2019m talking to you as a Muslim...killing one soul equals destroying the house of God,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should take good care of our youth and we should not let our youth turn out to be terrorists.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Erdogan is widely viewed as a controversial and popular figure. His emphasis on the separation between religion and state has been seen by some as inconsistent with his Islamic past.</span></p> <p><span>The event, which occurred over intersession, was attended primarily by the press, graduate students and residents of nearby communities. Many audience members were of Turkish descent.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect so many inside jokes and questions being asked in Turkish,\u201d Lara A. Setrakian \u201904 said.</span></p> <p><span>Laughter and cheers from Turkish-speaking members of the audience often preempted the English translations of the questions and answers.</span></p> <p><span>Shaffer agreed that the speech was \u201csort of like when you go to a foreign film and people laugh at the jokes before you can get the subtitles.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff writer Tina Wang can be reached at tinawang@fas.harvard.edu.</i></span></p>"}
{"title": "Students Take Primary Role in N.H. | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Jessica R. Rubin-wills", "body": "<p><span>NEW HAMPSHIRE\u2014Blue-books are still closed and Harvard\u2019s exam rooms won\u2019t open for business for another four hours when Gregory M. Schmidt \u201906 steps out into the dark, frigid New Hampshire morning.</span></p> <p><span>Today he will face a test of a different sort than any of his classmates back in Cambridge: former Vermont Gov. Howard B. Dean, his favored candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, is about to begin the last day of the nation\u2019s first primary campaign.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHope not fear, that\u2019s the name of the game,\u201d Schmidt says, echoing the slogan emblazoned on the Dean sign he is carrying out to his car.</span></p> <p><span>It is early on Tuesday, Jan. 27, and Schmidt has made the drive up to Nashua, N.H., because he hopes to influence the outcome of this crucial election, where several candidates find themselves neck-and-neck in one of the closest races for the nomination in recent memory.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis is probably the most exciting presidential primary that I might ever live through in my next 30 years,\u201d says Andrew J. Frank \u201905, the president of the Harvard College Democrats and a supporter of Sen. John R. Edwards, D-N.C.</span></p> <p><span>Student groups on campus have sent up delegations to campaign for candidates including Dean, Edwards, retired Gen. Wesley K. Clark, Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., and Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, D-Conn. Over the course of the fall semester, these students have forayed north, leaving behind the Yard and Lamont to enter the alternate universe that swallows this small state every four years.</span></p> <p><span>They are there, adding their voices to the dull roar of the crowded Democratic field. As the candidates descend on New Hampshire, all eyes look to a primary that can turn the tide of the national election.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI\u2019ve been telling everyone that my most important exam is the New Hampshire primaries,\u201d says Nicholas F.B. Smyth \u201905, the president of Harvard Students for Kerry. \u201cToo bad it won\u2019t go on my transcript.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Later on Tuesday, Kerry will ride to a convincing victory at 39 percent of the vote, with Dean coming in second and Clark and Edwards neck and neck for third and fourth place. But before any results are in, the students from Harvard will hit the streets of New Hampshire in an effort to make a difference, however small, in their candidates\u2019 vote totals.</span></p> <p><span><b>Door-to-Door Democracy</b></span></p> <p><span>Around 10 a.m on Monday, Jan. 26, Smyth leaves an unfinished paper behind him and starts up his van.</span></p> <p><span>The Granite State\u2019s polls will open in less than 24 hours.</span></p> <p><span>Joining him are J.T. Scarry \u201907, also a Crimson editor, and Adam T. Thomas, a second-year student in the Kennedy School of Government\u2019s doctoral program in public policy.</span></p> <p><span>All three say this round of shoe-leather campaigning will trump earlier ones.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIn the past we\u2019ve been turned down a lot because people don\u2019t want to talk about politics that early,\u201d says Smyth, who is also a Crimson editor. \u201cToday [we] can say the election is hours away.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>They plan to engage in a series of individual encounters with New Hampshire\u2019s registered Democrats and independents, trying to bring the voters over to Kerry\u2019s side with a bit of charm and an arsenal of campaign-approved slogans and facts.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cYou get into a conversation that leads to them renouncing their deviant views,\u201d Scarry says wryly.</span></p> <p><span>Armed with a photocopied map of suburban Bedford, N.H., a list of registered voters and a stack of two-sided glossy color fliers, the three students venture out on the road.</span></p> <p><span>There is no shortage of New Hampshire\u2019s legendary headstrong voters, who have the opportunity every four years to play a major role in determining candidates\u2019 political futures.</span></p> <p><span>One man with a patrician accent furiously accuses Kerry of remaining \u201cinvisible as a senator until two years ago\u201d before launching into a tirade against Kerry\u2019s senior colleague from Massachusetts, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy \u201954-\u201956. Others curtly declare their unshakable allegiance to Dean or President George W. Bush before closing the door in a Kerry canvasser\u2019s face.</span></p> <p><span>But for every voter whose mind is made up, there are several who give some indication, however slight, of wavering. It is these residents who get the full treatment.</span></p> <p><span>A man who says he is \u201csort of\u201d Republican but \u201ca big Clinton fan\u201d is told about Kerry\u2019s insistence on keeping Bush\u2019s tax cuts for the middle class. A woman who says abortion is the only issue that matters to her is reminded of the senator\u2019s longstanding support of Roe v. Wade. Another woman, whose 31-year-old son has been unemployed for more than a year because his company moved to Switzerland, hears about the senator\u2019s promise to close tax loopholes for such corporations.</span></p> <p><span>Finally, after visiting more than 50 homes in four and a half hours of canvassing, the students head for an evening rally in nearby Derry.</span></p> <p><span>In a high school gym, a determined Kerry paces back and forth across the stage, drawing roars of applause as he shouts out the talking points made more modestly by the three canvassers earlier in the day.</span></p> <p><span>The three students stay to the end, lining up to see Kerry up close as he leaves the room. And then, a little after 7 p.m., Smyth and Scarry get back in the van and head for Cambridge.</span></p> <p><span>After all, Smyth still has to finish a 25-page term paper on campaign finance reform due the next afternoon.</span></p> <p><span><b>The Night Before </b></span></p> <p><span>As Kerry wraps up his speech on Monday evening, Schmidt and two other students are traveling up to Nashua to campaign for his rival, Dean.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe\u2019re staying in zone headquarters, which is a fancy word for some dude\u2019s basement,\u201d Schmidt explains to Ben B. Chung \u201906, who is also a Crimson editor, and Eric P. Lesser \u201907 on their way up.</span></p> <p><span>They are making their trip a week after their candidate\u2019s surprising third-place finish in the Iowa caucuses and the infamous yelp that followed.</span></p> <p><span>Chung says he did not feel the need to be directly involved in the campaign until Dean began to slip in the polls from the front-runner status he had enjoyed earlier in the month.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cTo be perfectly honest, the only reason I\u2019m here is because of Iowa,\u201d Chung says.</span></p> <p><span>Schmidt says the fallout from the caucus has lowered expectations in New Hampshire.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIowa was so bad that if he comes in second or a close second it will seem like a victory,\u201d Schmidt says. \u201cA lot of it depends on factors we can\u2019t control, but the factors we can control, that\u2019s why we\u2019re driving up right now.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Schmidt has made this drive many times over the past six months. Last summer, he worked at headquarters in Nashua to win over voters to the Dean campaign.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMy full-time job was basically trying to make friends in New Hampshire,\u201d Schmidt says.</span></p> <p><span>Later that night the three students arrive at the Nashua office, where the rooms are crowded with volunteers who joke about their lack of sleep as they put together signs and assemble packets for the following day.</span></p> <p><span>In nearby Derry, Clark\u2019s local office buzzes with anticipation the night before the polls open.</span></p> <p><span>Clark has had an outpost in New Hampshire since November, just two months after announcing his candidacy, and since then Harvard students have been coming up on weekends to help canvass, says Henry C. Quillen \u201900, a student at the KSG.</span></p> <p><span>Since he came up to campaign for Clark in the first week of January, Quillen has been involved in making \u201cthousands of phone calls\u201d and fighting to get the retired general\u2019s name out among New Hampshire\u2019s voters. Quillen says it seems as if the election has taken over local life, at least for a few weeks.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cSome people in New Hampshire are being called 20 times a day by candidates,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s frustrating for both you and them.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Tomorrow, all that work will come to an end in this state. This is an important primary for Clark\u2014the first time he will go head to head and vote for vote against his Democratic rivals.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to think,\u201d Quillen says. \u201cWe could have a really great day or a really lousy day tomorrow.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>And what if the second option comes true?</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAt the end of the day, the winner of the New Hampshire primary will only have won a few delegates,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span><b>Cool Runnings</b></span></p> <p><span>Just after 6 a.m. on election day, eleven Edwards supporters gather in their office in Londonderry, N.H., to make the final push in a campaigning effort that has consumed their last few weeks.</span></p> <p><span>A few minutes later, Jessica R. Rosenfeld \u201907 appears, bringing the volunteers 15 McDonald\u2019s biscuits\u2014and some bad news.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe woman at McDonald\u2019s is not voting,\u201d Rosenfeld reports, and the room reacts with dismay. The last few months have been spent trying to motivate every last New Hampshire resident of age to vote today, to vote Democrat and to vote Edwards. Any stay-at-home voter is a setback, it seems.</span></p> <p><span>Rosenfeld and several others squeeze into a van to head off for the local polling places, where they will hold signs and make last-minute attempts to pull votes in Edwards\u2019 direction.</span></p> <p><span>Their simple approach draws from Edwards\u2019 reputation as a positive campaigner. According to Rosenfeld, they aim to be not the most aggressive campaign, but the \u201cnicest.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>After showing up at Grinell School at about 6:45 a.m. and planting a row of Edwards signs lining the entrance to the school\u2019s parking lot, the volunteers set up camp on the sidewalk outside the school and launch their charm offensive in the freezing cold.</span></p> <p><span>Volunteers from rival campaigns will show up in varying force over the next hour, but for now Edwards\u2019 supporters are the only ones standing beside arriving voters. Just about every voter gets a bright \u201cgood morning\u201d as he or she walks in to the poll, and the volunteers flash warm grins at all whose eyes they can catch.</span></p> <p><span>The weather, in fact, is well below freezing at all times, necessitating a mitten run, a hot-chocolate expedition and more than a few temporary trips to warm up in the waiting van while one or two volunteers remain outside.</span></p> <p><span>Like many volunteers, Rosenfeld wears chemically-reactive \u201cToasti-Toes\u201d and hand-warmers throughout the day.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI came up with four shirts for each day, and I\u2019ve definitely worn all of them,\u201d she says on the virtues of layering.</span></p> <p><span>At one point a postal worker, stopping on his route to vote, asks why the campaigns are out so early and in such cold. The volunteers inform him that they are just \u201cdedicated.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI\u2019m dedicated,\u201d the mailman says with a laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re just lunatics!\u201d</span></p> <p><span><b>Making a List, Checking It Twice</b></span></p> <p><span>At a Nashua elementary school, the Dean volunteers are also ready to brave the cold when the polls open at 6 a.m.</span></p> <p><span>While Edwards supporters court voters with smiles, Dean\u2019s volunteers strive to bring to the polls all those who have already pledged their support.</span></p> <p><span>Armed with a list of 161 Dean households in his assigned section of Nashua, Schmidt\u2019s first job is to stand near the booths and listen as voters give their names to the attendants. After checking the names against the list, Schmidt and the other volunteers plan to go directly to the homes of any who haven\u2019t voted yet, helping to arrange for rides if needed.</span></p> <p><span>Around 8 a.m., Schmidt trades the comfort of the warm gym for the cold of the parking lot, pulling aside voters as they leave the polls to identify who supports Dean.</span></p> <p><span>He jokes that he doesn\u2019t mind bothering the voters once they\u2019ve cast their ballots.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf we piss them off when they\u2019re leaving the voting booths, we\u2019re not going to need their vote for another nine months,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>Volunteers aren\u2019t allowed to talk to voters inside the polling place, and they must leave their Dean paraphenalia outside, since no campaigning is allowed within 100 feet of the entrance.</span></p> <p><span>But outside, Schmidt and Chung are free to make up chants as they wave signs for Dean.</span></p> <p><span>Schmidt is working on just three hours of sleep in two days, after pulling an all-nighter to study for an exam the night before heading to New Hampshire.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI may just collapse at some point,\u201d he says. \u201cHopefully tonight after the raucous victory celebration, there will be time for some sleep.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><b>One Big Party</b></span></p> <p><span>As the student volunteers spend the day campaigning, they vie for valuable sidewalk real estate and struggle to shout over other campaigns\u2019 supporters.</span></p> <p><span>But Rosenfeld says New Hampshire\u2019s college-age workers have formed a tight-knit community in the last few months.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s like spring break in the cold,\u201d she says.</span></p> <p><span>Despite the occasional sniping remark, the warring Democratic factions seem to feel some camaraderie\u2014and for the students in Derry, there\u2019s even some Harvard pride.</span></p> <p><span>Over the course of the day, Jeff D. Wilf \u201907 and Peter C. Mulcahy \u201907, who is also a Crimson editor, show up to hold Kerry signs, and Todd T. Rogers, a graduate student at Harvard, arrives to support Clark.</span></p> <p><span>The students chat during down time as if they were sitting over Sunday waffles in a dining hall rather than clutching staple-gunned campaign materials in the cold before the start of the work week.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s not opposition,\u201d Rogers explains. \u201cWe sort of have mocking, jesting punches at each other, but everyone knows we\u2019re on the same team in November.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In Nashua, when a car drives into the parking lot with a \u201cBush-Cheney\u201d sign in the window, supporters for all the Democratic campaigns join in a loud chorus of boos.\u201cThat\u2019s one thing we can all agree on!\u201d one volunteer shouts.</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff writer Jessica R.

I\u2019m a 30 second decision,\u201d he says. \u201cNo one has to evaluate me and my character.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Jahncke portrays his candidacy as a referendum that will bring together an anti-war vote that would otherwise be split among the Democratic candidates.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cOne does not do this with any illusion that you\u2019ll be a vice presidential nominee,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m the equivalent of a ballot initiative to oppose and change the current administration\u2019s foreign policy doctrine of unilateralism as expressed in the Iraq war.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>He offers voters the option of a protest vote that won\u2019t cost them their chance to choose among the high-profile presidential candidates.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cFor an unknown to offer himself as a president is a quixotic adventure,\u201d Jahncke says. \u201cBut the vice-presidential slot allows them to still vote for a major national candidate and vote for me.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Though he describes himself as an independent, Jahncke says he chose to run on the Republican Party\u2019s primary ballot to make it explicit that he is a direct challenge to Cheney, whom he calls the \u201cprincipal architect\u201d of America\u2019s foreign policy. He suggests Democrats vote for him as a write-in.</span></p> <p><span>But in another twist of the New Hampshire political wheel, Cheney\u2019s name won\u2019t even be on the ballot; Jahncke\u2019s sole opposition will be another anti-war candidate, Flora Bleckner of Hewlett Harbor, Long Island.</span></p> <p><span><b>Anatomy of a Plan</b></span></p> <p><span>The idea behind Jahncke\u2019s bid for the nation\u2019s second highest post took root last year, but the sentiment behind it is decades old.</span></p> <p><span>As he cast around for a way to voice his opposition to foreign policy developments, he thought back to the idealism of his life as an undergraduate at Harvard in the early 1970s.</span></p> <p><span>A government concentrator, Jahncke had opposed the Vietnam War and followed the primary process in New Hampshire with deep interest.</span></p> <p><span>\u201c[Eugene] McCarthy had just launched an extraordinary campaign where he challenged his own party,\u201d Jahncke says of the historic contest. \u201cHe lost in the New Hampshire primary by a hair to Lyndon Johnson, but that tally unseated LBJ.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWith that background I knew the New Hampshire primary to be a fairly wide-open fair\u2014a race where challenges of all kinds are launched. So I started looking around, and lo and behold I found it,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I actually discovered there was something that could be done\u2026I felt an obligation to meet.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Since then, the campaign has pushed other obligations to the side, including the investment and consulting firm that he founded.</span></p> <p><span>In the last month, Jahncke has spent all but four days on the road, working with no advertising budget, and a small staff of volunteers dedicated to getting out his message.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI have spoken where I have been able to find an invitation to speak,\u201d Jahncke says.</span></p> <p><span>Jahncke has begun to receive donations solicited through his campaign website, an \u201cincredibly positive sign,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>And Jahncke says that unlike some minor candidates in the crowded presidential primary field\u2014which originally boasted 37 candidates\u2014his pet-issue is familiar to voters.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMost people are conversant on this issue,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not running on some esoteric health-care plan that has been documented in 150 pages. Voters know the issue [and] have a position.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><b>A Road Less Travelled</b></span></p> <p><span>Despite Jahncke\u2019s efforts, his campaign continues to draw puzzled looks, even from political experts.</span></p> <p><span>Texas A&amp;M Professor George C. Edwards III, editor of Presidential Studies Quarterly, was taken aback by the idea that a candidate could actually run for the vice-presidency.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis is so unusual for anyone to be doing this that there is no literature on this question. I\u2019ve never seen a single article on the broader question of running for vice-president,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>Edwards predicted that the protest behind Jahncke\u2019s candidacy would be drowned out by the hurly-burly of the last days of campaigning.</span></p> <p><span>J. Mark Wrighton, assistant professor of political science at the University of New Hampshire, was another expert surprised that Jahncke\u2019s bid was even possible.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis is actually news to me that you could actually file for vice president,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is going to be interesting.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Jahncke has succeeded in flying beneath election officials\u2019 radar as well.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cUsually the position of vice-president is to raise an issue, but I haven\u2019t paid a lot of attention to it,\u201d New Hampshire Deputy Secretary of State David Scanlon says.</span></p> <p><span>The election system is designed to be participatory, according to Scanlon. The sole requirements were that candidates pay $1,000 and file before the Nov. 3 deadline.</span></p> <p><span>The result, says Garrison Nelson, a professor of political science at the University of Vermont, is the potential for self-aggrandizement.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMr. Red Jahncke may have a nice time printing up lots of buttons and posters, but it sounds like more of an ego trip than anything else,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span><b>The End of the Road </b></span></p> <p><span>Jahncke insists that his campaign is nothing more than a way to empower the voters of New Hampshire. \u201cThis is not about Red Jahncke. I\u2019m not going to run a victory lap.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Jahncke has never before dabbled in politics. He says his wife is supportive, but concerned that he this will be a springboard into other political adventures. But he promises that this bid is the end of the road.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cNormally when one ventures into politics there is a career objective, but not with me,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>Alternately ignored and derided by critics, Jahncke says his campaign is an opportunity to tap into the activism he felt so strongly about as a student\u2014to connect the activists of today at Harvard and beyond with their baby-boomer predecessors.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cStudents through the generations complain about how to make a difference.

{"title": "Defending America\u2019s Troops | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>President Bush\u2019s new budget contains a 7.2 percent cut for the Environmental Protection Agency, a 10 percent reduction for the Small Business Administration and asks for the elimination of Education Department programs that prevent alcohol abuse and high school dropouts. Seven cabinet-level departments and 63 government programs will see slashed appropriations and 65 more will be totally scrapped</span></p> <p><span>under the Bush plan. The bill also proposes a military spending increase of $26.5 billion. Which one doesn\u2019t belong?</span></p> <p><span>We regret to see yet another spending hike for the Pentagon in Bush\u2019s latest budget. With this 7 percent rise, which doesn\u2019t include any supplemental money for Iraq or Afghanistan, military spending in 2005 will surpass the largest defense budgets of the Cold War. And, regrettably, it will almost certainly pass because of a Republican chokehold on the House of Representatives and Senate Democrats\u2019 insecurities about seeming weak on defense. If it has to pass, let\u2019s use the new money wisely\u2014by siphoning it into higher salaries and renovated facilities for American soldiers, not buying more spy planes.</span></p> <p><span>This may seem like a given, considering Bush\u2019s campaign promise to improve soldiers\u2019 quality of life. But despite repeated defense budget increases, the Bush administration has shown little regard for the average soldier. Last November, the Army Times ran a story detailing proposed cuts to key military benefits, including family health care and on-base schools. These cuts would have sacrificed the living conditions of American troops while keeping funding constant for fighter and unmanned spy plane development and missile defense. Those plans were scrapped after a \u201cshock-and-awe\u201d display of military criticism, but Congress should still be wary of throwing new money into the Pentagon without making it clear that such misplaced priorities won\u2019t do.</span></p> <p><span>Higher salaries and better benefits would not be just a fulfillment of a campaign promise, though. They would also mitigate a threatening problem: As soldiers return from long tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan, the prospect of a huge drop in enlisted personnel is looming large. In the interest of regaining the trust of the military rank-and-file, retaining those currently in uniform and enlisting enough new recruits to replace those fed up with service abroad, it is essential that much of this new money be spent on benefits and enticements for new and returning soldiers, such as advertising, better pay and better living conditions.</span></p> <p><span>In a time when our military is being asked to take on complex peacekeeping and nation-building missions, the Bush administration cannot afford to shortchange American servicepeople. And lawmakers shouldn\u2019t give Bush the chance. House and Senate Republicans should show some uncharacteristic backbone and prevent the Bush administration from wasting this spending increase on Pentagon pet projects and hi-tech fighter programs that are for the most part useless in the fight against terror. Earmarking the money for salaries instead of fattening an already bloated weapons budget would make a bad budget a little bit better.</span></p>"}

John F. Kerry, D-Mass., appeared poised to win the election, while his opponents fought to secure coveted second and third-place finishes. The campaign of Gov. Howard B. Dean, hoping to rebound after a disappointing showing in Iowa last week, seemed particularly invested in tomorrow\u2019s results.</span></p> <p><span>Candidates flipped pancakes and stuck to their talking points at events across New Hampshire on Saturday and Sunday, while volunteers\u2014including scores of Harvard students\u2014waved signs and distributed materials for the various campaigns.</span></p> <p><span>Volunteers for each of the candidates remained under strict orders to avoid criticizing opponents, an indication that the amicable tone of Thursday night\u2019s debate was likely to extend through tomorrow\u2019s primary.</span></p> <p><span>Supporters of Sen. John R. Edwards, D-N.C., said the newly-positive tenor of his rivals was an affirmation of the senator\u2019s buoyant campaign style, which many pundits identified as the driving factor behind Edwards\u2019s surprising second-place finish in the Iowa caucuses.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cCynics didn\u2019t build this country. Optimists built this country,\u201d Edwards told the crowd at a Democratic Party fundraising dinner in Nashua Saturday night.</span></p> <p><span>His comments drew the evening\u2019s only standing ovation at an event in which six of the seven candidates delivered remarks.</span></p> <p><span>A pancake breakfast hosted by Gen. Wesley K. Clark in a firehouse garage in bucolic Auburn, N.H. Saturday morning filled the room beyond capacity. The fire marshal warned he might have to shut down the event for safety concerns.</span></p> <p><span>Clark, whose theme of a \u201chigher standard of leadership\u201d has marked his campaign since its inception in September, reiterated earlier remarks comparing his own military background to that of Kerry.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhen I came back from Vietnam, I stayed in the American Armed Forces.\u201d Clark told the crowd. \u201cI have executive experience. That\u2019s why I am the better candidate.\u201d The line echoed recent statements in which Clark has reminded voters that he was a general, while Kerry only was a lieutenant.</span></p> <p><span>Kerry addressed that Clark talking point in a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview broadcast on CBS last night.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s the first time I have heard the general be so dismissive of lieutenants, who bleed a lot in wars,\u201d Kerry said.</span></p> <p><span>A more jubilant crowd gathered to rally for Kerry on Saturday morning in Concord, N.H., where the Massachusetts senator appeared to have drawn significant support away from the Dean campaign.</span></p> <p><span>Kenneth J. Barnes \u201970, recalling his own days as a Harvard student campaigning for the doomed 1968 Eugene J. McCarthy campaign, said he once supported Dean but now planned to vote for Kerry.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe just hasn\u2019t been that impressive, even before the scream,\u201d Barnes said, referring to Dean\u2019s raucous\u2014and heavily criticized\u2014concession speech in Iowa Monday night.</span></p> <p><span>When asked what he would say to Harvard students considering a vote for a Yalie like himself, Kerry said, \u201cWe should focus on what unites us.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Kerry, Dean, and Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman\u2014along with President George W. Bush\u2014are all Yale graduates.</span></p> <p><span>Lieberman, D-Conn., has remained stagnant in New Hampshire, although the campaign pressed journalists over the weekend to acknowledge the Connecticut senator\u2019s slight uptick in most polls following his performance in Thursday night\u2019s debate.</span></p> <p><span>The most recent tracking poll by the American Research Group showed Lieberman with just 5 percent of the vote, while Kerry led with 38 percent. Clark, Dean and Edwards wrangled for the second position with 17, 16 and 15 percent, respectively.</span></p> <p><span>The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. Other tracking polls by Gallup and Zogby gave Kerry the lead but showed Dean in command of second place with more than 20 percent of the vote.</span></p> <p><span>At the Democratic fundraiser Saturday evening Clark more or less stuck to his standard stump speech, but also spoke more frankly than ever before about his previous political affiliations.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI have to tell you honestly, I haven\u2019t been a member of the Democratic Party for that long,\u201d said Clark, who has acknowledged previous votes for Richard M. Nixon and Ronald W. Reagan.</span></p> <p><span>The votes and the recency of his registration with the Democratic Party have dogged Clark in debates and on the campaign trail, and members of the Dean camp have recently accused Clark of being a Republican.</span></p> <p><span>But in a subdued address Saturday night, the former general attempted to display his Democratic colors.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe Democrats have got to take out the president,\u201d Clark said, speaking in his preferred military vernacular.</span></p> <p><span>Joshua S.

{"title": "Story Lines | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Americans need a narrative. Seeking patterns and repetition in history is rooted in the American tradition, ever since the Puritans sought to explain current events in terms of Biblical precedent. Known as typology, their method of reading history, literature and scripture reinforced the idea of divine providence by showing how current events were history in the making, repeating events from earlier, usually in the Bible. Fueled by this method of seeking precedent for everything, they came to see America as literally a new Israel. Finding moments in America\u2019s infant history that lined up with scriptural prophecy, the Puritans were able to create a narrative in which God himself smiled on their program.</span></p> <p><span>Now, the modern day prophets are up to the same thing, using the scripture of political legend to explain every twist and turn leading up to tomorrow\u2019s New Hampshire presidential primary. These days, pundits\u2019 obsessive use of history reminds one of sportscasters talking about the postseason: \u201conly one winner of the Iowa caucuses has actually gone on to become President,\u201d and \u201cthe candidate with the most money has won the nomination ever since 1970\u201d and \u201cthe average gain in national polls for the New Hampshire winner is 9% since 1988.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>It seems like our whole vocabulary for setting expectations is historically dependent. Is Gore sitting out 2004 so he can be like Nixon in 1968? Is Dean another McGovern in waiting? Just how much of a Bill Clinton can John Edwards be? Could Bush go the way of his father? My personal favorite is an emerging parlor game about whether this year could have a perfect storm of primaries that would return us to the days of Adlai Stevenson, when the party\u2019s nominee was not determined until the convention itself.</span></p> <p><span>Sometimes in politics, history really does seem to repeat itself, like last week when Republicans were caught digitally snooping in politically sensitive Democratic files on the Senate Judiciary Committee computer, in a digital-age version of Watergate. But the pervasive abuse of the suffix \u201c-gate\u201d to describe everything from Iran-Contra to Monica signals that our dependence on history to understand the present often outstretches its usefulness.</span></p> <p><span>Too often, the press acts prematurely in writing its proverbial \u201cfirst draft of history.\u201d Seeking to give current events the narrative clarity of a history book, journalists are quick to impose patterns and generalizations to help them tell a story. Often, the media adapt the facts to fit their narrative, rather than the other way around. Take the story of Al Gore\u2019s famous \u201cexaggerations,\u201d first reported in The New York Times and Washington Post. That strange beast, the press, had determined early on in 2000 that Gore\u2019s narrative would be about dishonesty. The story was perfect: Clinton lied, Gore lies. So, when he made three accurate claims about helping to fund the Internet, knowing the writer of the film \u201cLove Story\u201d and investigating a toxic disaster at Love Canal, the media exaggerated his claims, then wrote about how he exaggerates. The papers, not just misquoting him but doing so out of context, wrongly said he claimed to have invented the Internet, inspired \u201cLove Story\u201d and discovered Love Canal. The errors were eventually sorted out, but the damage was done. George W. Bush had some whoppers of his own at the time (like denying he had been arrested), but his \u201cstory\u201d was more about faith, Texas and incompetence, so the scandals never stuck.</span></p> <p><span>If a candidate has the misfortune of actually encouraging a pre-established, unfavorable narrative, it\u2019s all over. This happened to Michael Dukakis, whose calm answer to a hypothetical death-penalty question about his wife being raped became fodder for the running story that he was dull and dispassionate. (If you\u2019ve seen him speak at Harvard, as he often does, you probably were surprised at how different he seems from the Jon Lovitz caricature which helped to sink him.) On the opposite end of the spectrum, Howard Dean\u2019s perhaps-fatal mistake was not to behave badly in Iowa, but to do it in a way that plays into the type that the media had already chosen for him: the angry Dem. Strictly speaking, his speech was enthusiastic, not angry. But like a passage from scripture, that wild glint in his eye could be made to support any number of claims\u2014and the media\u2019s interpretation was ready and waiting before he even took the stage.</span></p> <p><span>One hopes that voters can act independently of the story handed to them, but lately they\u2019ve been conforming to their sources of information. Take Dean\u2019s precipitous fall in Iowa\u2014a surprise third-place finish which risks being overshadowed by his less important but more televisual \u201cI Have a Scream\u201d speech afterwards. Not to be conspiratorial, but his fall in the polls from a commanding lead to a depressing finish more or less followed the shift in the media\u2019s narrative, from the \u201cinevitable front-runner\u201d story running this summer and fall to the winter of doubt, characterized by a mountain of negative news, including the cover stories of both Time and Newsweek in the same week of January: \u201cDoubts About Dean\u201d and \u201cWho Is the Real Dean?\u201d Dean\u2019s plummet followed close behind. If John Kerry pulls out a victory in New Hampshire, part of it will be because the press hasn\u2019t gotten around to developing a negative narrative for him. As long as the events can outpace the media\u2019s ability to construct a novelistic story around them, the voters may have some control; but it doesn\u2019t take long to spin a tale.</span></p> <p><span>What no one seems able to explain is why some narratives are chosen, and others aren\u2019t. The stories of JFK and George W. could have been told in terms of privilege and wealth, but instead their narratives were about the charming senator and the down-home governor. Even now, events in one area are writing themselves into a pattern any historian or journalist should admire: the White House\u2019s repeated dismissal of our own intelligence community. On Aug. 6, 2001, Bush received warnings about a possible al Qaeda attack in the U.S. and took a vacation. When the CIA objected to the inclusion of a false claim about Saddam buying uranium, it was ignored. Thursday, newspapers reported that CIA officials believe Iraq may be careening towards civil war.

Kerry for President | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>As the voters of New Hampshire brave the snow to go to the polls tomorrow, we encourage them to cast their ballots for the candidate in this Democratic Primary who is best prepared to put an end to the damage done by the Bush administration, restore America as a nation of promise and opportunity and return it to its place as leader among nations. We are proud to endorse Senator John F. Kerry for president.</span></p> <p><span>In a strong field of candidates, Kerry stands above the others for his thoughtful grasp of America\u2019s most challenging domestic concerns, his years of experience advocating sensible and nuanced foreign policy, his principled stances on military issues and his willingness to forge consensus among those on both sides of the aisle.</span></p> <p><span>It goes without saying that Kerry\u2019s personal biography is compelling. His experience as a veteran ensures that his decisions about America\u2019s sons and daughters will be made with a perspective and thoughtfulness that few other candidates bring to the table. But more than his Purple Hearts for valor in combat and the life-and-death decisions he made to lead his men home safely, it is the passionate conviction he showed in protesting the Vietnam War on his return that proves the mettle of his character. John Kerry understands deeply what happens when an administration abuses the public\u2019s trust in order to pursue its own agenda, which is why we are confident that he has the courage to restore accountability to the White House.</span></p> <p><span>We believe in Kerry\u2019s ability to clean up the mess that has been made of the Iraqi reconstruction efforts, by internationalizing the operations and marshaling the United Nation\u2019s resources and goodwill in the region. His thoughtfulness about the decisions facing the U.S. in Iraq\u2014and his resistance against boiling his philosophy down to a sound bite\u2014is an encouraging harbinger of his ability to stand up to the ideologues who see America\u2019s predominance as a tool for bludgeoning rather than inspiring. Kerry\u2019s 18 years on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has given him the context and confidence to enact a multilateral foreign policy.</span></p> <p><span>Equally attractive is Kerry\u2019s stance on domestic and economic issues. While the Karl Roves will surely try to paint Kerry as a \u2018tax-and-spend liberal,\u2019 his record in the Senate, and his plan for a tax policy that keeps costs low for working families, shows that he understands the pressures that face America\u2019s middle class more than any other candidate in the race. Repealing Bush\u2019s tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans is a necessary and progressive step towards fiscal responsibility; keeping them in place for the middle class is sensible and compassionate policy. Kerry\u2019s health care plan  extends coverage to millions more Americans without outsourcing America\u2019s healthcare protections or bankrupting its future economic stability.</span></p> <p><span>John Kerry has proven himself a dogged fighter, not just in his recent come-from-behind victory in Iowa\u2014which illustrated his broad appeal to voters in America\u2019s heartland\u2014but also in his legislative record. The four-term senator has nearly single-handedly kept the nation\u2019s environmental health on the radar screen\u2014long before issues like the Atlantic National Wildlife Refuge were fashionable causes. And he is the only candidate with the foresight and expertise to put forth a comprehensive plan for energy independence from foreign oil.</span></p> <p><span>Kerry\u2019s message has the broadest appeal and will be the strongest in the general election, but the Bush-Cheney machine will be a formidable opponent for Kerry, whose campaign is not as glitzy as some others in the race. In order to continue the momentum his campaign has built, Kerry should look to some of his southern colleagues as possible running mates in order to create the geographic diversity that has been crucial for other Democratic tickets.</span></p> <p><span>Kerry will need to stay strong as his campaign moves forward and he comes under the harsh scrutiny earned by his front-runner status. He will need to look above the minute-by-minute pontificating by pollsters and pundits. But this is a task he is ready to undertake. As Kerry himself explained to a reporter pestering about his tracking numbers on the day before the Iowa caucuses, \u201cThe polls aren\u2019t what this is about\u2026It\u2019s about issues, it\u2019s about people, it\u2019s about people\u2019s concerns. And as we go around this country and point out, the millions of children left behind, the education system in disarray, the health care system imploding on itself\u2026When people look at an energy bill with $50 billion of oil and gas subsidies, instead of investing in alternative and renewable energy, and fighting for energy independence. We\u2019re not setting, under this administration, the real agenda of our nation. And I will, and when that agenda is clearly defined to the country, you watch.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>We look forward to watching Kerry take the lead, take his message to the American people and take back the White House. We are proud to endorse him for president.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Disappearing Corruption | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>On Dec. 10, 2003, soft money took its rightful place beside libel, obscenity and false advertising as a form of speech prohibited in the name of the public good. In a surprise decision, the Supreme Court upheld nearly all the major provisions of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA)\u2014including a ban on unlimited donations to political parties, known as soft money, and new laws regulating television advertising bought on behalf of candidates by their corporate and union supporters.</span></p> <p><span>BCRA\u2019s opponents had claimed that banning soft money and restricting advertising was tantamount to limiting the right to free speech of corporations, unions and special interest groups. In rejecting this argument, the Supreme Court declared, in effect, that the importance of protecting of these means of speech was outweighed by the need to prevent the appearance of corruption in politics. The Court was right to make the  reduction of apparent corruption a primary concern. In a country where the more monied candidates win 90 percent of the elections, the influence of wealthy donors cannot be denied. The Framers certainly would not have wanted political parties catering to the blank checks of special interests.</span></p> <p><span>At the heart of campaign finance reform is the notion that the rich shouldn\u2019t be allowed to unduly influence politics. The appearance of this undue influence\u2014real or imagined\u2014was widespread before the signing of the BCRA. Companies gave most to the very politicians who sat on the committees charged with regulating them. And they spent heavily on the campaigns of their strongest political advocates. Sen. Richard C. Shelby, R-Ala., a recipient of over $74,000 of auto industry donations from 1995 to 2000, led the fight against new rollover potential ratings for SUVs: a cause he dropped only after the Firestone-Ford debacle brought rollover tragedies to the forefront. When the House was still considering whether to fund the Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit against the tobacco companies in 2000, the 207 House members who voted to block this funding received an average of five times more money from the tobacco companies in the last two election cycles than those who voted for the funding. These kinds of examples, where only a few dots need be connected to infer political corruption, are what the BCRA and campaign finance reform in general will stop for good.</span></p> <p><span>By accepting the main provisions of the BCRA, the Court established a strong, lasting precedent in favor of the practical consideration of reducing the appearance of corruption. With politicians now forced to rely on small, maximum $2,000 donations called hard money, the $200 check written by an autoworker or a dry-cleaner carries more meaning than ever. With BCRA regulations in effect, the most successful fundraisers will win the distinction with the sheer number of donations they solicit, not with the buying power of a few wealthy executives. With so many voices behind a candidate\u2019s campaign, the politician is more likely to cater to the public interest, instead of a few special ones.</span></p> <p><span>Building on this victory, congressional supporters of campaign finance reform have introduced two other significant measures to fix additional problems with the system. The first seeks to shore up public funding for presidential campaigns, which provides candidates with matching public funds if they adopt voluntary spending limits. The current upper bound to these funds is too low\u2014a fact illustrated by George W. Bush\u2019s, Howard Dean\u2019s and Sen. John F. Kerry\u2019s decisions to forego federal funds in their primaries. This proposal is a necessary outgrowth of the BCRA, since it will encourage the adoption of spending limits and reduce further candidates\u2019 exposure to special interest money. The second proposal, a bill introduced by Sen. John S. McCain, R-Ariz., to reorganize the Federal Elections Commission (FEC), which is tasked with enforcing campaign finance laws, also deserves congressional support. The FEC must be given greater authority and legitimacy to implement these new laws. With campaign finance-related investigations already launching, including one against House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the FEC needs clout and power to make campaign finance reform the unchallenged law of the new political landscape. Additional measures like these will guarantee that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision truly transfers power from the special interests back to the American voters, where it belongs.</span></p>"}

Massachusetts Department of Public Health decision\u2014in which the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court declared in-state bans on same-sex marriage unconstitutional\u2014are allowed to stand, Bush warned, \u201cthe only alternative left to the people would be the constitutional process.\u201d While the president did not go so far as to endorse the proposed federal constitutional amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage, he indicated that he saw such a move as a reasonable and even inevitable course of action. This may be the most significant presidential pronouncement on the subject of gay rights since Bill Clinton rolled out \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d in 1993. And yet President Bush called for a nationwide doctrine of discrimination without even using the words \u201cgay\u201d or \u201clesbian\u201d in his address.</span></p> <p><span>Bush tries to avoid these words because the cheery meme of compassionate conservatism depends on affirmative language\u2014speeches about what marriage should be rather than what it shouldn\u2019t. Imagine Bush posing for a photo-op with Mary Cheney, only to have her turn to him in front of the cameras and ask if he thinks that she and her longtime partner should be able to marry. Such a confrontation would surely leave Bush stammering and red-faced, because it\u2019s far easier for him to say a dehumanized \u201cno\u201d to gay America than a face-to-face \u201cno\u201d to one gay American. It\u2019s easier to describe the Defense of Marriage Act as one more way to strengthen marriages, as if two men tying the knot in Boston somehow weakens the conjugal bonds of a straight couple in Dallas. And it will be easier to call a new doctrine of discrimination the Federal Marriage Amendment, though the Historically Unprecedented Hijacking of the Constitution to Single Out a Group of American Citizens and Explicitly Deny Them Certain Rights Amendment might be more apt. (Perhaps the perennially forthright Attorney General John Ashcroft initially favored the latter title, but was told by the Justice Department that the acronym would be too unwieldy.)</span></p> <p><span>The sop that Bush tried to throw gays and lesbians in his State of the Union Address may be most insulting of all. The same moral tradition that excludes us from marriage, Bush explained, \u201calso teaches that each individual has dignity and value in God\u2019s sight.\u201d Even though our community would profane the sanctity of marriage, apparently we can still hold our heads high because we have dignity and value. Here\u2019s a news flash, Mr. President: Treating us with dignity and value would mean using the words \u201cgay\u201d and \u201clesbian\u201d in your State of the Union Address. If you are bent on disenfranchising us, then the least you can do is to speak our names out loud as you make us into second-class citizens.</span></p> <p><span>Tell us, Mr. President, what do people of dignity and value deserve in this great nation that you have the privilege of leading? The right to visit a loved one in intensive care? The right to vouch for a loved one\u2019s green card? The right to jointly adopt children in the eyes of the law? Or how about the right to have our state or commonwealth bear witness to our love for each other, instead of pathologizing it and sweeping it under the rug? We have listened to your vague ideas about dignity and value, and, frankly, we have found them sorely wanting.</span></p> <p><span><i>Marcel A.Q.

Hemel", "body": "<p><span>The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s ruling in support of gay marriage drew sharp criticism from Harvard Law School professors at a panel discussion yesterday afternoon.</span></p> <p><span>The court\u2019s ruling\u2014issued in November and reaffirmed in a message to the state Senate on Wednesday\u2014evinced \u201cself-intoxicating narcissism and arrogance right on the surface,\u201d said Williams Professor of Criminal Justice Richard D. Parker.</span></p> <p><span>Before an audience of more than 200 in Austen Hall, Parker said the ruling in the case Goodridge v. Department of Public Health was \u201cas sloppy of an opinion as you could want to read.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Tyler Professor of Constitutional Law Laurence H. Tribe \u201962 responded with a passionate defense of the opinion, calling it a \u201cmasterpiece.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Tribe last month authored a friend-of-the-court brief, signed by 18 professors from Harvard Law School, encouraging Massachusetts judges to explicitly support same-sex marriage, rather than civil unions.</span></p> <p><span>But Tribe found himself in a minority of one as Professor of Law Janet Halley and Assistant Professor of Law David J. Barron \u201989 joined the chorus criticizing the court\u2019s decision.</span></p> <p><span>Parker argued that the court\u2019s decision subverted democratic processes.</span></p> <p><span>He predicted a popular backlash and said that judges ought to face consequences as a result of their arrogance.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe price should be a change in the constitution of the state so that judges have to be elected\u2014or at least they should be term-limited,\u201d Parker said.</span></p> <p><span>He said the court should have taken a more \u201cgradualist\u201d approach, allowing the state legislature to institute civil unions instead of gay marriage.</span></p> <p><span>According to Parker, if the court had pursued a civil union approach, voters would have slowly come around to accept gay marriage.</span></p> <p><span>He predicted that a pro-gay marriage majority would likely have emerged in Massachusetts within a decade.</span></p> <p><span>All four professors mulled the political implications of the ruling. Parker said that the focus on gay marriage could push Senator John F. Kerry, D-Mass., into a corner.</span></p> <p><span>Kerry, the frontrunner for his party\u2019s presidential nomination, issued a statement on Wednesday reiterating his support for civil unions but opposing gay marriage.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI don\u2019t think Kerry is going to let Bush\u2014as a rhetorical matter\u2014be less against [gay marriage] than he is,\u201d Parker said.</span></p> <p><span>Tribe said that Kerry could seek to avoid discussing gay marriage by focusing attention on economic issues. But this is a taller order now that the issue is emanating from Kerry\u2019s home state.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf I were one of Bush\u2019s people right now, I would force Kerry into saying whether he supports a state constitutional amendment [reversing the court\u2019s ruling],\u201d Parker said.</span></p> <p><span>According to Tribe, 37 states have passed laws barring recognition of same-sex marriages, and Ohio Gov. Bob Taft could soon make his state the 38th.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThirty-eight is a magic number because it\u2019s the smallest integer that is more than three quarters of 50,\u201d Tribe said, in reference to the number of states needed to amend the U.S. Constitution.</span></p> <p><span>By holding state-wide referenda on gay marriage, Republicans can motivate their socially conservative constituents to flock to the polls, Tribe said.</span></p> <p><span>But changing the Massachusetts constitution would be a trickier task.</span></p> <p><span>According to Barron, who is a former Crimson president, an amendment to the state constitution could not be passed until 2006.</span></p> <p><span>Barron criticized the Massachusetts court\u2019s emphasis on federal rather than state constitutional precedents.</span></p> <p><span>He said the decision fails to recognize Massachusetts as a unique political entity.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere\u2019s no mention of the demographics of Massachusetts. There\u2019s no mention of the fact that Massachusetts has a large Catholic population, or the fact that it has a large gay population,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt was a mistake to highlight so prominently the federal constitutional case law,\u201d Barron concluded.</span></p> <p><span>The court\u2019s November decision echoed the language of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Brown v. Board of Education decision of May 17, 1954, which barred segregation in schools.</span></p> <p><span>The Massachusetts court\u2019s decision stayed its ruling for 180 days\u2014until May 17.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI have wondered if it was a conscious decision that the stay would run out on the 50th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education,\u201d Tribe said.</span></p> <p><span><b> Strange Bedfellows </b></span></p> <p><span>Barron and Halley also criticized the judges for ignoring some of the sociological effects of their decision.</span></p> <p><span>The judges who authored the majority and concurring opinions \u201carticulated a socially conservative vision of marriage as the foundation of the social order,\u201d Halley said.</span></p> <p><span>The ruling marks an emerging trend of gay rights advocates reifying marriage\u2014and devaluing less formal domestic partnerships, according to Halley.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe gay centrist and social conservative formulations are overlapping more and more,\u201d Halley said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe could have some really interesting sex politics now,\u201d she added.</span></p> <p><span>Tribe conceded that the court\u2019s ruling creates a plethora of legal anomolies.</span></p> <p><span>While Massachusetts currently prohibits marriage between brother and sister, state law might have to be amended to bar unions between siblings of the same sex as well.</span></p> <p><span>But Tribe noted that judges could potentially rule that their decision in the Goodridge case renders other marriage laws gender neutral as well.</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff Writer Daniel J.

Form letters are nothing unusual, but this clever cyber writing tool allows you to include your own selection of pre-approved \u201ctalking points\u201d using the point-and-click method. If you want to include the line \u201cPresident Bush should be commended for his strong leadership on the economy,\u201d you click a green check mark beside the paragraph; if you want to forgo the point \u201cPresident Bush understands that we must save Social Security for seniors and for generations to come,\u201d click the red X to delete it. You hardly have to think at all\u2014just the way the GOP campaign machine likes it.</span></p> <p><span>The site even streamlines the mailing process, providing a comprehensive list of local newspapers, and their contact information, according to the zip code you input. Simply check a few boxes, fill in your contact info, and the website prints out a perfectly prepared personal letter with your very own name on it\u2014written by a Bush-Cheney campaign staffer. All you have to do is print, put a stamp on the envelope and mail it off. Or, if you are obscenely lazy, the site will even e-mail the letter for you. The whole process takes literally seconds, cunningly facilitating the Bush camp\u2019s dissemination of its finely-tuned talking points through the guise of average Americans. According to a January New York Times report, over 37,000 such e-mail messages have already been sent to newspaper editors.</span></p> <p><span>The letters are disingenuous and deceptive\u2014but they could easily be dismissed, if only they were an isolated affair. Instead, they reflect a far broader, more disturbing trend. They are blatant attempts to manipulate editorial pages and fill them with campaign propaganda misrepresented as personal views. The entire operation smacks of utter disrespect for the role of journalism and uninhibited debate within a free society. It parallels the Bush administration\u2019s general approach to the media, which includes a sense of entitlement and contempt\u2014an attitude which is echoed regularly in the White House\u2019s theatrical misinformation campaigns and denunciations of \u201cunpatriotic\u201d dissent.</span></p> <p><span>Ken Auletta\u2019s recent article in the New Yorker, detailing the Bush administration\u2019s peculiar relationship with the press, draws much the same conclusion. Rejecting common notions of the venerable fourth estate operating on people\u2019s behalf to check government power, the White House views the media as a self-serving special interest. While there are certainly valid reasons to distrust the press\u2014especially its contemporary profit-driven variations\u2014the Bush White House seems to believe that an ideal press should serve as a mouthpiece for its pre-packaged sound bites, and that anything less is a profiteering scheme.</span></p> <p><span>In an October effort to punish those network media outlets perceived as straying too far from the administration\u2019s message (i.e., covering the lack of progress in Iraq), Bush courted regional media sources. At the time, the Washington Post cited media analysts who speculated the move amounted to \u201cshopping for softer questioning.\u201d Dan Bartlett, the White House communications director, admitted to the Post that the Bush administration did in fact view local media and regional broadcasts as \u201cless analytical and more reporting,\u201d but the emphasis on unsophisticated, uncomplicated regurgitation of presidential talking points was touted as a virtue, not a vice.</span></p> <p><span>The White House, through the skillful planning of political mastermind Karl Rove, has also learned to exploit the news media\u2019s reliance on dramatic spectacle for its own special interests. Bush\u2019s covert Thanksgiving Day stopover at the Baghdad airport for two and a half hours was a particularly fitting example. Encircled by soldiers, the president smiled widely for the cameras, carrying a huge platter with a giant golden-brown turkey, lavish trimmings and bunches of grapes. The image was plastered on practically every online site, television broadcast and newspaper front page, helping to amplify optimism about the deteriorating state of affairs in Iraq.</span></p> <p><span>The event turned out to be meticulously choreographed to a devious degree. The White House eventually acknowledged that the plentiful platter Bush carried was a table decoration\u2014not for actual consumption. And a thrilling anecdote about a passing pilot who nearly blew Air Force One\u2019s cover\u2014while it posed as a much smaller plane in order to slip through British airspace\u2014was mysteriously unverifiable, if not wholly fabricated.</span></p> <p><span>Bush\u2019s handlers have proven themselves extraordinarily deft at managing the media, but that revelation is old news. With budget deficits soaring at an alarming rate, the prospect of Iraqi democracy becoming ever more uncertain and Bush now submitting to bipartisan calls for a potentially devastating intelligence review, another Rove-conceived media stunt is undoubtedly waiting in the wings. And it will likely give Bush the boost he seeks.</span></p> <p><span>What is far more surprising is the extent to which Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld actually seem to believe in the fantasies they peddle. Auletta quotes Bush as boasting, \u201cNo president has ever done more for human rights than I have.\u201d In fact, no president has persisted for so long with his fingers in his ears. It has been well-publicized that Bush distrusts most media sources and instead receives his information from close (and biased) advisers. It is no wonder then that Bush remains so out of touch with reality\u2014and so willing to dismiss the many critics who raise valid concerns domestically and abroad. With any luck, voters will send him a message that hits a lot harder than an electronic political Mad Lib this November.</span></p> <p><span><i>Benjamin J.

Almost every single one of Palmer\u2019s guests espouses the same model for making a difference in a world where the popularity of people who disagree with them is evidently troubling: hysteria-generating, far-left activism.</span></p> <p><span>Global transformers this spring include, according to Palmer\u2019s description, \u201crenowned historian Howard Zinn,\u201d who is mostly renowned for his socialist screed A People\u2019s History of the United States. MIT professor Noam Chomsky, euphemistically described by Palmer as a \u201csocial critic,\u201d compared President Bush\u2019s counter-terrorism efforts to Nazism.

Indeed, it seems that not enough vacuous and fawning praise can be heaped upon Idealism 101, as it is stroked in a single Harvard Gazette profile as \u201ca way of having richer discussion,\u201d \u201ccreating a caring community,\u201d \u201c[helping students] envision what they could become,\u201d and helping to \u201cbring about a more humane, peaceful world.\u201d Naturally, guest speakers were admired for their \u201cextraordinary courage.\u201d Said Palmer: \u201c[Students] told me it was this kind of discussion that they came to university for, that education was this.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>These meaningless accolades may make everyone feel good, but they prove absolutely nothing\u2014least of all that the class is balanced or sane.

But it wasn\u2019t so much who the performers were as what they were doing that had Dartboard disbelieving his own eyes.  And Dartboard doesn\u2019t mean the famous undressing.  (A much-celebrated moment that he missed and that never would have corrupted him if the media were not secretly obsessed with sex.)</span></p> <p><span>No, it didn\u2019t take nudity to set off Dartboard\u2019s indecency radar.  The animal impulses that seemed to overcome the halftime entertainers all along were strangely familiar.  Dartboard had last seen them in party-hosting dorm rooms filled with booze and pheromones.  Astoundingly, viewers are meant to believe that this licentious behavior\u2014nudity notwithstanding\u2014is as all-American as the football it interrupts.  At the very least, the FCC would have Dartboard think such a display more acceptable than saying one of George Carlin\u2019s seven dirty words on television.  But Dartboard knows better and will be sure to avoid the Super Bowl once he has kids, so as to protect them from the soft-core porn that now pervades primetime sports, courtesy of MTV.  After learning that Jackson had revealed a breast, Dartboard saw no reason for surprise: with the tomfoolery that was allowed to go on on that dance floor, the networks were asking for it.</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014DANIEL B.

{"title": "Bush\u2019s Trap Door for Immigrants | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The way President Bush has been talking lately, one might almost mistake him for someone who comprehends the fundamental role open borders play in an open society. \u201cOver the generations, we have received energetic, ambitious, optimistic people from every part of the world,\u201d Bush said early last month. \u201cEvery generation of immigrants has reaffirmed the wisdom of remaining open to the talents and dreams of the world.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>It\u2019s always a pleasant surprise to hear that kind of mainstream liberal rhetoric coming from a staunch conservative like Bush. But the taste of free opportunity soured somewhat as the president\u2019s next words\u2014outlining a vague but far-reaching plan for reforming federal immigration law\u2014completely undermined the ideals to which he had paid half-hearted lip service.</span></p> <p><span>On the surface, Bush\u2019s proposal seems to offer the America\u2019s constantly-growing population of illegal immigrants the fair shake they deserve by making eight million of them legal temporary workers. No more would these people\u2014many of whom have held low-paying menial jobs for years\u2014contribute to America\u2019s service economy without reaping its benefits. Those who work in the United States should never have to avoid hospitals or jobs with reasonable safety controls for fear of being deported.</span></p> <p><span>But there is fine print. If the president has his way, these new workers won\u2019t just get temporary green cards\u2014they\u2019ll be enticed by personal retirement funds set up for them courtesy of Dubya\u2019s Congress. The only catch? The funds wouldn\u2019t be accessible until the workers left the United States. Just as he invites immigrants to join America\u2019s legal workforce, Bush would introduce hamhanded bribes to push them back out again. What\u2019s more, an illegal worker who volunteered to join the new program wouldn\u2019t be guaranteed to get one of the eight million new green cards being offered, raising the distinctly underhanded prospect of immigrants being deported just for trying to become legal. And Bush\u2019s offer of temporary worker status would come with an absolute expiration date\u2014after just six years of making America work without violating its laws, the immigrants would be unable to renew their legal status.</span></p> <p><span>Even if Bush\u2019s plan came with no tricks or time limits, though, it wouldn\u2019t be nearly enough. Instead of kicking these temporary workers out after six years, the United States should enact a complete amnesty for all illegal immigrants currently in the country. This should also be coupled with significant increases in the quotas that still stand on those seeking entry. America did not become great by locking its doors, and those after their own small slice of the lone global superpower\u2019s fiscal pie should not be forced to sneak in by covert and often dangerous routes.</span></p> <p><span>Our country\u2019s centuries of progress and prosperity have been built on the backs of immigrants. Everyone\u2014including President Bush these days\u2014is quick to acknowledge the tremendous contribution of the millions who came through Ellis Island legally in the past. If Bush is serious about changing the profoundly unfair status quo, he owes it to the American people to scrap his torturous proposal and do something that will actually solve the problem.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Blocking Bigotry All Over Again | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>For a while, it seemed as though Massachusetts Gov. W. Mitt Romney would stop at nothing to deny homosexuals in the Commonwealth the right to marry. After the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) deemed same-sex marriage a constitutional right in this state in November, Romney sought to keep marriage a strictly heterosexual institution, offering same-sex couples instead the right to join in \u201ccivil unions,\u201d which would grant many of the benefits of marriage without the title. But Romney\u2019s efforts\u2014which were little more than a petty, underhanded attempt to stall for time\u2014were thwarted yesterday, when the SJC ruled that civil unions just wouldn\u2019t cut it.</span></p> <p><span>Now Romney and anti-gay activists only have one way to stop gay marriage in Massachusetts: a constitutional amendment. Though the state legislature is scheduled to vote on such an amendment in a little less than a week, opponents of same-sex marriage should realize that it\u2019s time to give up their long-outdated fight.</span></p> <p><span>The arguments for and against gay marriage are surely familiar to nearly all by now. Those who oppose it insist that gay marriage is corrosive of family values and that homosexuals are deviants unsuited to raise children. Those of us who favor gay marriage are constantly repeating the obvious to counter such backward claims\u2014that homosexuality is not intrinsically wrong and that if we want to strengthen families, the last thing we should do is deprive citizens of an institution that can facilitate strong family bonds. Indeed, it is sad that we have to continue fighting the same kind of flawed, regressive logic that social conservatives have used for centuries to deprive whole sections of the population of fundamental rights\u2014from opponents of interracial marriage and the Civil Rights Act 40 years ago to foes of women\u2019s suffrage 85 years ago. The reactionaries were wrong then, and they are wrong now.</span></p> <p><span>But we expect that Romney and his cohorts, too, will find these arguments familiar\u2014and too easy to brush off. So it is up to the state legislature to stop the proposed amendment, for the sake of much more than Massachusetts\u2019s gay community. Now that President Bush seems set on an amendment to the U.S. Constitution banning same-sex marriage, the legislature has the opportunity to set an important precedent for gay people across the nation\u2014by rejecting the bigoted arguments of anti-gay activists.</span></p> <p><span>Throughout this country\u2019s history, great leaps of social progress, from emancipation to the women\u2019s suffrage and civil rights movements, have almost always been achieved through the enfranchisement of those who have traditionally been oppressed. Surely, an amendment banning gay marriage  in Massachusetts would be a significant step backward, both for the state and the nation as a whole.</span></p>"}
