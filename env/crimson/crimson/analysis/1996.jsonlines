{"title": "IOP FELLOWS SPRING INTO ACTION | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Edwin Rogers is happy to be hitting the books.</span></p> <p><span>Rogers, one of this semester's six new Institute of Politics (IOP) Fellows, is auditing Foreign Cultures 14, \"Society and Politics in India.\"</span></p> <p><span>But, as a former Capitol Hill lobbyist for India, it is only natural that she would be fascinated by the subject matter.</span></p> <p><span>The IOP Fellows Program, founded in 1967, helps to bring experienced politicians, policy makers, journalists and philanthropists to the Kennedy School of Government for one semester.</span></p> <p><span>While at Harvard, the fellows teach study groups at the IOP, take classes, meet with students and undertake \"independent study and reflection,\" according to Theresa Donovan, the program's director.</span></p> <p><span>\"I think it [the IOP Fellowship Program] is just the greatest,\" Rogers says.  \"It brings in practitioners with real world experience and has them available to talk to students any time.\"</span></p> <p><span>But, while the fellows are permitted to audit as many courses as they wish, their primary responsibility is to lead IOP study groups, Donovan says.</span></p> <p><span>And, she adds, the guidelines for the program ensure that the fellows offer liberal office hours, and maintain an \"open door policy.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Our primary audience is one of undergraduate students,\" Donovan says.</span></p> <p><span>This semester's fellows are Rogers; Carl Anthony, director of the Urban Habitat Program; former Senator Wyche Fowler, Jr. (D-Geo.); Leslie Goodman, who has served as deputy chief of communications under California Gov. Pete Wilson; Bruce Herschensohn, the GOP nominee for a 1992 California Senate race and Lynn R. Williams, former president of United Steelworkers of America.</span></p> <p><span>Kathryn Whitmire, mayor of Houston from 1982-92, is serving her second term as an IOP fellow.</span></p> <p><span><b>From Alexander to Simon</b></span></p> <p><span>This semester's seven fellows are participants in an institution dating back to the IOP's foundation in 1966.</span></p> <p><span>Former Harvard President Nathan M. Pusey '28 articulated the mission of the proposed program at a 1964 press conference at the Kennedy Library, according to a newsletter published by the IOP.</span></p> <p><span>\"What we have in mind is the establishing of a new kind of institution in American life within a university setting, which will furnish a meeting place for scholars and for individuals pursuing careers in practical politics and public service,\" Pusey said.</span></p> <p><span>The first group of IOP Fellows included ten individuals, nominated in 1967.  Since then, 300 people have served as IOP Fellows, representing a spectrum as diverse as American politics.</span></p> <p><span>Geraldine Ferraro, Betty Friedan, David R. Gergen, Al Gore '69, Vernon E. Jordan, Jr. and Paul Simon have all been IOP Fellows.</span></p> <p><span><b>The Selection Process</b></span></p> <p><span>Currently, the IOP chooses six individuals as fellows each semester.  According to Donovan, IOP leaders nominate candidates for the program with the aid of input from students and faculty.</span></p> <p><span>The criteria used to select the fellows include political experience, past leadership roles and an interest in interacting with students and faculty, Donovan says.</span></p> <p><span>She adds that the program particularly seems to attract individuals who are at a point in their careers where they may benefit from a sabbatical away from their activities.</span></p> <p><span>\"The idea of the program is to capture 'in and outers'--people who have served government, and then are taking a break, who will go back into government,\" Donovan says.  \"We want to have people who have had experience in government, and that is when you get them, when there are transitions in government.\"</span></p> <p><span>Whitmire came to the Institute as a fellow for the 1995 fall semester, after serving as mayor of Houston for ten years.</span></p> <p><span>According to Donovan, the fellowship is more often a transition than an endpoint in the political careers of the participants.  She notes that many past fellows have returned to successful political careers.</span></p> <p><span>Ronald H. Brown and Richard Riley both served as IOP Fellows, before accepting positions in the Clinton Cabinet.  Lamar Alexander, a Republican presidential candidate this year, was a fellow at the Institute in 1971.</span></p> <p><span>While most fellows serve for one semester, a few have stayed on to take teaching positions at Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>Whitmire, a fall fellow, will spend the spring semester at the Kennedy School.  She is teaching a class entitled, \"Women in Politics:  Policy, Advocacy and Leadership.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"I didn't want to leave after just one semester,\" she says.</span></p> <p><span><b>Back to School</b></span></p> <p><span>Each IOP Fellow will lead a study group on topics ranging from political reform in the Republican Congress, to the interaction of science and public policy.  The study groups are open to undergraduates and members of the Cambridge community.</span></p> <p><span>In addition to teaching the study groups, the fellows have made a variety of plans for their semester at Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>Both Williams and his wife hope to take courses in their areas of interest at the College.</span></p> <p><span>\"I just went through the course catalog and ticked off everything we were interested in,\" Williams says.  \"I have written down two pages of classes I want to take.\"</span></p> <p><span>They will both be auditing Moral Reasoning 52, \"Property Rights:  Morals and Law,\" Williams says.</span></p> <p><span>Williams adds that he hopes to \"revive\" his love of jazz music and theater during his time in Harvard.  \"I'm just exhausted listening to all the opportunities available here,\" he says.</span></p> <p><span>Fowler says that he would like to explore his interests in Biblical archaeology and English literature, and would enjoy talking with students about those topics.</span></p> <p><span>It is the interaction with students that the fellows cite as their primary motivation in participating in the fellowship program.</span></p> <p><span>\"I jumped at the opportunity to be able to spend a semester in discussion with students, and an opportunity to do some independent reading, study and reflection on my own,\" Fowler says.  \"It's an opportunity that very few people have.\"</span></p> <p><span>Many of the fellows express their hope that they would be able to aid students through sharing their political experiences.</span></p> <p><span>Whitmire says she believes she has much to offer in leadership advice, and is eager to share her experiences as the mayor of a major American city.</span></p> <p><span>\"You have to believe in a cause or you can't be a good leader for that cause,\" she says.</span></p> <p><span>Whitmire adds that she hopes to share her experiences in broadcast journalism with students, saying that she believes \"that the media has a very important role in the development of public policy, and that role is education.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"I want to try to explore this issue [with students] while I am here,\" she says.</span></p> <p><span>Herschensohn says that he would be interested in discussing issues pertaining to the flat tax rate with students.  Having traveled to over 90 countries, he says he is also eager to share his experiences in foreign affairs.</span></p> <p><span>He adds that he has worked for the Nixon administration, and could share his knowledge on the Nixon years as well.</span></p> <p><span>\"I could also talk about running for office,\" Herschensohn says, referring to his campaign for the Senate from his home state of California.</span></p> <p><span>Fowler, who served in the House of Representatives from 1976-86 and in the U.S. Senate from 1986-92, and has held elected office for 26 years, says that he would like to share his interests in public service and government with students.</span></p> <p><span>Fowler notes that he is still playing an active role in U.S. government.  He currently serves on the President's Commission on the Roles and Responsibilities of the Intelligence Community, which is \"re-evaluating the mission and responsibilities of the intelligence in the US,\" he says.</span></p> <p><span>\"I hope that I can help the mission of the Kennedy School and the IOP, which is to inspire a love of public service into students at the earliest possibility; I know that I will learn much from the fellows and students here,\" Fowler adds.</span></p> <p><span>Many of the fellows say they hope to encourage students to become actively involved in the political process.</span></p> <p><span>\"I would have loved to have had a program like this [in college], because politics touches everybody, and even if you have no interest in running for public office, there are so many other ways to get involved and to control the outcome in certain situations,\" Rogers says.</span></p> <p><span>It is an opportunity \"that they [students] may never get again in life, to just walk in the doorway and talk to someone whose an expert,\" Herschensohn says.</span></p> <p><span>In fact, encouraging undergraduate students to benefit from and make use of the fellows program is one of the primary goals of the IOP, according to Donovan.</span></p> <p><span><b>Learning from Each Other</b></span></p> <p><span>The IOP Fellows this semester say that they especially look forward to the chance they will have to spend time as members of the Harvard community.</span></p> <p><span>\"It's a marvelous opportunity, I think, for the students, and also for the fellows themselves,\" says Herschensohn.</span></p> <p><span>Herschensohn also adds that he feels a semester spent with students could help to broaden a politician's view of the world.</span></p> <p><span>\"Sometimes you lose perspective,\" he says.  \"You get so lost in the things that you are doing on a day to day basis that you don't see them in context with other generations, and the bigger picture.\"</span></p>"}

Spivack Award for his book.</span></p> <p><span><b>The Charismatic Professor</b></span></p> <p><span>In contrast to the academic sparks that fly from his work, Wilson, who is also teaching in the Afro-Am department this year, is \"quietly charismatic,\" according to Gates.</span></p> <p><span>\"His demeanor reflects the quality that accrues after years of study of a serious problem,\" Gates says.</span></p> <p><span>Wilson's colleagues call him \"reserved\" but also contend that underneath his tweed jackets with leather patches and flannel slacks he has \"a twinkly in his eye.\"</span></p> <p><span>One of Skocpol's favorite stories about Wilson, from the days when they worked together at the University of Chicago, exemplifies Wilson's reserve--and sense of humor.</span></p> <p><span>Every year the sociology graduate students at Chicago put on a program called the \"Spring Follies\" that includes skits about faculty members.  One year in particular, when Wilson's urban poverty  research received millions of dollars of grants from several foundations, his research assistants decided to do a skit about him.</span></p> <p><span>As the skit began, says Skocpol, \"[Wilson] sat in the audience looking serious, Al Gore-like, as he always does.\"</span></p> <p><span>The skit featured a student playing Wilson as he went out into the inner-city to study poverty.  Skocpol says the student playing Wilson knocked on a door in the ghetto and said, \"Hello!  I'm Bill Wilson, the Lucy Flower University Professor from the University of Chicago.  And I have been given a million dollars by a prestigious foundation to study...YOU!\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Well, [Wilson] watched this all very seriously, with everyone surreptitiously watching to see how he would react to the obvious teasing about all the money he was getting to study the desperately poor,\" says Skocpol.  \"And then, suddenly, just as the 'YOU' and the handshake occurred...[Wilson] broke out into a huge smile, one of the biggest I have ever seen him give.\"</span></p> <p><span>Those who work with Wilson, who is in his early 60s, have nothing but praise for the sociologist.</span></p> <p><span>\"I have never known anyone...who does not like Bill Wilson as a person, which is pretty unusual for someone as prominent as he is,\" Skocpol says.</span></p> <p><span>\"[Wilson] is someone who is modest and very willing to listen to other people's opinions,\" says Edward Walker, Wilson's personal assistant.  \"He doesn't assert all the time that he is right.\"</span></p> <p><span>But Wilson does travel extensively around the country to speak about his research.  And he has become a valued adviser to the Clinton administration.</span></p> <p><span>\"It's odd that the man I spend my life working for,\" says Walker, \"I frequently don't get to see.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"He's one of those people who has a terrible time saying 'no.'  So he's terribly overcommitted\" Jencks says.  \"Actually, he may say 'no' 80 percent of the time, and he's still terribly overcommitted.\"</span></p> <p><span>Wilson's students say he is a valued adviser--though he is at times remote because of his busy schedule.</span></p> <p><span>\"He's not the kind of mentor who's there all the time,\" says Mignon R. Moore, a fifth-year graduate student at Chicago.  \"But if you ask him to read something or consider some ideas you have, he'll get back to you.  He's very encouraging and motivating.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>Affecting Social Policy</b></span></p> <p><span>Wilson's move to Harvard marks a major turn in his career.  No longer will he be in a sociology department; in fact, now he is a government school professor.</span></p> <p><span>But Wilson, as independent in action as he is in thought, wants this.  When Wilson announced his decision to come to Harvard last February, he told reporters that he wanted to join a faculty where he could affect social policy.</span></p> <p><span>Wilson resisted the recruiting efforts of Gates, the Kennedy School and Harvard presidents for years.  Only in the last two years or so was there any hint that Wilson might be thinking of leaving Chicago.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard first learned of Wilson's interest in moving to the University in the living room of Vice President Al Gore '69 in February 1995.</span></p> <p><span>According to Gates, the Clinton administration gathered a group of leading scholars on race in America to discuss the upcoming presidential election.</span></p> <p><span>As he did each time he saw Wilson for five years, Gates asked the sociologist when he was coming to Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>Wilson responded that if Gates and the University were serious, the time just might be right to make the move.  A year later, Wilson announced he would be a Harvard professor.</span></p> <p><span>Like Wilson, Gates and the Afro-Am department have set their sites on having a powerful voice in social policy debates.</span></p> <p><span>Wilson may well be the key to success.</span></p> <p><span>As President Clinton has said many times, <i>\"[The Truly Disadvantaged]</i> made me see the problems of race and poverty in the inner-city in a different light.\"<c><cred>Photo Courtesy of the Harvard News office<n><b>WILLIAM JULIUS WILSON</b></n></cred></c></span></p>"}
{"title": "All HYPEd Up | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>I have to admit that my first impression of HYPE '96 was not a very favorable one.  I was rudely awakened early Saturday morning to the sound of hammering and upon peering out of Winthrop House noticed that a large stage was being built right underneath my window.  I was able to drift back to sleep for a little while, only to be awakened again by a repeated test of a very powerful audio system.  My roommates and I--and no doubt countless dorm inhabitants around us--cursed and spat for a while and decided that if we had anything to do with it, HYPE '96 would meet a swift and sudden death.</span></p> <p><span>Once I actually made it down to the MAC Quad, however, I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by the the Institute of Politics' day-long Harvard Youth for Political Empowerment carnival-cum-rally.  It was something very rare at Harvard--a well-organized, thoughtfully-planned, color-coordinated event that students actually attended.  In droves.</span></p> <p><span>It was a great idea to center the activity around carnival games run by student groups.  Of course, with a large number of first years showing up for HYPE, the event did border on a sequel to tabling outside registration.  But this fair had a different flavor--group leaders talked to each other; students were able to converse with club members and see them show their creativity in creating a carnival atmosphere; and Harvard suddenly looked like a place with a lot of school spirit.</span></p> <p><span>Truthfully, I have never seen anything like it in my four years here.  I particularly enjoyed the comment of one sunglass-clad first year who said, \"When I came to Harvard, I expected I'd be in the library all the time.  But all they do here is have fun events outdoors.\"  I didn't have the heart to tell her that with the exception of HYPE and the occasional Springfest exciting outdoor activity other than a long walk through the snow to class is not exactly the student body's strong point.</span></p> <p><span>Coupling the student booths with a mainstage slate of political speakers was also a good idea.  It was sad, though, to see that the MTV \"Choose or Lose\" bus was attracting more attention from the crowd than George Stephanopoulous, Robert Reich, Barney Frank and Susan Weld.  I was disappointed to see how few folks were paying attention to the stage during their excellent and often inspirational speeches.</span></p> <p><span>There were, of course, complaints that the Institute of Politics presented a rather partisan assortment of speakers.  But looking at the countless Clinton/Gore signs in the audience, the student body generally seems in agreement with the political stance of the IOP.  A couple of more creative students even rearranged the letters on the Dole sign to read OLDE--a fairly apt statement from a day devoted to the empowerment of youth.  I even heard someone joke that the members of Harvard Republican club were actually going to devote their booth to campaigning solely for Kemp 2000 so that they would be taken more seriously.</span></p> <p><span>And though I'd love to say that the success of HYPE '96 shows a new energy among undergraduates for matters political, there were those who were lured--and even forced--to the event by clever food orchestration.  It was brilliant strategy on the part of the IOP to have the Kirkland, Eliot, and Winthrop dining halls close for lunch and serve outside instead.  However, while it was a rather underhanded way to make hundreds of people attend HYPE who might otherwise have not, the crowds definately stayed around longer than they would have for the usual quick lunch.</span></p> <p><span>So, while I do think that the students living in the nearby river houses should have been given fair warning about the noise and disruption they might face--in a final insult, my roommate was even asked to show her Harvard ID as she tried to get past the barricades to get back into Winthrop House later in the day--the event was a great one.  I hope we can continue to delude our first years into thinking that these days happen all the time by supporting even more terrific events like HYPE '96.</span></p> <p><span><i>Corinne E.

{"title": "Searching for Kurt Loder | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>It's Saturday, September 21.  The e-mail I receive from the IOP about HYPE '96 teases, \"MTV will be there, will you?\"  so I arrive at the MAC Quad early, determined  to pigeonhole one of the station's bigwigs.  Ready to pretend I'm a journalist, I have a few questions written on a note card about MTV's role in the political process:  \"Are 'Choose or Lose' specials and the 'Week in Rock' programs objective news accounts?  Doesn't MTV's hosting of a ball at the Clinton inaugural imply a partisan leaning?  But if CBS held an inaugural ball, wouldn't that taint its journalistic credibility?\"  If I keep this routine up long enough, I am hoping, someone will become uncomfortable enough to tell me something interesting.</span></p> <p><span>But amazingly, as I circle the giant \"Choose or Lose\" bus, I can't find a single person connected with MTV.  Standing confused and perturbed in front of the bus, I'm attacked by a horde of \"Rock the Vote\" volunteers, and I shoo them off rather impolitely.  I harbor unnatural hostility for the Rock the Vote campaign, and for the idea of activist voter registration in general.  They bother me in much the same way it bother me when playoff ticket land in the laps of casual fans.  I have no real grounds to be annoyed, but still, there's an undeniable elitist suspicion that if people don't have to work hard for precious things, they won't appreciate what they're getting.</span></p> <p><span>One of the most prominently featured quotes painted on the bus, attributed to Ice Cube, illustrates my worst fears:  \"You might as well pull the lever, what 'Chu afraid of?\"  He makes voting sound like a painless way to fill up a free afternoon.</span></p> <p><span>A young woman volunteer remains undeterred, even after I've explained that I'm registered.  \"You haven't filled out a pledge yet, have you?\"  she asks, and I haven't.  We get to talking and she tells me MTV's only involvement in the event is in providing the bus and sponsoring the voting drive.  The pledge, she explains, will be sent back to me before election day, so I don't forget to vote.  After I fill in my name, address and intention of vote, I get to line that reads, \"You will vote because...\"  Curiousto hear what she has to say on the subject, I ask, \"I dunno, why should I vote?\"  \"Oh,\" she responds, as if I'm not the first to ask this question, \"you can just put down, 'because I want to .\"</span></p> <p><span>Disappointed by my failure to find, let alone rankle the MTV brass, I resolve to head for the Boston Common where the day's other political event is being held:  the seventh annual Freedom Fest, a rally for marijuana legalization.  But on the way to fetch some change for the T, I nearly trip over Labor Secretary Robert Reich. Literally.</span></p> <p><span>The interesting thing about running into Reich is the <i>first</i> you behold an incredibly short, mature adult and <i>then</i> you notice that the incredibly short adult is Robert Reich, one of the most powerful people in the executive branch.  Searching desperately for a provocative, newsworthy question to ask him, my mind goes blank.  Before I can pull myself together, two HRTV people whisk him away to do an interview.  Their camera looks remarkably like the palmcorder my parents  received as a gift for their 20th anniversary.</span></p> <p><span>The common is teeming with people when I arrive.  Tens of thousands of alternateens fill the park--most of them too young to vote--with pockets of older folks mixed in.  There are a smattering of signs calling for \"decriminalization,\" but the atmosphere is that of a huge party of very calm people.  Letters to Cleo, an announcer tells us, is about to take the stage; I almost tripped over Robert Reich, but I can't even get close enough to Letters to Cleo to see them.</span></p> <p><span>I make my way slowly through the crowd, past the High Times booth, past the marijuana paraphernalia stand.  Eventually, I find myself in front of a T-shirt concession stand which, curiously, seems to be selling shirts with the logo of the Republican presidential tickets.  As I wade in closer, though, it becomes clear that the shirt in fact reads \"DOPE/HEMP '96\".  I'm relieved, and with my world view intact, I ride the crowd out toward the bandstand.</span></p> <p><span><i>Dan S. Aibel's Column appears on alternate Wednesdays.</i></span></p>"}
{"title": "SHE'S NO LIMOUSINE LIBERAL | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Cambridge residents are accustomed to having an experienced legislator represent them on Beacon Hill.</span></p> <p><span>Former U.S. House Speaker Thomas \"Tip\" O'Neill's political career began in the 27th Middlesex District.  Its most recent state representative, Charles F. Flaherty, doubled as the Massachusetts House Speaker, before resigning amid corruption indictments this spring.</span></p> <p><span>No doubt, the experience factor played a role in former mayor Alice K. Wolf's victory over City Councillor Anthony D. Galluccio in last Tuesday's Democratic primary.</span></p> <p><span>Wolf, 63, has held virtually every civic office, from mayor to state party caucus member to school committee member.  Galluccio, 29, has served on the city council a mere three years.</span></p> <p><span>\"Alice has been in government for a long time, and her votes are well-known.  There is no surprise where her stands are,\" says Geneva T. Malenfant, president of the progressive Cambridge Civic Association.  \"With Galluccio, he's only been city councillor one and half terms, and some of his views seem to have changed between last year and this.\"</span></p> <p><span>City Councillor Francis H. Duehay '55 adds:  \"Charles Flaherty, who represented this district for 30 years, was a progressive politician who had a lot of experience in government.  Alice Wolf has come up through the ranks in Cambridge and has 25 years in local government experience.  Galluccio has just begun his career in local government.\"</span></p> <p><span>In representing the district, which stretches from wealthy, progressive Harvard Square to the ethnic blue-collar sections of northwest Cambridge, O'Neill coined the phrase \"all politics is local.\"</span></p> <p><span>But by a 90-vote margin out of 7,600 cast, voters chose Wolf, a non-native Cantabrigian known more as a detached idealogue, over lifelong resident Galluccio, who has strong ties to the working class.</span></p> <p><span>The division is evident in unofficial election results:  76.5 percent of upscale west Cambridge voters went to Wolf, while Galluccio won North Cambridge by a 2:1 margin.</span></p> <p><span>Cambridge Mayor Sheila Doyle Russell says many North Cambridge voters consider Wolf, a former IOP fellow, a limousine liberal, rather than one of their own.</span></p> <p><span>\"She's much more liberal than long time North Cambridge residents.  Some feel she doesn't represent their views,\" Russell says.</span></p> <p><span>\"There's always been a kind of division between working class folks and white collar folks.  I think it remains to be seen if Mrs. Wolf will represent them as before.  She claims she will.  Let's hope she does,\" Russell says.</span></p> <p><span>Wolf is guaranteed election Nov.5--she has no Republican opponent.  Then she'll begin the difficult task of representing both factions in this district.</span></p> <p><span><b>Reaching Everyone</b></span></p> <p><span>Wolf strategically placed her campaign headquarters in the heart of North Cambridge, just three doors down from Galluccio's, and just across the street from a steakhouse frequented by O'Neill.</span></p> <p><span>\"People want neighborhood services, and I will be working on those,\" Wolf says, taking a line from O'Neill's campaign notebook.</span></p> <p><span>She adds that she's concerned with all voters and cites her campaign's emphasis on economic security and better schools and job training.</span></p> <p><span>City councillor and former mayor Kenneth E. Reeves '72 says Wolf's support of expanded public health benefits, a higher minimum wage and the \"expiring use\" provision, designed to create affordable housing, endeared her to working class voters and tenants in this formerly rent-controlled city.</span></p> <p><span>\"She did very well in public housing and very well with minority constituents,\" Reeves says.</span></p> <p><span>Galluccio earned the backing of numerous labor unions and an endorsement from two newspapers.</span></p> <p><span>And in one black precinct, Galluccio beat Wolf by a two-to-one margin because of Wolf's opposition to the opening of a predominantly-black school in west Cambridge.</span></p> <p><span>\"Anyone who's opposed to bringing young black youths into the city does not deserve black votes,\" Damon Brooks, a black resident, told the Cambridge Chronicle.</span></p> <p><span>Wolf says she'll stay in contact with voters, and seek clout by campaigning for U.S. Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.) and President Clinton.</span></p> <p><span>\"We made a conscious effort to reach out to all people in the district,\" Wolf says.  \"Remember, I was a local elected official and have worked with people all over the city.\"</span></p> <p><span>Speaking of Wolf's 20-plus years of political experience, Reeves says:  \"I think she will do all that is humanly possible to represent every voice in the district.  I don't think she will be anything other than gracious.\"</span></p> <p><span>Graciously bridging the gap is Wolf's mission.  The liberal Democrat, who once took a freedom of speech lawsuit all the way to the Supreme Court, and won, is working hard to please more moderate North Cantabrigians, who stick with the Democratic Party because of its ties to labor.</span></p> <p><span>She acknowledges the difficulty of filling the shoes of Flaherty, who enjoyed immense popularity and ruled the state house in the old-time political tradition.</span></p> <p><span>North Cambridge hasn't changed much over the years, but in the aftermath of rent control's abolition by statewide referendum two years ago, there's been an influx of upscale residents in all neighborhoods.</span></p> <p><span>For Wolf, that means embracing Flaherty and O'Neill's tradition while pursuing her own issues.</span></p> <p><span>\"All politics is definitely still local.  This district is used to good constituent services, and I will continue work on those things,\" she says.</span></p> <p><span>Sounds like something with which everyone would agree.</span></p> <p><span>The Cambridge City Council did not meet Monday, due to Yom Kippur.  It will meet next Monday at City Hall at regularly scheduled time</span></p>"}

{"title": "Congress Must Not Restrict Internet | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>O</b>n Thursday, President Clinton took yet another step away from ideals of democracy and civil liberties by signing the Communications Decency Act into law.  The act--a sweeping reorganization of the laws which govern the communications and media industry in America--contains provisions we find totally unacceptable as college students and American citizens.</span></p> <p><span>Most of the new act deals with deregulating competition in the newspaper, television, cable and telephone businesses.  But our focus will be the bill's indecency provision.  Pushed through congress by a small faction of conservative Republicans, with Representative Henry J. Hyde at the vanguard, the provision mandates fines and prison terms for those who make \"indecent\" material available to minors.  Even Newt Gingrich did not support this measure.  The flaws inherent in this bill become apparent during a straightforward examination of the phrase make indecent material available to minors.\"</span></p> <p><span>First of all, we believe that \"indecent\" is a heinous concept to adopt as a legal standard because it is so eminently undefinable.  In general legal parlance, \"indecent\" is a superset of \"obscene\", and hence includes not only sexually explicit material but also four-letter words and sexual material deemed \"patently offensive\" by local community standards.  Under this standard, anything ranging from pornographic animation to a frank discussion of AIDS could be construed as indecent and draw the fire of federal prosecutors.  Ironically, any document which explicitly describes what the new law prohibits would be theoretically banned from the Internet.  We urge all to think of what this means for freedom of speech and the marketplace of ideas.</span></p> <p><span><b>E</b>ven if it were possible to define \"indecent\" with some degree of rigor, the bill would still be fatally flawed because the Internet is simply too dynamic and fluid to effectively regulate.  For example, a private e-mail sent from one person to another can easily find its way onto a bulletin board where it is accessible to the public.  Thus, the four Cornell first-years who recently authored an infamous e-mail which insulted women and used four-letter words could well have found themselves in trouble with the federal government.  It doesn't matter that their e-mail was originally a private message to friends; the fact that it spread so rapidly, unknown to them, could easily have brought the message to the hands of a minor--and the misogynistic Cornellians to a courtroom.  Although their message was offensive, it was protected under the First Amendment.  As extensive users of electronic communication, Harvard and other college communities are especially affected by this new law.</span></p> <p><span>But perhaps the biggest problem is the burden imposed on commercial on-line services.  To date, some of these companies have made it their policy to censor themselves to some degree, while others have not.  The point is that they had the choice.  Now, all on-line services will be forced to assume the unreasonable burden of screening the millions of pages of information they carry each day, lest they somehow allow an indecent message to find its way into the hands of a minor.</span></p> <p><span>The motives of the sponsors of these new laws may be noble, or they may simply be an attempt to use the law to impose a set of values on the entire United States.  Either way, we feel that the indecency law is entirely unacceptable both for practical and ideological reasons.  While we agree that it is important to prevent children from accessing certain types of materials, this in no way requires the federal government to invade civil society in this manner.  If the Republicans want to follow Bob Dole's lead and urge on-line companies to voluntarily regulate their content, this is fine.  Even laws requiring the software equivalent of the V-chip would be acceptable, because they would in no way restrict what could legally be posted on the Internet, but rather would bolster the ability of parents to <i>privately</i> and <i>individually</i> control what their children see.</span></p> <p><span>We only hope that this law will be struck down by the Supreme Court at the first opportunity.  We also suspect that it will prove difficult and cumbersome to enforce.  But whatever the eventual outcome, the signing of this bill is bad for the Internet, bad for freedom of speech and bad for society.</span></p>"}

And to many Americans who aren't computer-savvy, the CDA is greeted with unqualified praise.  \"We've gotta keep those molesters away from our children,\" they might say.</span></p> <p><span>This view of the Internet as a haven for pornography and child solicitation is rampant, and seemingly monthly news stories showcase children \"seduced\" by molesters via services like America Online.</span></p> <p><span>These misconceptions about the Internet have led to a Congressional backlash.  Most of the uproar over the CDA comes not from its restrictions on the well-defined category of \"obscene\" material, but over the fuzzier genre of \"indecency.\"</span></p> <p><span>In my thesaurus, the two terms are listed as synonyms.  But the courts have drawn quite a distinction between them.  Most hard-core pornography falls into the category of obscenity, and there is a long legal tradition of regulating this material according to community standards.</span></p> <p><span>However, the CDA also makes it a crime to transmit \"indecent\" material over the Internet.  While the courts have not defined this term as clearly, curse words and images of nudity probably fall into this category.  As one critic of the CDA notes, the presence of indecent material in motion pictures separates a 'G' rating from a 'PG.'</span></p> <p><span>We see indecent material in the world around us all the time; The Crimson, for instance, can (and does) print the \"F-word\" in its articles without any fear of government censorship.</span></p> <p><span>But if The Crimson put that article online, and a minor accessed it, the paper, its editors and the author could be subject to prosecution for a federal crime.</span></p> <p><span>Many opponents of the CDA see nothing wrong with more protection for children on the Internet to avoid obscenity.  In fact, America Online and CompuServe already have parental control features to let kids use their services without being exposed to unsuitable material.  Similar programs, like SurfWatch, provide filters for the users directly accessing the Internet.</span></p> <p><span>Instead of using these solutions as a model, however, Congress and President Clinton took the \"meat-cleaver\" approach, passing a law that effectively dumbs down the public areas of the Internet to a level suitable for all ages.</span></p> <p><span>The chilling effect this could have on Internet communications is widespread, and the focus on indecency affects more than just the Playboy Web site.  Images of classical works of art like Michelangelo's \"David\" or Botticelli's \"The Birth of Venus\" might no longer be available over the Internet, since the nudity displayed in the pieces would technically be indecent.</span></p> <p><span>Even classic pieces of literature, from <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> to <i>The Catcher In The Rye,</i> would no longer be available via electronic libraries, since occasionally vulgar language might not be legally \"proper\" for children.</span></p> <p><span>The law isn't going without challenges, of course.  Civil rights groups in and out of cyberspace, including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), sued to test the constitutionality of the law.  Yesterday, a federal judge banned the goverment from enforcing the law until he hears arguments on the lawsuit.  Many observers believe the CDA will be found to violate First Amendment rights of speech and expression.</span></p> <p><span>But just in case, contact your Representative and Senators to urge them to vote to repeal the CDA.

{"title": "Political Fluff Hurts | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The Republican presidential hopefuls parade around New Hampshire like little kids lusting after candy.  As if they thought there was nothing greater about the presidency than jelly beans.  How sweet it seems in our common childhood fantasies to run the U.S. government.  We value it like a precious jewel before coming to the understanding that the state is simply an organization defined by a geographical area that claims a monopoly of the legitimate use of violence and is respected for its power.</span></p> <p><span>What kid wouldn't like to be president?  Like many on this campus, I saw the presidency as the ultimate credential when I was younger.  Precocious youngsters develop the need for affirmation; someone telling them that they are somehow the best and brightest.  And for the now-mature over-achievers that we all know and love as friends here, the presidency seemed to offer that.  Besides being confirmed as among the top of their class, what little kid wouldn't want to plop his or her feet up on the desk of the Oval Office and smoke a nice wooden pipe?</span></p> <p><span>The mental block that plagued us in the imaginative quest for higher office was the delusion that politics is an end in itself.  After all, it is very easy to equate it to gaming and make a sport of it.  The farcical nature of Washington life, combined with personalities galore and the definite win-lose scoreboard on every bill and election, do much to lighten the serious business of government.  Seen in this light, politics is only nominally different from baseball.  The front page news holds little greater levity than that on the back page.</span></p> <p><span>Such is the opinion of John F. Kennedy Jr., whose new magazine George covers politics with a sense of rock-and-roll idolatry.  Now, George is an extremely readable, interesting publication.  The February/March 1996 issue interviews Larry King about interviewing and tackles the plagiarism put forth by The New Republic's Ruth Shalit.  But the reporting, if one can call it that, has as its basis a thumbs-up/thumbs-down approach based on nothing more than style.</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps we shouldn't expect anything greater than such image-making from the son of Camelot.  In the current issue we have plenty of it-a shirtless and bewigged Charles Barkley dressed as our first president; a puff piece titled \"Jesus in '96,\" and presidential candidate makeovers.  George reads as if nothing more were at stake in the election than the aesthetics of the face behind that nice blue podium.</span></p> <p><span>But this substance abuse problem is not limited to second-rate magazines.  As James M. Fallows '70 noted in last Sunday's New York Times, the mainstream media \"missed the message\" in its election coverage so far by focusing on politics as a game.  He writes, \"Sizing up Lamar Alexander against Bob Dole is like having a preseason argument about whether the Yankees or the Dodgers might go all the way this year.\"  Isn't the difference that something greater is at stake?  And doesn't the media, as independent power holders, have a responsibility to present politics as such?</span></p> <p><span>The presidency is a seat of power.  Unlike the red-and-black trademarked Alexander, we shouldn't care whether it is covered in plaid.  In terms of substance, the public has heard very little.  CNN's sound bite from NBC's \"Meet the Press\" with Alexander has the candidate saying that he was chock full of new ideas, yet he didn't mention one.  He comes across as just another hollow option.</span></p> <p><span>So Steve Forbes' flat tax has become about the best idea going, since it is just about the only idea around.  We are almost willing to sacrifice the presidency to a single-issue candidate because there are no multiple-issue ones.  The substance vacuum that is plaguing America distorts the political process.  The voters of New Hampshire go to the polls today aware of the presidential horse-race but ignorant about what those horses will do once in the winner's circle.</span></p> <p><span><i>Joshua A.

The well-attended event, which features students on ice skates jumping over beer kegs, typifies the spirit of celebration that characterizes Dartmouth's Winter Carnival.</span></p> <p><span>The festival weekend draws alumni from all over the country and completely occupies the attention of most students in the weeks before the carnival.</span></p> <p><span>Because of the carnival--as well as many other factors--many Dartmouth students are not involved with the upcoming primary.</span></p> <p><span>Only those registered as Republicans in New Hampshire are eligible to vote.  On a campus where some students confess they have never met anyone who legally resides in the Granite State, it is not surprising to see a low level of student involvement in this year's campaigns.</span></p> <p><span><b>Apathy on Campus</b></span></p> <p><span>Dartmouth students characterize the student body as generally apathetic politically, with whatever student involvement exists centered around journalistic and political organizations.</span></p> <p><span>This general indifference frustrates some student leaders.</span></p> <p><span>\"I don't think that Dartmouth students are very political overall,\" says first-year Rex L. Morey, a member of the Student Assembly and Freshman Council.</span></p> <p><span>Instead of being involved with outside politics, Morey says, Dartmouth students tend to be more interested in internal school affairs, which they believe they can directly influence.</span></p> <p><span>\"The most active groups on campus are the Student Assembly and the class councils,\" Morey says.  \"They focus on school policy and student concerns.  These groups are popular because students see that they achieve things and their work has an impact.\"</span></p> <p><span>Students questioned during last weekend's Winter Carnival demonstrated a greater interest in the festival than in the political process, confirming Morey's view of an indifferent student body.</span></p> <p><span>Senior Gholson J.

Siobhan Gorman, the paper's managing editor.</span></p> <p><span>\"We certainly cover when the candidates come here,\" she says.  \"We have a policy that we cover when they first come to New Hampshire this term, and after then, only when they come to Dartmouth.\"</span></p> <p><span>In addition, Gorman says the paper tries to explain the relevance of the primary to the campus.</span></p> <p><span>\"We had a series on the campaign and how it affects Dartmouth students,\" she says.</span></p> <p><span><b>Liberal-Conservative Split</b></span></p> <p><span>One might expect somewhat more involvement from Dartmouth students in this year's Republican campaign than has actually occurred, given the Ivy League school's reputation of being a conservative campus.</span></p> <p><span>New Hampshire itself is also generally considered a Republican state.</span></p> <p><span>\"It's a conservative state,\" says Davis, the Forbes supporter.  \"We have the lowest taxes of any state in the country.\"</span></p> <p><span>But the characterization of Dartmouth as a conservative school is currently being debated on campus.</span></p> <p><span>Some students say they feel that Dartmouth's conservative label is a part of the school's history that should be respected.</span></p> <p><span>\"Like the other Ivy League schools, there is a long and dignified tradition that lies behind the Dartmouth name,\" says sophomore David E. Mace, a registered Minnesota Republican.</span></p> <p><span>The school's most vocal conservatives tend to gravitate toward the Dartmouth Review, an independently-funded newspaper which Mace calls \"a bastion of not only conservative intellectual thought but also of dignity and tradition, the cloth that binds our society.\"</span></p> <p><span>Moderate and liberal students, on the other hand, discount the Review's claim to represent the majority of Dartmouth students.</span></p> <p><span>\"There's been a lot of press about how Dartmouth is a more conservative institution, partially because the Dartmouth Review is a very, very conservative institution,\" Serrentino says.  \"They're a very small but vocal minority.\"</span></p> <p><span>Serrentino, the radio producer, says Dartmouth offers \"a very healthy split of opinion.\"</span></p> <p><span>A recent visit by presidential candidate and Sen. Robert J. Dole (R-Kan.) illustrates the possibility of ideological balance on campus.</span></p> <p><span>\"We have a reputation for being mostly conservatives,\" says junior Cheryl L.

There was support for him but there were people outside who were holding signs for Clinton.\"</span></p> <p><span>With Democrats now making their presence on campus felt, some wonder whether Dartmouth's conservative tradition is still vibrant or whether it is as much a dinosaur as the snow stegosaurus erected on the green for the Winter Carnival.</span></p>"}

Judd Gregg (R-N.H.) told reporters that Alexander is not a legitimate contender, that Buchanan's support would not stretch beyond the state line and that Dole is the only candidate who represents Republican ideals.</span></p> <p><span>\"Dole came out of New Hampshire one of two candidates in the race,\" Gregg said.  \"Bob Dole is the only person with the credentials to take on Bill Clinton.\"</span></p> <p><span>But Dole's inability to articulate a clear message and his failure to offer voters anything more than a promise of steady leadership proved to be his downfall here.</span></p> <p><span>\"Buchanan was able to stress easy issues and play on people's fears,\" said Hanover resident Ed Lord.  \"[Dole] has a theme, but he has to communicate it better.\"</span></p> <p><span>Last night, Dole tried to portray Buchanan as someone who would split the Republican party into two.  He also tried to entice both Buchanan and Alexander supporters to join his campaign.</span></p> <p><span>\"If you believe in economic growth...if you believe in the values that made America strong then you have a home in the Dole campaign,\" said Dole, the Senate Majority Leader.</span></p> <p><span>\"We want to be an inclusive party and we want to make room for more and more people across America,\" Dole said.</span></p> <p><span>John Frey, the coordinator of Dole's Connecticut headquarters, said polls show Dole with a 17 point lead in that state and downplayed Dole's finish here.</span></p> <p><span>But the loss is a clear blow to Dole's campaign, and he now has begun this presidential primary season in a rather inauspicious manner.</span></p> <p><span>He barely squeezed out a victory in last week's Iowa caucus and he finished second here after once having a 20 point lead.</span></p> <p><span>Buchanan in New Hampshire repeated his strong showing in Alaska, Louisiana and Iowa where he drew voters from anti-abortionists and social conservatives.</span></p> <p><span>Alexander and Dole split the support of the moderate conservatives and some 60 percent of Republicans who favor free trade thereby enabling Buchanan's camp to emerge victorious.</span></p> <p><span>And millionaire publisher Malcolm S. \"Steve\" Forbes, who Buchanan and Dole have blasted as \"too liberal\" said last night at his headquarters in Nashua that his fourth place finish was enough to keep in the race.</span></p> <p><span>\"My views about how to get America moving are larger than this campaign,\" he said:  \"We are setting an agenda.\"</span></p> <p><span>William Bennett, the national chair of the Alexander campaign and former Education Secretary, urged voters to come to a consensus and to keep the nomination out of Buchanan's hands.</span></p> <p><span>\"The party will not nominate Pat Buchanan,\" Bennett told the Crimson yesterday.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Get Back on Track | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>he term \"third rail\" is political slang for issues that are sidetracked because they are politically charged and likely to deter voters.  Sidetracking is common in American politics today, in issues ranging from health care to the federal budget.  Does the sidetracking of crucial issues help or hurt voters in the long run?</span></p> <p><span>We can definitely say that last month's budget impasse was third-railed.  Clinton recently reprimanded his top political adviser, Dick Morris, about the disclosure of polling data to the Dole campaign.  Based on confidential figures and estimates, Morris sent a message advising Dole to support Clinton's mainstay, a seven-year balanced budget deal including a capital gains cut and a $500-per-child tax credit.</span></p> <p><span>What's interesting here are not the specifics of the plan, which could presumably garner votes for Dole, but the fact, implicit in the disclosure, that polling data is used for political ends.  The message that Morris really sent to Dole was that Dole should sidestep his personal convictions and even reasoned opinions by conforming to public wishes in order to gain votes.</span></p> <p><span><b>P</b>olling data, then, is often used more for gauging possible voter outcomes in hopes of winning elections than for assessing popular opinion in hopes of serving public interest.  Devil's advocate, the polls simply reflect public opinion.  Isn't the practice of basing decisions on polls noble and fair as long as the public is heard and popular opinion expressed in the upper echelons of the government?</span></p> <p><span>No.  Because popular opinion is not necessarily expressed.  Morris' memo specified that Dole would lose the New Hampshire and Iowa primaries if he did not follow Morris' advice.  Since Dole is from Kansas, the fact that New Hampshire and Iowa would affect his political decisions could shift his concern to states other than Kansas.  Dole would act neither as a Senator nor a Statesman should, because his attention would not be focused on his state.  This politicking is so ingrained in the political process that it doesn't seem wrong.</span></p> <p><span>Of course, Dole did not go along, and the whole story was exposed and made public, but the Morris incident is a window to the inner workings of politics in Washington.  It seems as though tunnel vision on the part of politicians hurts the American people in the long run because it necessitates third-railing.  The federal budget negotiations were third-railed and resulted in an impasse.  Schools all over the country floundered to make crucial staff decisions without knowing how much money they would receive from Uncle Sam.  Result:  contingency layoffs, and the impasse had even more far-reaching results in its general slowing of the economy.</span></p> <p><span>Health care is another issue that has been third-railed.  Granted, the process takes time, but party bickering and concern for voter reactions consumed most of the politicians' energy.  Especially with medical care, politicians are supposed to be disinterested persons weighing the people's wants alongside practical considerations and informed opinions from doctors and health administrators.  Instead, as we witnessed in the Health Care War I, many of the battles over health care were battles for credit and, ultimately, votes.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>n issues such as the federal budget, health care and even environmental regulation, opinion polls should be left out of the whole policy-making process completely.  Politicians should act on their strong convictions.  Or, allow polls to completely determine policy.  In that gray area between public determination and true statesmanship, politicians have their heyday.  And the American people (people, not just \"voters\") have a bad day.  In the current political process, \"voters\" are \"third-railed.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "Saving America's Children | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>he epidemic of violence in America attacks the youngest and most vulnerable members of our society.  Today in America, thousands of children will watch as 5,760 women will be beaten.  According to the Centers for Disease Control, 15 children will be shot and killed by a handgun and 100,000 handguns will enter the 35,000 U.S. public schools.  According to the U.S. Department of Justice, 312 children will be arrested today for committing a violent crime; 9 of these arrests will be for murder.  Today in America, according to the Pacific Center for Violence Prevention, one out of every four teenage deaths will be attributed to a firearm; more teenage boys will die from gunshot wounds than from all natural causes combined.  Children in America are exposed to a tremendous amount of violence--in their homes, schools, communities, and through the media.</span></p> <p><span>The cost to our children and to our country is extremely high.  It is estimated that children will see 100,000 acts of violence on television before they enter the seventh grade.  According to Metropolitan Life's national survey of rural, urban, and suburban junior high school students, 36% believe their schools do only a fair or poor job of providing a safe environment in the school building.  The same survey found that 16% of students reported being the victim of a violent incident that took place in or around their school.  According to the Centers for Disease Control, an African-American male born in 1989 has a 1 in 27 chance of being murdered during his lifetime.  The cost of this violence is staggering.  Former Massachusetts Commissioner of Public Health, Dr. Deborah Prothrow-Stith, estimates the cost at $60 billion a year, 85% of which is underwritten by tax payers.  But the emotional cost is unmeasurable.</span></p> <p><span><b>C</b>hildren, particularly young children, look towards adults to keep them safe.  Yet in 1991, 2.7 million children were reported to child protection agencies as victims of physical, emotional, and sexual abuse, three times the number as in 1980.  According to the U.S. Justice Department, of the 2,595 juveniles (ages 12-17) killed in 1992, 76% of were killed by adults.  Many of these children were killed by someone they should have trusted:  40% of juvenile homicide victims were killed by family members, most of them parents; 45% were murdered by friends, neighbors, or acquaintances.  If traditional havens of safety -- schools, families, neighborhoods -- are being eroded, what options are left for children?</span></p> <p><span>Violence is, of course, more than statistics.  Behind every number and percentage is a name, a face, and a grief.  There is also a culpability and responsibility that we all share.  The problem of youth violence is not a \"ghetto\" problem from which we can hide, behind the wrought-iron gates of Harvard.  The problem is widespread and complicated, affecting children in rural and suburban areas as well as urban children.  In 1987, 415,000 violent crimes occurred in or around schools.  We all have a responsibility to provide a safe community for children--all children.  Since we share in the problem, we must also share in its solutions.</span></p> <p><span><b>C</b>are about children.  Children need to be safe and loved.  They must be taught peacemaking skills and nurtured in their efforts to figure the world out.  All children--regardless of race, gender, or socio-economic status--need to be surrounded by caring adults.</span></p> <p><span>Vote and be a political voice for children.  Martin Luther King, Jr. argued that \"peace is not the absence of tension, but the presence of justice.\"  Be a moral voice for children in board rooms, classrooms, voting booths and homes.  According to the Children's Defense Fund, in 1992 we spent $90 million each day to bail out the nation's savings and loans, but only $100 million for the entire year to increase Head Start programs.  Demand accountability from those who represent you, at all levels.</span></p> <p><span>Listen to the voices of children.  Children are taught, disciplined, analyzed and tested, but rarely heard.  Children who are seen but not heard will lose their voices.  We live in a social and political culture that ignores a significant portion of its members.  Young people must be seen and heard and our national agenda must be expanded to include the voices of its youngest citizens.  Margo Strom, founder of the Facing History and Ourselves Project in Boston, argued correctly that \"youth who are not allowed to be resources will become problems.\"</span></p> <p><span>Inform yourself.  Don't take the statistics on this page, or in any other paper or television show at face value.  Read, question and analyze.  Remember that all children have stories that deserve and need to be heard and remembered.

{"title": "A Demagogue Is Born | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>A</b> demagogue--\"A leader who makes use of popular prejudices and false claims and promises in order to gain power\" <i>(Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary).</i></span></p> <p><span>On February 20, 1996, a demagogue was born in the state of New Hampshire.  The fetus was conceived decades ago, metamorphosing in the politically nurturing setting of the White House into a right-wing, conservative speech writer under Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan.  The American media was a second protective womb for the developing organism on CNN's \"Crossfire\" and in such conservative papers as the St. Louis Globe-Democrat, which voiced expressions of support for Barry Goldwater and Senator Joseph McCarthy.  Finally, one week ago, the moment of emergence arrived, and out came Patrick J. Buchanan as New Hampshire's victorious Republican candidate.</span></p> <p><span>Part of what is so frightening about this man is the very fact that his ultra-right platform has not just suddenly appeared, but has been growing since the mid-1960s.  Yet only recently does it seem to have attracted such attention.  That it has gained this recognition today is an unfortunate reflection on the direction in which this country is moving.  Buchanan's extremist ideologies are directed toward addressing people's fears and resentments, giving him what New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani termed \"a career in which he has by and large been against things.\"</span></p> <p><span>These two targets, namely fear and resentment, are not the ingredients of a democracy but of history's most brutal regimes.  In a country which has prided itself on being a true melting pot for a diverse population of many different racial, ethnic, religious and cultural strands, Buchananism is at the very least problematic and at the very worst utterly destructive of our socio-political heritage.  His is the constitution of a rising demagogue.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>nd yet it seems few people comprehend the grave implications of Buchanan's appeal.  Responses to his growing power are disappointing in that they fail to address the anti-democratic (with a lower-case \"d\") and un-American nature of Buchanan's beliefs.  Many Republicans see his corporate bashing and economic protectionism as an affront to and betrayal of their party platform, ideas which reach out to a Democratic constituency.  In addition, they mourn the fact that his ultra-conservatism is giving the party a bad reputation and posing an unexpected challenge to the more moderate Bob Dole, who fares a far better chance of defeating Clinton than does Buchanan.</span></p> <p><span>Dole, selfishly-motivated, refers to Buchanan as an extremist so as to paint himself in the colors of moderation.  The New York Times reported him as saying, \"This now is a race between the mainstream and the extreme, that's what it's all about.\"  Democrats, on the other hand, are celebrating the demise of Republicanism as it becomes tainted with and supplanted by Buchananism.  Pat Buchanan's extremism has left President Clinton with what the New York Times called \"quiet glee,\" making Clinton's mistakes and controversial policies seem relatively excusable.</span></p> <p><span>In other words, politicians are focusing on how Buchanan's candidacy will affect the partisan warfare and determine the election outcome.  They consider his role in influencing the course of national politics or question the economic soundness of a complete withdrawal from the global economy.  Anti-Buchanan arguments like these do very little for the American people and their values system; they merely teach them the art of campaign tactics.  The social conservatism advocated by Buchanan should frighten and outrage our populace, and yet all it does is present politicians and voters with an unexpected, but unfortunately accepted variable.</span></p> <p><span>We have had decades of social movements, constitutional amendments and judicial precedents all advocating racial, sexual and religious equality, and yet a man can not only run for office, but actually gain a plurality of a state's votes despite the fact that he stands opposed to this historical legacy of our system.  Sure, everyone jokes about his sexism or homophobia, but this misses the point.  The situation would be humorous if he failed to obtain enough votes to last in the race, but he is not even trailing as one with such fanaticism should be.  Even once people concede that he actually emerged victorious in a state, they nevertheless laugh off the fact that he does not stand a real chance, and that at least he adds some excitement to what would otherwise be a boring showdown between the uncharged and uncharismatic former Tennessee governor Lamar Alexander and the wornout and politically mechanical Dole.</span></p> <p><span><b>N</b>o one is confronting the unfortunate fact that a system which, by definition, should filter out Buchananism has failed to do so thus far.  No one is facing the upsetting reality that white, Anglo-Saxon supremacy has grown popular.  No one is condemning Buchanan for a social ideology reminiscent of Germany in the 1930s.  No one is standing up to Buchanan purely for the purpose of preserving all for which this country stands.  It is feeling deprived of the full portrait of \"Buchanan as bigot\" which leads me to this artistic task.</span></p> <p><span>Where to begin?  Blacks, Jews, women, homosexuals--which continuously discriminated-against group is at the top of his hate list?  The common and unfortunate thread uniting all these groups is that, despite decades of struggling for equality, they continue to evoke resentment and fear from portions of the population.  It is through this window of opportunity that the winds of Buchananism blow through our society.  (The statements that follow were detailed in a 1993 report of the Anti-Defamation League).</span></p> <p><span>In 1992, Buchanan declared, \"The U.S. should stand up for values, shared values.  Why are we more shocked when a dozen people are killed in Vilnius than a massacre in Burundi?  Because they are white people.  That's who we are.  That's where America comes from.\"  All this from the mouth of the man who purports to distance himself from David Duke, Larry Pratt and Sandy Lamb so as to dissociate himself from white supremacy.  Very convincing, Mr. Buchanan.</span></p> <p><span>The demagogue further plays on American society's fears that immigrants leave U.S. natural citizens worse off economically.  However, he attacks the issue of immigration not merely from an economic standpoint but with an ethnocentric overtone.  \"Does this First World nation wish to become a Third World country?  Because that is our destiny if we do not build a sea wall against the waves of immigration rolling over our shores....\"</span></p> <p><span><b>O</b>n the issue of blacks, Buchanan asserted in 1972 that \"the ship of integration is going down.  It's not our ship.\"  By speaking in the first-person plural, Buchanan is exhibiting a detachment from black citizens.  The cause, one for which the fight continues, is not his.  This is a frightening fact--that the push for racial integration is not a goal of a political leader.  That this unconstitutional mindframe can appeal to a portion of the populace bears testimony to the erosion of America's social values.  Where are the counter-attacks to his monstrous assertions?</span></p> <p><span>Buchanan expressed his sentiments for a Christian America when he said:  \"America was a Christian country.  A quarter of a century ago, without prior consultation with a democratic people, without support in precedent or the Constitution, the Warren Court undertook the systematic de-Christianization of America.\"  It seems Buchanan ought to refresh himself on the First Amendment of our Bill of Rights.  Is not there something on religious freedom written there?</span></p> <p><span>For Buchanan, the feminist movement is against the will of God.  \"Rail as they will against discrimination, women are not endowed by nature with the same measures of single-minded ambition and the will to succeed in the fiercely competitive world of Western capitalism....  The momma bird builds the nest.  So it was, so it ever shall be.  Ronald Reagan is not responsible for this; God is.\"</span></p> <p><span>Equally condemned by God is homosexuality, according to Buchanan.  \"With 80,000 dead of AIDS, 3,000 more buried each month, our promiscuous homosexuals appear literally hell-bent on Satanism and suicide.\"</span></p> <p><span>And finally, the Jews and the State of Israel rank high on the Buchanan list of scapegoats.  In 1989, he declared, \"To orthodox Catholics, the demand to be more sensitive to Jewish concerns is becoming a joke.  Referring to Congress as an \"Israeli-occupied territory\" and as a Parliament of whores incapable of standing up for U.S. national interests, if AIPAC is on the other end of the line,\" Buchanan has deservedly been subject to charges of anti-Semitism.  Furthermore, Buchanan is known for his hyper-sensitivity to comparisons between him and Hitler--I wonder why.  Is it because he referred to the man who came closest to annihilating the Jewish people as \"an individual of great courage\" or that he equated Holocaust Survivor Syndrome with \"group fantasies of martyrdom and heroics\"?  As a man hoping to distinguish himself from Hitler, he ought to rethink his oratorical strategy.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>fter hearing statements like these, it comes as no surprise that Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, the Russian ultranationalist candidate, could call him a \"brother in arms\" and acknowledge a problem they share.  \"You say that Congress is Israeli-occupied territory.  We have the same situation in Russia.  So to survive, we could set aside places on U.S. and Russian territory to deport this small but troublesome tribe.\"</span></p> <p><span>The anti-Semitic rhetoric understandably struck a personal nerve.  I feel uneasy knowing that nearly one in three Republican voters in New Hampshire felt nothing uneasy about Buchanan.  The truth is that his is a platform which goes beyond fostering uneasiness.  His is one repulsive to the very system we have fought so hard to create.  Pat Buchanan has identified certain prejudices and fears embodied in our people and has used them as a foundation on which to erect his candidacy.</span></p> <p><span>Many are chuckling now as they watch this fanatic, making light of his extremism and trusting our system to disqualify him before he disqualifies us.  But as this demagogue rises in the political rankings, the laughter will die down.  Those who did not beforehand will then recognize that our political filtering process needs reforming.  They will then realize the grave implications of the New Hampshire primary--that out of the popular vote can come one whose very platform is utterly antithetical to our constitutionally-based political system.  That is, the ship of American democracy is going down, and it is most definitely our ship.</span></p> <p><span><i>Erica S. Schacter '97 is an editor of the Harvard Crimson.</i></span></p>"}

{"title": "Jockeying the Horse Race | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>S</b>ix days before the New Hampshire primary, the right-hand column of The New York Times' front page read \"Dole Opens Drive in New Hampshire with New Theme.\"  The article in this prime location focused on a six-sentence passage of a recent Bob Dole speech in order to explain a shift of focus in the candidate's campaign strategy.  The only kernel of information being documented was Dole's acknowledgment of uneasiness among working class Americans.  The rest of the article, the greater part, was devoted to reporter Richard L. Berke's analysis and speculation about what such an acknowledgment might mean in the coming weeks of the campaign.</span></p> <p><span>We have become accustomed to the kind of campaign coverage the media dishes out each election cycle, the story that unfolds slowly from February up on through to November.  There's the uncertain and quickly-evolving primary season, the feast of analysis during the summer conventions, the drama of election night.  But even as the public is bombarded with information about presidential politics from the traditional sources of news, these outlets are producing less and less of the kind of information useful in deciding among candidates.  And with the proliferation of \"gotcha\" questions, scandal hunts and polls, it is equally apparent that the mainstream media fail to provide candidates any real opportunity to air their views.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>homas Patterson's 1993 book <i>Out of Order</i> cuts to the heart of the problems underlying the mainstream media's coverage of the presidential election process.  His analysis is as persuasive as it is pessimistic; he argues that the press has failed miserably in its role as the organizing mechanism in recent campaigns because news reports tend to ignore policy themes in favor of the horse-race aspect of the political contest.</span></p> <p><span>While \"voters...view politics primarily as a means of choosing leaders and solving their problems,\" reporters cover the campaign as if it were an extended game, stressing themes rather than facts, devoting their space to strategy analysis rather than extended quotation.  Such coverage works to the detriment of the political process because \"when voters encounter game-centered stories, they behave more like spectators than participants in the election, responding, if at all, to the status of the race, not to what the candidates represent.\"</span></p> <p><span>Campaign coverage in the current presidential election shows all the signs of conforming to Patterson's dismal portrayal.  The Times (one of the less egregious offenders among major outlets) has run a plethora of articles in recent days that take on the game-centered approach, essentially disregarding issues in favor of analyzing the supposed motivations of candidates, their strategies and their campaign organization.</span></p> <p><span>There was a story on Pat Buchanan's politically savvy use of local radio, a piece about Dole's attempt to avoid the strategic blunders of past campaigns, an article on why Richard Lugar has not caught fire and on and on and on.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>elevision coverage has been even more susceptible to the game-centered approach to the campaign.  In recent weeks, the Sunday morning \"news\" shows, featuring the candidates and their spin doctors, have focused their discussions on strategy-based questions as well as the usual soundbite-generators.  (\"Exactly when will Senator Gramm endorse Senator Dole?\"  \"Can Alexander compete with Dole's money?\"  \"Could you support Buchanan as the nominee?\")</span></p> <p><span>Indeed, talk of strategy, organization and the dynamics of the campaign itself have infected the rhetoric of the candidates to a remarkable extent.  More so than in the past, candidates are talking about the mechanics of the campaign as part of the campaign, moving the entire electoral process closer and closer to a kind of theater of the absurd.</span></p> <p><span>After the New Hampshire primary, Lamar Alexander attributed his strong showing in large part to his opposition to the use of negative advertisements--and not, say, the belief among voters that he would perform well as president.  (Imagine asserting at a job interview that one of your best credentials is that you refuse to criticize any of the other applicants.)  He even ran ads attacking Dole for running negative ads.</span></p> <p><span>In another peculiar development, during the televised New Hampshire primary debate Dole criticized Steve Forbes for airing television commercials which he believed were responsible for driving his \"positive ratings\" towards zero.  (Imagine Fidel Castro making a similar complaint against the Kennedy administration.)  Forget about proposals, ideas, ability to lead--these guys are too busy criticizing each other's criticisms.</span></p> <p><span>It's as if the campaign has turned on itself.  At times it seems that the candidates are perfectly willing to let themselves be perceived as being more caught up in the politics of the campaign than in the politics of the nation.  The result of this campaign within a campaign is that issues of governance get relegated to secondary status.  The word \"issues\" itself has been bastardized to the extent that any call for their discussion is tainted by introducing the term itself.</span></p> <p><span><b>D</b>espite the failings of the media, it appears that there are still ways for candidates with messages to reach the electorate, and in turn for conscientious voters to learn about the candidates.</span></p> <p><span>Buchanan has understood this fact and used it to his advantage in the early going.  He is the only candidate in the field whose policy stances have gotten through to the public to any degree, and this is in spite of the mainstream media.  Much like Clinton in 1992, he has sought to speak to the American people without the press serving its traditional intermediary role.  The former television commentator and newspaper journalist has been appearing on local radio shows and writing newspaper columns, skirting the media filter which has largely intercepted the views of the other candidates.</span></p> <p><span>Because Americans can't rely upon their press, they turn to C-SPAN, talk radio and MTV specials every four years.  And even Larry King.  If the mainstream media continue to relay information in ways that are less than useful to candidates and voters, then America should totally ignore the networks' game-centered approach to politics.  Hopefully, as the mainstream media suffer bad ratings and lower circulation, the media will get the message that politics is more than a game.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Note to President Buchanan:  Read 'em and Weep | Arts | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Back in November 1994, the Republican takeover of Congress was heralded as the start of a new era.  After half a century of Democratic domination of the House, the Republicans had managed to become a truly national party; they seemed to have a lock on the American electorate.</span></p> <p><span>It is strange, then, to look at the press coverage of the New Hampshire primary, which has been almost unrelievedly pessimistic about the Republicans' chances in November 1996.  None of the frontrunners is considered able to beat President Clinton, who has been decidedly less than popular throughout his term. Bob Dole is too old, Pat Buchanan is too mean, Lamar Alexander is too slick--somehow, the world-shaking gains of 18 months ago seem to have been dissipated.</span></p> <p><span>This quick reversal is less shocking if one looks back to November 1992, two years before the Republican victory--when Clinton ended 12 years of Republican presidential rule, winning back large areas of the South and the precious \"Reagan Democrats.\"  Or one could go back another 2 years, to the aftermath of the Gulf War, when hen-President George Bush had approval ratings in the 90 percent range, and not a single prominent Democrat would run against him.</span></p> <p><span>In other words, American politics for the last 5 years, at least, has been in a state of perpetual upheaval.  That is why E.J. Dionne, Washington Post columnist and pundit, has the audacity to predict a Progressive revival in his new book, <i>They Only Look Dead.</i>  \"They\" are progressives, liberals and Democrats, whose defeat in 1994 Dionne sees as the darkest hour before the dawn.</span></p> <p><span>Dionne's analysis of American politics is simple and original:  America at the end of the 20th century resembles the America of the late 19th century, when the Progressive movement emerged as a great national force.  As it was 100 years ago, America is on the cusp of a massive economic transformation: then it was the rise of industrialism and cities, today it is the \"Third Wave\" of information technology and global markets.  And, as at the end of the last century, Americans are profoundly unnerved by this change.</span></p> <p><span>Clinton's 1992 victory, in Dionne's eyes, was a result of his Progressive approach to the crisis.  Clinton wanted to use government creatively to solve the nation's problems, through innovations like public service, welfare reform, and universal health care.  But the Democrats' failure to make these changes in Clinton's first two years infuriated the \"Anxious Middle;\" as Dionne calls the economically and philosophically insecure middle class; once again, government seemed impotent to address the problems they cared about.  So, in 1994, the same people who turned against Bush now turned against Clinton and the Democrats, in favor of Newt Gingrich's Republicans.</span></p> <p><span>For Dionne, Gingrich's radical anti-government posture is an attack on the legacy of Progressivism, as established by Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson.  The great Progressive belief was that government should be used \"to expand individual choice and protect communities, [in] an effort to improve living standards across the society....\" Gingrich sees every act of government as an assault on freedom; but the lesson of the 20th century, for Dionne, is that government is crucial for preserving individual rights in ways that the market can't do on its own.</span></p> <p><span><i>They Only Look Dead</i> ends with a call for active government efforts for educational reform, universal health care and economic renewal; it's hard to disagree with any of these.  But there is a great gaping hole at the heart of the Progressive program: the budget deficit.  As Dionne writes, \"The federal government now has less and less room in its budget for innovation and useful investment.\"</span></p> <p><span>But Dionne doesn't propose any way to shrink the deficit; like the politicians he criticizes, he is unwilling to admit that a more Progressive society will not be achieved without some sacrifices.  Indeed, Dionne barely even mentions the need for cuts in defense spending or tax increases on the wealthy; that would sound too much like the old, liberal solutions Dionne wants to avoid.  <i>They Only Look Dead</i> makes one feel good about the idea of government; but it is <i>paying</i> for government that drives people into the arms of the Republican Party.  A fairer society can't be fudged into existence with warm, fuzzy phrases about \"Progressivism\" until the nation makes a genuine commitment to paying for it.</span></p> <p><span>After reading <i>They Only Look Dead,</i> one might wind up with a dangerous feeling of optimism about American politics.  The remedy is <i>The Buying of the President,</i> a run-down of all the major presidential candidates' tangled relationships with their campaign contributors.</span></p> <p><span><i>The Buying of the President</i> is not entertaining reading; indeed, it's rarely even well-written, as one might expect from a book authored by a committee, the \"Center for Public Integrity.\"  Instead, it offers a straightforward list of dirty deals, some of them so brazen that it makes U.S. politics seem little better than Italy's or Mexico's.</span></p> <p><span>President Clinton, with the whole federal bureaucracy at his disposal, has the most opportunities to trade favors for cash.  You might remember how, just after the 1992 campaign, Al Gore was enthusiastically promoting an \"information superhighway,\" to be built by the government like the interstate highway system in the 1950s.  But on December 21, 1993, Gore gave a speech announcing that \"unlike the interstates, the information highways wil be built, paid for, and funded by the private sector....\"  Coincidentally, on December 21, 1993, the Democratic National Committee received a $50,000 check from MCI, $15,000 from NYNEX, $15,000 from Sprint and $10,000 from U.S. West.  Perhaps the Clinton Adminstration's telecommunications policy wasn't written in a conscious attempt to raise funds, but that was undoubtedly its effect.</span></p> <p><span>Most of the time, contributions don't go directly to a candidate--that would be bribery--but to a candidate's many puppet organizations.  Thus Archer Daniels Midland, one of Dole's largest lifetime donors, gave $900,000 to the Republican National Committee between 1991 and 1994, plus $200,000 to Dole's PAC, Campaign America, and his think tank, the Better America Foundation.</span></p> <p><span>When you add the $275,000 ADM gave to the Dole Foundation, the senator's charity, and the $500,000 it gave to the Red Cross when Elizabeth Dole became its president, you're talking about some serious money.  Shell games like these allow politicians to raise huge sums without appearing corrupt--over the course of his long career, Dole has received over $47 million in donations.</span></p> <p><span>What <i>The Buying of the President</i> cannot do is prove that policy is actually made in order to win contributions, or in response to contributors' wishes; as might be expected, rich business executives donate to Republicans and labor unions give to Democrats, but these groups have a common ideology as well as a common financial interest.  At the very least, however, the money in the political system limits politicians' freedom of action, disillusions the public about democracy and distracts lawmakers by forcing them to hold constant fundraisers.</span></p> <p><span>More than any of E.J. Dionne's arguments, <i>The Buying of the President</i> shows that there will be no major changes in government policy until there is serious campaign reform.</span></p>"}

Through the phony smiles, phony issues and vitriolic campaigns, the primary system has once again produced a field of candidates that--to put it mildly--is hardly inspiring.</span></p> <p><span>The electoral process is supposed to knock off the pretenders and leave a leader to pick up the banner of the party.  But that's just not the case these days.  While the Republican field has essentially been narrowed to four, half of the primary voters complained yesterday to a New York Times/CBS News poll that they are unsatisfied with the candidates who are left.</span></p> <p><span>Can you really rally around Senator Robert J. Dole (R-Kan.), who told reporters that he had changed his message so often you might call it the \"flavor of the week?\"  The only consistent theme in Dole's campaign is that though he doesn't know what he would do if he were elected, he sure would be qualified to do it.</span></p> <p><span>Or can you rally around a man who tries to hide his views beneath a red plaid shirt?  Former Tennessee governor Lamar Alexander's campaign strategy is to convince the voters that no goodhearted person would vote against a man named Lamar.  And how about Malcom S. \"Steve\" Forbes Jr.?  After all, his father let him run his million-dollar magazine.  The least we could do is let him run the country.</span></p> <p><span>There's only one candidate in this race who inspires any passion.  Love him or hate him (I hate him), there's only one candidate in this field who seems to engender respect from the voters.  And it's the success of his candidacy that explains what Americans hate so much about the other politicians.</span></p> <p><span>Conservative commentator Patrick J. Buchanan's candidacy shatters the myth that money is the key to success in the electoral process, even in a front-loaded process like this year's primaries.  The conventional wisdom in Washington was that the brevity of this year's primary season would favor candidates who could raise money in advance.  But Buchanan's not doing it with money.  He has spent far less money than Dole and Forbes, and even Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) (remember Gramm?), who was one of the first casualties of the season despite his war chest.</span></p> <p><span>Money isn't enough in the campaign because despite what the candidates hope, people aren't trained dogs who slavishly obey their television sets.  Television ads can get your product attention, but if the voters don't like what they see, then they're not going to buy it.  Despite all of Forbes' millions, Buchanan has outdistanced him on his character alone.</span></p> <p><span>For a significant portion of Americans, Buchanan is a leader, and leadership is what Americans want most from their candidates.  The art of leadership, especially in a democracy, is not one of command but of persuasion.  The leader who fails to consider his constituents will find himself or herself abandoned.  A real leader articulates a vision that resonates with his or her supporters.  He provides answers to their problems; he convinces them that he is the man or the woman to execute those plans.</span></p> <p><span>This is the secret of Buchanan's success.  Unlike the other candidates in the pool, he actually stands for something.  He alone convinces voters that he is in the race to do more than get elected.  Are there any other candidates who could honestly claim they represent a \"movement\"?</span></p> <p><span>The other candidates seem to stick their finger out into the polling wind, desperately seeking which way the voters blow.  Dole collects endorsements from the establishment like trading cards as if that will be enough to win.  Ordinary people are not looking for a political servant.  They are looking for someone to articulate a message which they can support.</span></p> <p><span>Buchanan's message is a populist one of resentment, bigotry and reaction.  But it appeals to working class Americans who fear for their jobs and for their future.  The promise of international trade and future growth is lost on those Americans who see their old jobs disappearing.  In this climate men and women look to someone to blame.  A man like Pat Buchanan shows them the way.</span></p> <p><span><i>Steven A. Engel's column appears on alternate Wednesdays.</i></span></p>"}

But New Hampshire residents take their responsibility seriously, and they love to shock the world.  This year's New Hampshire primary campaign showed the best and worst sides of our election process.  Candidates may rise and fall in the coming weeks, but no one should take Tuesday night's primary results for Granite.</span></p> <p><span>Although the New Hampshire primary is always full of surprises, there are some constants.  Every eight years, like clockwork, Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.) descends on the Granite State so that the voters can hand him his hat.  Above all else, this year the New Hampshire results proved the immense weakness of Dole's campaign.</span></p> <p><span>Even with the endorsement of 24 of the nation's 31 Republican governors and a campaign that employs a super-abundance of the top G.O.P. operatives, Dole has been unable to accomplish much other than blowing a 50 percent lead in the polls.  Once and for all proving my old piano teacher wrong, Dole shows that practice most certainly does not make perfect.</span></p> <p><span><b>F</b>irst elected to office during the Truman administration, Bob Dole has just lost the New Hampshire primary for the third time.

Dole has never understood that the presidency is not the prime ministry.</span></p> <p><span>Early on in this campaign, Bob Dole decided that he would rather be to the right than be president.  He backed off from his lifetime of positions on affirmative action, rejected a donation from gay Republicans and signed the same nefarious New Hampshire anti-tax pledge that he had forthrightly and courageously refused to autograph eight years ago.  Now, knowing that the 2004 campaign is something of a longshot for him, Bob Dole is seeing his last chance for the job he knows he deserves slip away.  At this point, he'll be anyone to be president.</span></p> <p><span>So, on the day after the Iowa caucuses, Bob Dole stepped out of the pressurized cabins of the corporate jets that, until very recently, shuttled him across the country, and pretended that he was a certain talk show host from the suburbs of Washington.  \"Corporate profits are setting records--and so are corporate layoffs,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>As senator, Dole has steadfastly opposed any rise in the minimum wage, allowing it to fall to a forty-year low in buying power.  He has tried to curtail the Earned Income Tax Credit, a way to ensure that no parent with children can work a 40-hour week while remaining mired in poverty.  But now on the campaign trail, Dole is nice enough to point out that, \"the real average hourly wage is five percent lower than it was a decade ago.\"</span></p> <p><span>If things get any worse for Bob Dole, don't be surprised to see him wearing Lamar!  Alexander's plaid shirt or Pat Buchanan's brown one.  Even the Granite State results have not been able to shake Dole into coherence.  Still flailing the day after New Hampshire, Dole boldly declared that \"intolerance cannot be tolerated.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>lthough Dole probably will not win the nomination, the real story out of New Hampshire, and potentially one of the biggest stories in American politics, is the victory of Pat Buchanan.  Here in the hallowed halls of Harvard and among the nation's elite pundits, one can hear the chorus of snickers and see the synchronized head-shaking deriding the Buchanan candidacy.  His campaign can all too easily be dismissed by, and might eventually be sunk by, Buchanan's flirtation with authoritarianism, if not outright racism and anti-Semitism.  True enough, Pat Buchanan's success has been a boon to all those who can almost hear the strains of \"Sieg Heil to the Chief\" wafting through their minds as they ease into bed at night.</span></p> <p><span>Yet the vast majority of the men and women who are supporting Buchanan are not racists.  They are scared and scarred by a changing world.  The Buchanan voters are animated by his calls to protect them from an economy that is no longer playing by the old rules.  For all its promise of plenty, thus far, the global Information Age has hurt more people than it has helped.  The growing pains of a transforming world have not been equally shared.</span></p> <p><span>Some have gained spectacularly, but most are struggling to find out where they went wrong.  Commercials for AT&amp;T predict a future where all the amenities of the globe are no further than a computer console.  In the same breath, AT&amp;T lays off 40,000 workers, and the connection between the two seems all too obvious.  The Buchanan voters consider themselves roadkill on the Information Super-highway.</span></p> <p><span>Four years ago, candidate Clinton said, \"People are working harder and harder and falling further and further behind.\"  Unfortunately, that's still true.  Yet until Pat Buchanan started talking about these issues, most national leaders seemed to be clueless about what was going on in America.  Prostrating themselves at the altar of a balanced budget, the politicians in Washington paid little attention to what was happening to the family budget.  Then, Pat Buchanan steps forward to be the \"voice of the voiceless,\" and the peoples' quiet desperation seems muted no longer.</span></p> <p><span><b>E</b>xactly a century ago, the United States was undergoing a transformation from the Agricultural to the Industrial Age.  Populism spread through the farm states like a prairie fire.  In a huge shock, the Democrats nominated William Jennings Bryan who transformed the party and realigned American politics.  He called for term limits, attacked federal judges and harshly castigated the corporations.  The Democrats, in 1896, aligned themselves with a vanishing world, and the Republicans went on to hold the White House for all but eight of the next 36 years.</span></p> <p><span>The new Information Age economy could well be the defining issue of the next generation.  Pat Buchanan's candidacy raises the possibility of a party realignment that would unite those who hold a dim view of the new world (like the supporters of Buchanan, Ross Perot, Jesse Jackson and Ralph Nader) against forward-looking optimists like Bill Clinton and Jack Kemp.  Far-fetched?  Perhaps, but when Pat Buchanan's economics are to the \"left\" of Ted Kennedy's, American politics is ripe for a change.</span></p> <p><span><i>Andrei H.

{"title": "The 'Meaning' of America | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>W</b>hat is the meaning of America?  As I was taught to believe, it is freedom, liberty, opportunity; it is a sanctuary for the \"huddled masses\" escaping political and religious persecution.  Congress, however, seems to be redefining this meaning.  According to the national legislature, the meaning of America is simply being mean--as epitomized in welfare reform.</span></p> <p><span>Reform, as defined, is fixing, improving, exorcising faults.  But as Congress defines it, it is simply change--and in this case, change for the worse.  What the latest version of the welfare bill really institutes is a codification of cruelty.</span></p> <p><span>If this bill is passed as expected, for the first time in 61 years--since the New Deal--there no longer will be a guarantee of federal aid to those with dependent children.  The social safety net will be rent asunder.  Food stamps will be cut by $40 billion over the next six years--cut off after four months to those unemployed without dependents.  Legal immigrants will be denied disability and food stamps.  And as a crowning achievement, Congress has set a five-year lifetime limit on welfare benefits, slashed to two if recipients remain unemployed.</span></p> <p><span>These are Congress' answers to a system that needs an overhaul.  But what are Congress' answers to a child who needs diapers its mothers cannot provide?  <i>Do without.</i>  What are Congress' answers to a child who cannot afford the supplies needed for an already-subpar education?  <i>Stop complaining.</i>  What are Congress' answers to a person who cannot find work despite repeated and persistent attempts and is now without food?  <i>Starve.</i></span></p> <p><span>The current welfare system needs reform; that much is true.  It is a self-perpetuating system, promoting a cycle of dependency.  There are those who abuse it, but this new bill is not the way towards a much-needed change.  Yes, people on welfare should get job training and work.  Yes, they should be made independent.  But Congress' talk of workfare is completely devoid of any mechanism to achieve these goals.  How will welfare recipients magically acquire the skills needed to compete in a market where just 1 in 14 of those who apply for a fast food job get it?  Where will they gain skills when such key programs as JOBS (Job Opportunities and Basic Skills) are being terminated?  Pressed further, how can those with an empty stomach even compete in a competitive job market?  Congress' answer:  <i>they will, or else.</i>  What will happen to those who have surpassed their five-year limit?  Too bad?  It seems just too easy for the government to throw out loose terms like time limits and gainful employment in the name of reform and cutting the deficit by $60 billion in the process when the harsh realities of these so-called reforms are higher infant mortality, hunger, homelessness, higher crime, violence and despair.</span></p> <p><span><b>Y</b>et the deepest problem that welfare faces is not the outrageous numbers it must support or the programs it must implement or even the dollars it must save.  It is the stigma it faces.  People seem to have this image that with enough blood, sweat and tears, one should be able to \"make it\" or at least make ends meet.  They therefore hold a grudge against those who must turn to the system to survive.  The grudge is nurtured by the perception that most of the recipients are black, although the majority are in fact white.  Racism becomes the unarticulated engine that drives the reform.  The welfare system in turn becomes a punitive one.  It becomes a system about punishing those who are seen as lazy, incompetent, as just not good enough.  It becomes a prison sentence almost impossible to escape:  one that is self-perpetuating for generations to come.</span></p> <p><span>What today's reform really is about is not helping those who need it; it is about alleviating the burden from those who provide it.  It is about cruelty.  But when we are cruel to those on welfare, we are, primarily, being cruel to mothers and children.  Thirty-nine percent of the children under 18 in New York City are on welfare.  The number rises to 69 percent in Detroit, for a devastingly high national average, which reveals that 25 percent of all children by the time they reach the age of 18 will have been on welfare; on welfare for an average of not two or five years, but for an astounding 13.  These are children who have not asked to be here, yet children who must bear the burden of their parents' mistakes and misfortunes.</span></p> <p><span>Almost as debilitating as the social stigma welfare must fight is the political cause it has come to embody.  Welfare now is not so much about fixing a failed system as it is about electoral politics, using the poor as pawns.  Four years ago, Bill Clinton promised to \"end welfare as we know it.\"  Just two years ago, he tried to implement programs that would add $10 billion to the cost of running the system; $10 billion in the long-term hope of creating job training and jobs.</span></p> <p><span>Just last year, he vetoed a bill almost identical to today's, after issuing a careful study on its effects which showed that 2.2 million children would become impoverished while $60 billion would be cut from the deficit.  Today, the White House refuses to issue a similar study on a bill Clinton would never conceivably have signed just eight months ago.  Welfare has truly become one of those issues on which Clinton must either break a promise while keeping his principles or keep a promise while compromising his principles.  Not an enviable position to be in.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>hus, in the name of electoral politics, the misuse of the term reform continues.  Few care enough to really understand what reform means; the rest throw the term around because it is the issue du jour.  The term becomes yet another casualty in the increasingly long list of words debased.  Of course, debasement of language is just symptomatic of an even greater problem.  Deterioration of language is synonymous with the degradation of sensibilities as well.  For decades, a deterioration has taken place in compassion, in caring for others in the name of self-interest; look at downsizing, an increase in broken families, a move to the safe suburbs from dangerous cities, the rich getting richer, the poor getting poorer.  So why should a working-class, blue-collar family support a system in which others can live off the government while they struggle to survive?  A deterioration has taken place in the promise made to others across the seas; what happened to \"give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses?\"  I guess no one has looked in a mirror lately, because if they had, they would realize that, unless Native American, we were all on the same boat once.</span></p> <p><span>What this bill really is talking about, in terms very tangible and imaginable, is starvation and homelessness in the name of reform, unemployment and despair in the name of reform, a downward spiral towards devolution in the name of reform and, in the words of Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), a \"social calamity\" in the name of reform.  If this be reform, then give me the status quo.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Welfare Reform In Name Only | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><i>\"If a nation cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich.\"</i> --President John F. Kennedy '40.  1961.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b> bill that will push more than one million children into poverty will not save poor families.  A bill that fails to make work an alternative to welfare is not about jobs.  And a bill that emphasizes budget-cutting rather than assistance is not reform.</span></p> <p><span>President Clinton has spoken repeatedly about ending welfare as we know it--abandoning a system that focuses on eligibility and checkwriting in favor of one that encourages work at decent wages.  On Tuesday, Congress sent the president a welfare reform bill that requires recipients to find jobs within two years and sets a strict five-year maximum for lifetime welfare receipt.</span></p> <p><span>Yet Congress slashed funding for programs to assist the 53 percent of current recipients projected to hit that time limit, and it does nothing to improve wages in entry-level jobs for which those citizens are qualified.  The president should veto this bill.</span></p> <p><span>Long-term welfare recipients are generally uneducated, have little work experience, have young children in their care and are from disadvantaged minority groups.  Any jobs they find will be low-paying ones.  Consider this example:  A single-parent mother in Illinois would collect $7,080 in welfare if she did not work.  In a full-time job paying $4.90 per hour, she would earn only $7,632 after subtracting for taxes, child care, transportation and clothing--and she would lose her health benefits.  Not an easy life, by any means.</span></p> <p><span>A serious reform package designed to move people from welfare to work will entail certain short-term expenses, including provisions for child care and other supports that boost the effective wages of the working poor.  Congress took one step in that direction by raising the minimum wage, which had fallen to its lowest level since 1956.  Now it is taking two steps back.</span></p> <p><span>The current welfare bill, over the next six years, reduces food stamps and school lunch programs by over $10 million, slashes aid for disabled children by $7 billion and cuts the EITC, an income tax credit for the working poor, by $20 billion.  Legal immigrants are barred from receiving benefits at all.  This is no way to help low-income workers help themselves.</span></p> <p><span>The bill also discourages states from offering job training to those needing additional skills.  It changes the funding process and cuts federal welfare spending by $60 billion over the next six years.  Each dollar spent by states today is matched with $3 to $4 in federal grants.  In exchange, the federal government mandates various programs and sets eligibility standards.  Congressional Republicans, however, would shift all funding to block grants, thereby allowing states to scrap any programs and any requirements they choose.</span></p> <p><span>The new formula would give poor southern states like Arkansas or Louisiana less than $15 per poor child per week for all child care, job training, workfare policies and cash assistance programs combined.  Combined.  Richer northern states like New York and California will receive $40 per child weekly, but that still leaves no room for meaningful payments or innovative programs.</span></p> <p><span>An analysis by the Congressional Budget Office concludes that states will receive $12 billion less over six years than they'll need to maintain current benefit levels and job training funds.  Without federal mandates and without money to implement optional state programs, states will save money by throwing recipients off the welfare rolls.</span></p> <p><span><b>L</b>eaving welfare is a process, not an event.  There will be no room for counseling the 70 percent of recipients who lose their jobs within the first year after leaving welfare.  No room for child care support enforcement measures.  No room for subsidized government jobs of last resort.</span></p> <p><span>Worse, Congress defeated a voucher proposal to provide children of time-limited parents with diapers, clothing and food.  Over 300,000 children of legal immigrants will become ineligible for benefits immediately.  \"Many of those on the right privately admit [their] real goal is to end federal spending on welfare entirely and that this is the first step on that slippery slope,\" wrote David T. Ellwood '75, Weiner professor of social policy at the Kennedy School.  Whatever their goal, it's not helping Americans.</span></p> <p><span>Thomas Jefferson once wrote that he \"trembled\" for his country when he remembered that God is just, that He will not withhold judgment forever.  When \"reform\" means throwing families into the streets and starving their children, it's possible that judgment day is nearing.  And when it comes, the blood will run ankle-deep.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Trading Substance For Style | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b>nterning on Capitol Hill necessarily steeps one in a daily flood of political information and expert analysis.  And yet, of the numerous political analysts who attempt to interpret the latest developments and character of the '96 presidential campaign, none have surpassed that greatest of social critics, Shakespeare, in capturing the essence of Election '96.</span></p> <p><span>Shakespeare wrote through a character's voice in \"Timon of Athens,\" \"Every man has his fault and honesty is his.\"</span></p> <p><span>Poll after poll describes an American public at once enamored of Bob Dole's character and integrity and at the same time casting their future vote for President Clinton.  Bob Dole's honesty, the moral fortitude he has cultivated through his many years of service to this country, has now become his Achilles heel.  Every man has his fault, and honesty is Bob Dole's.</span></p> <p><span>To be sure, when 35 percent of Americans in a U.S. News and World Report poll describe President Clinton as somewhat or very dishonest, and 70 percent of Americans in the same poll  characterize Dole as somewhat or very moral while at the same time casting their votes for Clinton, society must be sending a message.  Americans today have either lost their moral judgement or relegated it to the lowest position on the hierarchy of issues upon which they choose their political candidates.</span></p> <p><span>Most political pundits subscribe to the latter rationale.  Their proverbial argument amounts to proclaiming that Dole's advanced age and inability to communicate account for Clinton's lead in election polls.  The same U.S. News and World Report poll substantiates this analysis.  Fifty-four percent of Americans would vote for a candidate with serious concerns about his character but with a similar political bent, while only 31 percent would vote for the individual whose character they respect but whose opinions they do not favor.</span></p> <p><span>Many have brushed aside Clinton's character flaws, proclaiming them secondary to his ability to carry out the office of the presidency.  My political bias aside, this is preposterous.</span></p> <p><span>On the one hand, to assume that an individual's character can be of little consequence to his ability to act is to deny that the decisions that same individual makes are predicated upon his conception of right and wrong.  President Clinton may have had an inexperienced staff.  Indeed, he is entitled to the few honest mistakes which characterize any president's first years in office.  But the endless list of scandals smearing his administration from day one--the honest \"bureaucratic snafus\"--cannot be digested without making the connection between Clinton's character and his maligned administration.</span></p> <p><span>Clinton's questionable character is rooted in his blended conception of right and wrong.   Granted, the scandals have entitled themselves to the exaggerative tendencies of the Republican Congress, but to the extent that they continue to reflect a fundamental disrespect for the offices of our government, they must resonate with an America whose traditional optimism has been based upon the integrity of its citizens and its government.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>he effects of Whitewater or Travelgate reverberate little through American society.  It might be true that Clinton's loose definition of marriage and fidelity has little effect on his ability to carry out the presidency.  But as the seizure of the files demonstrates, there is a definite point where flexible integrity leads to horribly misguided decisions.  With the memories of Hoover's FBI still vivid, we cannot help but attribute the seizure of the FBI files to the lack of morality and integrity within the Clinton Administration--a want which evidently traces itself from the lowest administration employees to Clinton himself.</span></p> <p><span>Americans today have cast integrity aside in favor of oratory eloquence and political craftsmanship, and they remain oblivious to the consequences.  Regardless of whether Clinton was ultimately responsible for the seizure of the FBI files, that the decision behind the seizure was motivated by a thought process valuing use over principle proves that loose ethics and responsibility do not mix.</span></p> <p><span>We cannot call ourselves sane and at the same time convince ourselves that the decision process lies independent of an individual's moral conception.  The notion of ethics is rooted in an individual's ability to have his actions and decisions reflect his moral standing.  And clearly, if we are to have a capable president, one fit to inhabit the most respected office in    the United States, in the world, we cannot delude ourselves into thinking that because he may stand for my belief, he won't amorally sacrifice that belief in the name of political gain.</span></p> <p><span>It baffles my imagination that Americans can so distrust an individual and yet prepare themselves to cast their vote for him.  To be sure, Dole is partly responsible for a poorly-run campaign.  But it is my hope that America has not sacrificed its moral fortitude in the selfish hope that partisanship and political efficiency--and here, Clinton's administration hardly is at home--ought to be given greater importance than a candidate's core integrity.  Trust has formed the core of our nation since its inception and we must not allow it to fall to the wayside in favor of hypocrisy and deception.</span></p>"}

Either the plane went down by mechanical failure, by a bomb or, less likely, by a missile attack.  If in fact TWA Flight 800 fell under its own weight because of metal fatigue or faulty engineering, then my father has it right:  you'd be crazy ever to fly again.  But this seems unlikely.  747s don't just plummet into the sea in a ball of flame because of technical flaws.  Aviation is not a perfect science, but almost all crashes are attributable to some problem not intrinsic to the airplane.</span></p> <p><span>The missile theory has been largely discredited.  Several spectators said they saw a red streak approach the plane before it burst into flames, sparking concern that something like a Katyusha rocket had been fired at the jet.  Investigators have shown, however, that an explosion from a bomb could produce the optical illusion of such an attack as gas poured out of the pressurized cabin.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>hat leaves us with the haunting spectre of a bomb planted by terrorists.  The world, and the United States for that matter, has seen the worst spate of terrorist activity in history, just in the last few years.  The bombings at the World Trade Center and in Oklahoma City shocked a country used to thinking of terrorism as a Middle Eastern phenomenon which occasionally makes a detour through Europe.  Now we have a replay of Pan Am 103 on our own coastline.  If a bomb was responsible, we can safely say that terrorism has been imported to the United States, and where it will stop, nobody knows.  This week, President Clinton unveiled a new package of security measures for the nation's airports intended to protect our passengers and restore peace of mind.  But as we have seen, little can be done to stop a determined attacker, particularly one willing to give his own life for the cause.</span></p> <p><span>Even more frightening is the idea that this was not the handiwork of an established group.  Any major terrorist organization would have claimed credit by now, cashing in the political chips they bought with other people's lives.  There is a twisted sense of comfort in fingering an established suspect.  You feel as if you can deal with them, kill them, contain them, do whatever it takes to stop the violence.  But at least you have that precious commodity, so elusive in terrorist attacks:  a sense of control.</span></p> <p><span>The more likely suspect in this case, however, is some lone mad person, like the Unabomer or some renegade rebels from overseas.  These people are beyond control.  They may have some token demands, but above all, they are about irrational hate.  We can incarcerate them, prosecute them, bomb their native country, and we accomplish nothing.  We can attack the symptoms, perhaps, but we have no cure for the disease.</span></p> <p><span>Modern technology is such that these sick individuals are catapulted to power with a little gunpowder and some simple ingredients.  There are books on the market, often purchased by children, detailing the construction of simple explosives, like the amateur pipe bomb recently found in LaGuardia airport.  There is no escaping these realities; the work of our own hands has come back to haunt us.</span></p> <p><span>Will we ever get a reprieve from this pain, from this madness?  One must hope.  I try to tell my sister that more people die in cars than in planes and that she shouldn't be scared to fly to Chicago next month to visit relatives.  But I don't sound very convincing.  The violence is too real, too omnipresent, too simple.</span></p> <p><span>The blast will fade into the background and life will return to normal.

You get to watch the upcoming Republican National Convention on television.  Those of us in San Diego, on the other hand, are forced to experience it first-hand, with all its inconveniences, headaches and pandemonium.</span></p> <p><span>At times in the past two months, it has seemed that San Diego, a sleepy military beach town of about a million people, has been burdened with far more than any city should have to bear.  At times I wonder, \"What did we do to deserve this?\"  and then I remember, as after a bad dream, that our mayor actually wanted the convention rights.  Wanted the city to spend more than $13 million improving the convention center and filling in potholes.  Wanted downtown commuters to endure weeks-long detours and street closures.  Wanted San Diego on the map.  And all for a lousy four-day infomercial.</span></p> <p><span>It's not the partisan nature of the event that bothers me.  If it were the Democrats, the confusion would likely be the same or worse, since Democratic conventions are traditionally larger than Republican ones--a symbolic statement, no doubt, about the parties' respective beliefs about the proper size of government.  Instead, what rankles is the neverending hoopla that has infected the marina, the harbor and the local news since the Republicans raised their mast at our convention center six weeks ago.</span></p> <p><span>The newspapers (one of which I'm writing for) are filled with coverage of every tiny action, from who's catering the media parties to what the podium looks like.  The Republican National Committee and the San Diego Host Committee have overtaken two floors of a downtown office building, spending about $3,000 alone to rent plants and purchase floral arrangements for the space.  And, in not necessarily detrimental but certainly unusual occurrences, streets connecting the airport to downtown are being repaved, billboards welcoming the GOP fleet are popping up and the homeless are being readied to disappear from downtown's boulevards.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>he benefits of this ruckus are supposed to be grand, according to the official pronouncements.  San Diego will earn a place in the national spotlight (likely prodding every home viewer who salivates over the 75-degree, humidity-free weather to move here).  San Diego's mayor could gain enough name recognition to bid for higher office in 1998 (the Associated Press is even including a profile of her in its media advance kit--Chicago's Richard Daly is not as lucky).  And San Diego businesses will reap untold profits.</span></p> <p><span>The last point, however, is wide open to contention, making many business owners unhappy in a month that in San Diego, unlike Houston, typically brings our largest tourist traffic.  The city has organized two meetings for hotel owners, restauranteurs and parking representatives to alleviate fears that money won't pour in.  Worries and unanswered questions still abound.  As one hotel manager said in reference to RNC preparations, \"We're still being surprised. on a daily basis.\"  About 80 percent of hotel rooms blocked off for the convention have been booked, but many hotels still harbor large vacancies or have not yet received deposits.  And many restaurants downtown are frantically campaigning to convince locals that it's safe to go downtown from 5 to 8 p.m. each night, before the convention proceedings close and the delegates descend upon the Gaslamp Quarter.</span></p> <p><span>Beyond planning, the amount of cash coming into San Diego thus far is not as much as many business owners hoped.  The money comes from three places:  the city, which is investing about $13 million; the Host Committee, which is raising about $11 million; and the Republican National Convention Committee on Arrangements in Washington, which has been given about $12 million by the federal government.  The city and host committee aren't obligated to report their expenses until October, but the Committee on Arrangements has submitted quarterly reports which show that over a year and a half, only about 8 percent of the approximately $5.2 million spent has gone to San Diego.  With the city and host committee totals included, that percentage will likely rise, but these early tallies do not inspire.</span></p> <p><span><b>O</b>f course, the pageantry the Republicans will bring is not to be missed.  And it is exciting to have nearly 30,000 people (nearly half of them members of the media) descend upon our city, attending parties at our favorite restaurants, hailing cabs from our glitziest hotels, ogling animals at our world-class zoo.  We don't call ourselves America's Finest City for nothing, and we look forward to showing Midwesterners, Southerners and Northeasterners a glimpse of California heaven.</span></p> <p><span>But is the hassle really worth it?  Is it worth the press secretaries and out-of-town contractors strutting around as if they own the place?  Is it worth the endless sniping by high-brow media executives about the postage-stamp size of our beautiful convention center?  Is it worth the hundreds of thousands of hours of effort?</span></p> <p><span>I don't know.  But I do wonder where this leaves us, once the Republicans speed out of town with red, white and blue bunting trailing behind them like tin cans on the car of a newly-married couple.  Perhaps back where we started, if a little poorer.  Perhaps leaps and bounds more prominent in America and the world than before.  Or perhaps a little wiser but not well.  It seems the fame could go to our heads, leaving a taste of glamour in our mouths that will sour the morning after Bob Dole's acceptance speech.  It seems we're taking ourselves just a little too seriously.  It's only a convention, after all.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Republican National Convention '96 | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>SAN DIEGO--In celebrating the 25th anniversary of the 26th Amendment granting 18-year-olds the right to vote, the Republican Party has gone out of its way to promote a youthful sense of pride in the organization.</span></p> <p><span>The Youth Pavilion is the campgrounds of the convention's Young Voters' Programs.  A relaxed MTV beach party-type stage lies just outside the convention center, complete with AT&amp;T Internet Services, a Kraft food stand and Sony loudspeakers playing the latest musical recordings.  What more can college students ask for?</span></p> <p><span>Quite a bit.  We seek a platform upon which to espouse our views, not just a playhouse of entertainment.  The one-hour Reality Chat sessions with GOP leaders only whet the appetites of the nation's future political leaders.</span></p> <p><span>We worry about the deficit.  We are concerned that those in the inner city are not being educated or fed.  We fret over student loans and college debt.  We care about our elders and loved ones, but at what cost to our future?</span></p> <p><span>Yet we are not a unified voice, for there are corporation types advocating business tax cuts sitting next to small business spokespeople urging payroll tax elimination.  Minimum wage detractors live next to work-study students.  Young people for and against protectionism come together from across the country, from Alabama to Vermont.  The depth and breadth of ideas reflect the wide array of interests that older Republicans cherish.  If the future of the party rests in its youth, then the 21st century will bring much of the same diversity of ideology that challenges Big Tent Republicanism.</span></p> <p><span>I am encouraged by my peers.  Perhaps not from the clashing of opinions, but from the strength and vigor with which they are expressed and lived out in their communities.  These are civicleaders campaigning for people they believe in; they are young people with visions for the future of America.</span></p> <p><span>The press foresees a smaller and smaller role for the convention in the national news, and plans to reduce coverage in upcoming years.  But I see greater and greater opportunities for young Americans to get involved, to be motivated and awed by the tremendous responsibility that the 26th Amendment confers upon us.</span></p> <p><span>My vote counts just as much as the one cast by Bob Dole or Bill Clinton, the right-wing militiamen in Idaho or the Greenpeace organizers in D.C.  This is perhaps the truest form of equality in America.  And for this reason, the youth of America have the most to gain and the most to lose in each election.  We are voting for our future.</span></p> <p><span>For those who accuse the \"Nintendo Generation\" of indifference, I urge them to speak--or better yet, debate--with a Young Voter.  Ask him or her a political question, and you may very well walk away impassioned with that youthful spring in your step.</span></p> <p><span><i>Joshua L.

Flatley.</span></p> <p><span>Flatley said Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis '68 has been \"very concerned\" that students understand the consequences of underage drinking.</span></p> <p><span>Area liquor vendors said college students do contribute to the underage drinking problem.</span></p> <p><span>\"There's a lot of underage drinking at the University,\" said Jim Hill, who owns Libby's Liquor Market, a Mass. Ave. liquor store.  \"There's a lot of people of age purchasing for people in dorms and houses.\"</span></p> <p><span>Hill said that kind of illegal drinking tarnishes the reputation of liquor vendors.</span></p> <p><span>Alavi said one goal towards which the University and CLAB can certainly work toward is educating students about the negative effects of underage drinking.</span></p> <p><span>\"With the help of the University and their tools we can spread that message most efficiently,\" she said.</span></p> <p><span>Another of CLAB's goals is to step up court actions against underage drinkers \"instead of just a slap on wrist,\" said Richard V. Scali, executive director of the Cambridge License Commission.</span></p> <p><span>According to Scali, CLAB also plans to lobby the state government for laws allowing police to ticket underage drinkers.</span></p> <p><span>According to Flatley, Harvard does not currently lobby the state on issues involving underage drinking.</span></p> <p><span>CLAB was founded in 1993 as the Underage Drinking Task Force but floundered shortly thereafter.</span></p> <p><span>According to Scali, the effort was reinvigo rated in November 1995 when the Hyatt was found to have violated its liquor license that October by allowing a party of 700 Asian American college students at which alcohol was served to minors.  A fight broke out, and several partyers were stabbed.  As part of its settlement, the Hyatt agreed to resurrect the Task Force as CLAB.</span></p> <p><span>Over the past nine months, according to CLAB members, the organization has focused on educating licensees about issues of underage drinking, including recognizing false IDs and responding to specific situations.</span></p>"}

The date of the event coincides with the IOP's 30th anniversary.</span></p> <p><span>All activities at HYPE '96 will be political by nature, including athletic events.  One planned match is a jousting tournament between Republicans and Democrats.</span></p> <p><span>HYPE '96 aims to channel election year political euphoria to \"get students more psyched about Election '96,\" IOP Student Advisory Committee Projects Chair Eric P. Christofferson '98 said.</span></p> <p><span>Christofferson noted that although 99 percent of the IOP-sponsored events are academic in nature, this year the IOP is trying a different tack with HYPE, hoping the carnival-like atmosphere of the event will appeal to all students on campus and perhaps draw their attention to the importance of politics.</span></p> <p><span>\"There is a large population that is apathetic not only in the greater community but in Harvard as well,\" Christofferson said.  \"HYPE is a way to target them.  In order to do this, we've decided to take a more non-traditional approach.\"</span></p> <p><span>Although earlier reports had suggested John F. Kennedy Jr. and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy '54-'56 (D-Mass) might speak or make an appearance at HYPE, neither John-John nor his uncle now say they will be available to attend.</span></p> <p><span>Christofferson said, however, that actual candidates in the 1996 elections (excluding the presidential candidates) would be at the event as well as an undisclosed list of big-name speakers.</span></p> <p><span>Masoumeh \"Massy\" Tadjedin '99, who is coordinating speakers for HYPE '96, was unable to provide a finalized list of speakers Sunday morning.</span></p> <p><span>However, bigger-name speakers confirmed and slated to \"stump\" at the event thus far are Rep. Barney Frank '61-'62 (D-Mass.), a highly liberal, often controversial politician who is up for re-election this year, and David Wilhelm, a former chair of the Democratic National Committee and a current IOP Fellow who will be representing Clinton's 1996 presidential campaign at the event.</span></p> <p><span>The actual MTV \"Choose or Lose\" bus, a mobile voter registration vehicle featured on the MTV news program, will be at HYPE '96, confirmed Christofferson.  MTV will likely film the festival for a spot on the \"Week in Rock\" news.</span></p> <p><span>Christofferson also expects New England Cable News and several local television stations to cover the event.</span></p> <p><span>Rock the Vote, the non-profit voter registration organization which gained fame through its ads on MTV featuring pop celebrities, is likewise scheduled to be at HYPE '96, with its officials manning voter registration tables.</span></p> <p><span>According to Christofferson, representatives from two local radio stations, WJNN Jammin' 94.5 FM and WFNX 101.7 FM, will also attend the event.  These and other groups will be giving away prizes and raffling off spring break trips to students who attend HYPE '96, Christofferson said.</span></p> <p><span>Although no professional bands are yet planned for the event, three Harvard bands have agreed to play:  Flubber, Xosha and Daily Planet.</span></p> <p><span>The main feature of HYPE, however, will not be the entertainment, but the 25 to 35 student groups, ranging from Harvard Students for Israel to Phillips Brooks House, which will have booths at the event, according to Christofferson.</span></p> <p><span>Each group has been asked by the IOP to create a display or some other attraction centered around the political issue they feel most affects their particular organization.  HYPE planners stress, however, that they hope more student organizations will want to get involved once school begins.</span></p> <p><span>\"Without issues, you don't have politics,\" Christofferson said.</span></p> <p><span>Rucker A. Alex '99, who has been in charge of coordinating the student group involvement for the event, said these groups will help illustrate the universal appeal of politics.</span></p> <p><span>\"What we really want is a lot of student participation in HYPE, and a great way to get students involved is to involve the student groups,\" Alex added.</span></p> <p><span>The IOP is providing funding for HYPE '96, Christofferson said, although he added that the IOP has requested advice on logistics and planning from the Undergraduate Council.  Additionally, Christofferson said, the IOP might receive money from the council for HYPE '96.</span></p> <p><span>Rudd W. Coffey '97, a former council executive, has also been involved in helping the IOP with acts for its stage entertainment, Chair of the IOP Student Advisory Committee Avery W. Gardiner '97 said.</span></p> <p><span>In response to questions that HYPE '96 has been significantly scaled back from the grandiose and exuberant plans presented last spring, Gardiner said HYPE '96 is not all \"hype.\"</span></p> <p><span>Gardiner denied the program has been downsized.  \"Nothing's happened negatively.

Milton resident Susan Gallagher, a right-wing third-party challenger, is pulling 2 percent.</span></p> <p><span>Kerry campaign officials are massaging the state's liberal network in its post-Labor Day blitz, while Weld is using frequent media splashes to lure independent and moderate voters across party lines.</span></p> <p><span><b>Partisan Rhetoric</b></span></p> <p><span>Familiar partisan campaign images are the norm in the 10 weeks preceding the Nov. 5 election.

When you go down there [to Washington] the first vote you cast will be for [Senate Majority Leader] Trent Lott,\" Kerry said.</span></p> <p><span>Though Weld is careful not to castigate Kerry's popular liberal principles, he has no qualms with labeling Kerry as a traditional tax-and-spend-Democrat with no sense of fiscal responsibility.</span></p> <p><span>\"John Kerry's Washington has sabotaged us.

The date of the event coincides with the IOP's 30th anniversary.</span></p> <p><span>All activities at HYPE '96 will be political by nature, including athletic events.  One planned match is a jousting tournament between Republicans and Democrats.</span></p> <p><span>HYPE '96 aims to channel election year political euphoria to \"get students more psyched about Election '96,\" IOP Student Advisory Committee Projects Chair Eric P. Christofferson '98 said.</span></p> <p><span>Christofferson noted that although 99 percent of the IOP-sponsored events are academic in nature, this year the IOP is trying a different tack with HYPE, hoping the carnival-like atmosphere of the event will appeal to all students on campus and perhaps draw their attention to the importance of politics.</span></p> <p><span>\"There is a large population that is apathetic not only in the greater community but in Harvard as well,\" Christofferson said.  \"HYPE is a way to target them.  In order to do this, we've decided to take a more non-traditional approach.\"</span></p> <p><span>Although earlier reports had suggested John F. Kennedy '54-'56 (D-Mass) might speak or make an appearance at HYPE, neither John-John nor his uncle now say they will be available to attend.</span></p> <p><span>Christofferson said, however, that actual candidates in the 1996 elections (excluding the presidential candidates) would be at the event as well as an undisclosed list of big-name speakers.</span></p> <p><span>Masoumeh \"Massy\" Tadjedin '99, who is coordinating speakers for HYPE '96, was unable to provide a finalized list of speakers Sunday morning.</span></p> <p><span>However, bigger-name speakers confirmed and slated to \"stump\" at the event thus far are Rep. Barney Frank '61-'62 (D-Mass.), a highly liberal, often controversial politician who is up for re-election this year, and David Wilhelm, a former chair of the Democratic National Committee and a current IOP Fellow who will be representing Clinton's 1996 presidential campaign at the event.</span></p> <p><span>The actual MTV \"Choose or Lose\" bus, a mobile voter registration vehicle featured on the MTV news program, will be at HYPE '96, confirmed Christofferson.  MTV will likely film the festival for a spot on the \"Week in Rock\" news.</span></p> <p><span>Christofferson also expects New England Cable News and several local television stations to cover the event.</span></p> <p><span>Rock the Vote, the non-profit voter registration organization which gained fame through its ads on MTV featuring pop celebrities, is likewise scheduled to be at HYPE '96, with its officials manning voter registration tables.</span></p> <p><span>According to Christofferson, representatives from two local radio stations, WJNN Jammin, 94.5 FM and WFNX 101.7 FM, will also attend the event.  These and other groups will be giving away prizes and raffling off spring break trips to students who attend HYPE '96, Christofferson said.</span></p> <p><span>Although no professional bands are yet planned for the event, three Harvard bands have agreed to play:  Flubber, Xosha and Daily Planet.</span></p> <p><span>The main feature of HYPE, however, will not be the entertainment, but the 25 to 35 student groups, ranging from Harvard Students for Israel to Phillips Brooks House, which will have booths at the event, according to Christofferson.</span></p> <p><span>Each group has been asked by the IOP to create a display or some other attraction centered around the political issue they feel most affects their particular organization.  HYPE planners stress, however, that they hope more student organizations will want to get involved once school begins.</span></p> <p><span>\"Without issues, you don't have politics,\" Christofferson said.</span></p> <p><span>Rucker A. Alex '99, who has been in charge of corrdinating the student group involvement for the event, said these groups will help illustrate the universal appeal of politics.</span></p> <p><span>\"What we really want is a lot of student participation in HYPE, and a great way to get students involved is to involve the student groups,\" Alex added.</span></p> <p><span>The IOP is providing funding for HYPE '96, Christofferson said, although he added that the IOP has requested advice on logistics and planning from the Undergraduate Council.  Additionally, Christofferson said, the IOP might receive money from the council for HYPE '96.</span></p> <p><span>Rudd W. Coffey '97, a former council executive, has also been involved in helping the IOP with acts for its stage entertainment, Chair of the IOP Students Advisory Committee Avery W. Gardiner '97 said.</span></p> <p><span>In response to questions that HYPE '96 has been significantly scaled back from the grandiose and exuberant plans presented last spring, Gardiner said HYPE '96 is not all \"hype.\"</span></p> <p><span>Gardiner denied the program has been downsized.  \"Nothing's happened negatively.  This is one of the number one projects for the IOP this fall.\"</span></p>"}

Dodge said politicians just don't take students seriously.</span></p> <p><span>\"Some of the delegates and representatives are like, 'They're just kids,\"' said Dodge, a reporter for Children's Express, a non-profit organization in which teenagers write news.</span></p> <p><span>Wade said he thinks student activists are very interested in government, citing President Clinton's Americorps program as proof.</span></p> <p><span>\"Our generation isn't as interested in political protest as much as community service closer to home,\" Wade said.</span></p> <p><span>Laurence J. Rescetar, student political director for the College Democrats, said \"students are starting to work inside the parties instead of outside the parties.\"</span></p> <p><span>She contrasted the 1996 Democratic National Convention--which featured a number of students with starring roles inside the convention hall--with 1968's violent clashes between students and police on the streets of Chicago.</span></p> <p><span>There were, however, some protests this year.  Jovenes Rebeldes, a band of high-school age Latinos, gathered outside the United Center, clad in skimasks and bandanas, demanding freedom for political prisoners and an end to the embargo of Cuba.</span></p> <p><span>They stressed they want to be heard.</span></p> <p><span>\"We're just tired of the anti-Latino issues brought up, especially in an election year,\" said a man who identified himself as Quixote.</span></p> <p><span>Another said, \"We want our voices to be heard.\"</span></p> <p><span>When students work within established channels, Wade said, they're a power to be reckoned with.</span></p> <p><span>\"College students, quite frankly, were the difference in electing Bill Clinton and Al Gore '69,\" Wade said.</span></p> <p><span>He said 82 percent of registered college students voted in 1992, the highest percentage of any age bracket.</span></p> <p><span>\"I think young people will be an integral part of this election,\" said Patrick J. Ellis, director of legislation for the College Democrats.  \"I think every election year young people gain a better footing in the process.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"We can no longer be ignored as a political force and groups like College Democrats will highlight that and further empower young people.\"</span></p> <p><span>Mark Nevins, communications director for the College Democrats, said that as college-age voters show their strength in elections, politicians are more and more willing to address their issues.</span></p> <p><span>The White House staff, which is full of youthful staffers, symbolizes Clinton's commitment to energizing America's young voters, he said.</span></p> <p><span>\"Not only are young people being considered as a legitimate interest group but I think that some parties--I won't name names--are taking them seriously,\" Nevins said.</span></p>"}

Bok to protest what they perceived as the administration's neglect of the department.</span></p> <p><span>At the time, Gates, a renowned black literature scholar, was not faring much better.  Then a professor at Duke University, his work was being attacked by many in the community.  He has described the situation as simply \"hell.\"</span></p> <p><span>Gates and then dean of the Faculty Henry Rosovsky negotiated a deal which brought Gates to Harvard, at the helm of the department.</span></p> <p><span>That deal was the catalyst for a tidal wave of change which, in the last five years, has brought an all-star team of Afro-American scholars to Harvard, earned the department national commendations and could place it in the position to affect American social policy on race and welfare.</span></p> <p><span>The plan for all that seems to be laid out on that one sheet of yellow paper in Gates's office. <t><p>The strategy sheet is the result of six months \"sitting at the master's feet,\" Gates says.  He asked Rosovsky \"to teach [him] Harvard culture and how to run a great department.\"</p><p>\"Rosovsky said to have a plan and stick to it,\" Gates says.  \"To keep your eye on the prize.\"</p><p>Many at Harvard--though none publicly--are quick to argue that despite his plan, Gates did none of this alone.  It is the legacy of Bok and Rosovsky, they say, or the work of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences as a whole or the product of recruiting efforts by President Neil L. Rudenstine.</p><p>Regardless, Gates does receive universal praise.  He has, after all, done what he was hired to do.</p><p><b>The Turnaround</b></p><p>This fall, U.S. News and World Report, in its first-ever ranking of Afro-Am departments, placed Harvard's Afro-American literature program first and Harvard's Afro-American history program third in the nation.</p><p>The department had 18 concentrators in 1995, down from a high of 30 in 1993.  This year, Afro-American Studies is offering 27 non-bracketed courses and has 15 faculty members.</p><p>The first line of Gates' sheet reads simply:  \"Stellar faculty.\"</p><p>Under that heading, in Gates' handwriting are listed four names:  \"Anthony Appiah, Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham, Cornel West, William Wilson.\"</p><p>K. Anthony Appiah, now professor of Afro-American studies and of philosophy, came to Harvard from Duke with Gates.  And Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham and Cornel R. West '73 are both professors of Afro-American studies and hold joint appointments in the Divinity School.</p><p>It was West's appointment that really put Harvard's Afro-Am program in the national mainstream spotlight.</p><p>West, a former Princeton professor whose mega-successful books and Baptist-preacher speaking style make him a popular lecturer across the nation, is arguably the most prominent black intellectual alive.</p><p>As a bonus, Gates has brought in author Jamaica Kincaid and producer Spike Lee as visiting professors.</p><p>\"Skip Gates was genuinely someone who didn't want to come to Harvard and be the only star; he wanted to build a stellar department,\" Appiah says.</p><p>And though Gates celebrated his 46th birthday on Monday, his biggest present this year came a few months early when the last \"giant\" on his list--sociologist William Julius Wilson--defected to Harvard this spring.</p><p>Wilson's decision to move from the University of Chicago to Harvard made headlines across the nation.  Wilson--whom Gates calls the \"coup of coups\"--cited two reasons for the move:  Harvard's brain trust of African American thinkers and its politically connected halls.</p><p>And indeed, the house that Gates built at 1430 Mass. Ave. is home to the brain trust.</p><p>But the politically connected halls are closer to the River, at the John F. Kennedy School of Government.  Wilson, although he is teaching an Afro-Am course in the spring, is actually Wiener professor of public policy at the Kennedy School.</p><p>Nevertheless, Gates says that with Wilson's presence, the Department of Afro-American Studies can realize the next (unwritten) goal:  for Afro-Am's stellar faculty to impact national political debate.</p><p><b>Moving Toward Policy</b></p><p>Just a year ago, before Wilson's hiring, the director of the University of Michigan's Center for Afro-American Studies Michael Awkward told The Ethnic News Watch that he was hesitant to praise Harvard's Afro-Am department because it lacked a social science perspective.</p><p>\"Certainly with people like Gates, Anthony Appiah and Cornel West, the department has superb potential,\" Awkward said.  \"But Rome wasn't built in a day.  We'll have to see what develops.\"</p><p>But also on Gates' sheet was a specific strategy:  to first strengthen the humanities end of the department before moving on to the social sciences.</p><p>\"We wanted to build from our strengths,\" Appiah says.</p><p>The Afro-Am professors say the department is nearing the appointment of another sociologist and is searching for a joint women's studies appointment, as well as junior appointments in history and English.</p><p>Gates, who received a MacArthur \"genius grant\" at age 30, has also led fund-raising efforts which have netted more than $11 million for the department--including boosting the program's endowment to $2.25 million.</p><p>Projects in the W.E.B. DuBois Institute for Afro-American Research initiated during Gates' tenure include the Black Periodical Literature Project, a compilation of works in black newspapers and journals; the African Art Database, which contains 20,000 slides; and the Encyclopedia Africana.</p><p>Gates is continuing to work on the development of a graduate program in the department.</p><p>And when the new Barker humanities center is completed, the Department of Afro-American Studies will move from its current location near CVS to plush new offices in the old Harvard Union.</p><p><b>The Future</b></p><p>Wilson's hiring marks the first conscious turn toward social activism.  But some express doubt about exactly how much influence this small, young, humanities-focused department can wield.</p><p>Wilson--even before coming to Harvard--had \"the ear of the President,\" Gates says.  Now at the Kennedy School, Wilson could exact even more influence.</p><p>Wilson \"has easier personal access to the educated media than any other scholar in America....  He's everywhere,\" Professor of Government and Sociology Theda Skocpol said in an e-mail message.  \"He is a major agenda-setter for all aspects of debate about U.S. economic and social policies.\"</p><p>The Kennedy School already has a long list of academics who are active policy makers.  Each election season brings a new round of federal government appointments out of that faculty's ranks.</p><p>Most recenztly, Kennedy School Dean for Academic Affairs David T. Ellwood is a former Clinton administration official in the Department of Health and Human Services.  Kennedy School Dean Joseph S. Nye Jr. also returned from service in Washington.</p><p>Last week, Health and Human Services executive Mary Jo Bane resigned her post and speculation swirled that she will return to Harvard.</p><p>And faculty member Ashton Carter is now serving as assistant secretary in the Defense Department, spear-heading a nuclear disarmament project developed at the Kennedy School.</p><p>\"Influencing public policy is a process that the Kennedy School understands and cares about,\" says Kennedy School spokesperson Steve Singer.</p><p>But Skocpol, who herself has served as a consultant to President Clinton and other White House officals, cautions that making noise in Washington can backfire on academics.</p><p>\"As the Kennedy School experts who went to Health and Human Services to shape welfare policy found out, academics can also end up getting selectively manipulatively used,\" Skocpol wrote.</p><p>\"Some of their ideas--like David Ellwood's two-year limit on AFDC benefits--can get co-opted out of context, while their overall vision--like Ellwood's desire to support work and parenting and 'make work pay'--can get ignored,\" she continued.</p><p>Though Afro-Am has yet to practice politics like the Kennedy School, the department's heavy hitters are well heard on a national level.</p><p>The department now has a sliding scale of famous names.  Appiah says he doesn't consider himself a public figure, while West's voice mail refers \"reporters and those interested in inviting Professor West to speak at a conference\" to his press agent in New York City.</p><p>Gates, who writes six articles for The New Yorker each year, probably falls in the middle as a more public intellectual.</p><p>But Gates and his colleagues say they want more influence on American social policy.  \"If you spend a lot of time thinking about race in America, you can't help but think how things could be better,\" Appiah says.</p><p>Early this year, Gates, West and Wilson, as well as other prominent scholars, attended a series of dinners at the official residence of Vice President Al Gore '69, advising him on race issues for the upcoming election.</p><p>\"This is the kind of thing Bill Wilson does regularly,\" Gates says.  \"I want the department and the [DuBois] Institute to play an active role in policy matters.\"</p><p>Skocpol says such a goal will be difficult to attain.</p><p>\"No single school or department is likely ever to determine political or policy outcomes.  And there is a danger that academics who imagine themselves to be more influential than they are can get used for purposes of window-dressing, especially when contentious issues like race or gender are involved,\" Skocpol wrote.</p><p>And she cautioned that meeting with the vice president is not likely to substantively shape policy.</p><p>\"If [Wilson's] ideas are to make headway ... this depends on building organized progressive networks of ideas and people for a revitalized Democratic Party...,\" Skocpol wrote.  \"The Harvard Afro-Am department can be a part of that, but only a part.  And this cannot be done by focusing on individuals as personal super-stars.\"</p><p>Gates argues that there is precedence for what he and his colleagues hope to accomplish.  \"Some places don't want you to write a book aimed at a general audience,\" he says.  \"But we do.  Harvard has a long tradition of people being involved in the public arena.\"</p><p>Gates says possible goals for entry into social policy can come through participating in the Black Congressional Caucus, forming coalitions with other black policy institutes and producing scholarly research which public officials can turn to for reliable data.</p><p>Nevertheless, Gates and Appiah are aware of their limitations as intellectuals.</p><p>\"We're non-partisan; we have to be.  We're scholars....  We're not a program or a political party,\" Gates says.  \"I can't tell these guys what to do.\"</p><p>Gates describes himself as having \"one foot in the center and one foot on the left,\" while West and Wilson are known as progressives.</p><p>\"There isn't something we want everyone in the department to leave the department believing,\" Appiah says.  \"If people want to listen to us, it's because we've tried to struggle with difficult questions and tried to make sense of them.\"<c><cred>Courtesy of the Harvard News Office</cred></c></p></t></span></p> <p>The strategy sheet is the result of six months \"sitting at the master's feet,\" Gates says.

{"title": "Third Party Blues | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Poor Ross Perot.  Just when he thought he had mainstreamed his campaign by accepting federal funding, the Commission on Presidential Debates shut him out of this year's political faceoffs.  The decision came earlier this week, as the bipartisan committee declared that Perot did not have a \"realistic\" chance of being elected president.  Clinton staffers reacted with dismay even as the Dole campaign was quite pleased.  Both major parties assumed that a Perot appearance would have focused much more criticism on the Republican nominee than on the president.</span></p> <p><span>One can hardly blame the comission, given the criteria they were using.  Perot's star has fallen significantly since 1992 and the general frustration and anger of the electorate has quieted in the last four years.  Without the ability to dig deep into his personal coffers, Perot can hardly spend his way out of his deficit in the polls.  But I can't help but be disturbed by the notion that a man who is on the ballot in almost all 50 states, has a national organization and has political positions on most of the major issues of the day isn't entitled to a national audience.  How are new candidates ever going to break the two-party mold if they can't ascend a presidential podium?</span></p> <p><span>Our democracy is (or at least should be) based on the principle that a free exchange of ideas will ultimately assure that the people make informed and wise decisions.  But that free exchange is only possible in a political system that doesn't handicap challengers excessively.  What is becoming clearer with each election (as Ross Perot has pointed out) is that the current election system allows money to dominate democracy.</span></p> <p><span>Think about it.  How can even the most established and well-respected individual raise the necessary funds to run a campaign in today's medialaden elections?  And even some who have the funds (like Ross Perot) have been refused by the networks when they have tried to buy 30-minute time slots to air their views.</span></p> <p><span>This is not to say that anyone with a campaign logo and a home-cooked platform should be entitled to a national audience as a presidential candidates.  Indeed, the two major parties do ensure that the public is choosing from candidates with a broad base of support and with views on all the big national questions.  It is to say, however, that someone from outside the two major parties who can achieve these credentials should be allowed to stand before the American people as well.</span></p> <p><span>Americans have grown frustrated with the countless advantages given to incumbents, and some have gone down the foolish path of supporting another anti-democratic measure:  term limits.  But what is really needed is an overhaul of the entire system of <i>how</i> we elect people, not just how often we elect them.  Campaign finance reform is desperately needed.</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately, we must rely on one of the two major parties to give it to us, though neither is equal to the task.  For all intents and purposes, the Democrats and the Republicans are both incumbent parties, and the prospect that either will cede some of their own power is dim.  Nonetheless, it is the only way.  In this election year, members of both parties, or at least those that care about a vital democracy, must call on their candidates to take this important step quickly.</span></p> <p><span>Reform is needed not because it will restore substance to the political campaign.  (Andrew Jackson was elected because he was a national hero, not because of any his bold ideas for policy initiatives.)  We need it because it will ensure that all Americans can become involved in the political process not just those that have straightjacketed themselves into the establishment.  Perot's exclusion is no tragedy.  Most people think he has no chance, and he would have turned an important discussion into a three-ring circus.  The principle of his exclusion, however, is alarming, and no self-respecting democrat should forget that.</span></p> <p><span><i>Ethan M.

{"title": "Just Another Harvard Hopeful | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b>was having lunch a few weeks ago in Loker Commons when one of my lunch companions interrupted the conversation abruptly:  \"Did you see who that was?\"</span></p> <p><span>\"No\" I replied casually and a bit alarmed--\"Who was that?\"</span></p> <p><span>\"It was Chelsea Clinton!\" he cried.  \"She just walked by!\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Really?\" another said.  \"Where'd she go?\"</span></p> <p><span>\"She just went up the stairs to Annenberg!\"</span></p> <p><span>It was a mild surprise in an otherwise predictable day, but it passed quickly--the First Daughter had gone in a flash, and the normal pace of lunch resumed.  I doubted that he had really seen her; there didn't seem to be a security entourage any-where.  But it started me thinking--the last I had heard of Chelsea Clinton, she was just a little child about to embark on her adolescent adventures in the public eye.  I remembered the ugly things that had been written and said about her in the press, all those phrases with the words 'pubescent' and 'awk-ward' in them.  Was she nearing college age?  What would she be doing at Harvard?  Surely she--</span></p> <p><span>No sooner had I thought this when there, four feet away from me, was Hillary Clinton--standing starkly in the offensive, hypnotic glare of the LED electronic message board, scanning the menu of Loker's \"bohemian-style coffeehouse.\" She had come downstairs to meet her daughter for lunch.  With her appearance, an underground furtiveness crept into the air as lunch companions quickly hushed and murmured; eyes darted and honed in; people strained to look casual and turn their necks, owl-like, 180 degrees.  A collective concentration fixed in on Hillary, as she stood there painfully aware of her own aura in an airy pale purple suit.  She must not have been very pleased with the luncheon options, judging by the frown on her face--and I must say that I agreed with her:  a chunky, dry ham and cheese sandwich and a bottle of pulpy juice just don't cut it on a humid, 90-degree day.</span></p> <p><span>Chelsea followed, accompanied by some of her friends from home and a couple of Crimson Key guides.  The First Daughter looked up cheerfully at the menu, ordered a sandwich and a drink, and then sat down in one of the polished wood coves with her friends.  Probably not wanting to cramp her daughter's style, the First Lady and another woman sat at a neighboring cove.  It only took a few moments before the Commons was abuzz with speculation, and only a few moments before the group I was eating with--some 'representative' students lunching with a candidate for an administrative position--decided to act as ambassadors.  The Undergraduate Council member, naturally, led the charge.</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>e approached the table with trepidation.  An awkward-looking man and woman dressed in clashing pastel 'Miami-Vice' jackets looked increasingly agitated in their seats.  One of them looked ready to leave her tuna melt and giant chocolate chip cookie and pounce on me, the would-be assassin.  So there's the Secret Service, I thought.  They seemed invisible until you actually looked at them.  I smiled a nice innocent smile and slid past, following our menacing bee-line towards the First Daughter and her luncheon companions.  Having passed the security barrier, Chelsea looked up at us in an encouraging way and waited for our greeting.</span></p> <p><span>\"Hey there,\" began the Undergraduate Council member, we're a bunch of Harvard students and we just wanted to welcome you to the place and say that we really think you'll love it here and we hope you'll come!\"  He was a stellar representative.</span></p> <p><span>\"Thank you,\" she replied graciously.  It was all a bit awkward.</span></p> <p><span>We hovered around the table and chatted a bit.  Sometime when no-one noticed, Hillary snuck out.  We asked where else she was considering applying; she replied shyly, \"Everywhere you can imagine.\" We asked how she liked Harvard so far.  She told us \"I like it a lot.\"  We smiled and gawked and fidgeted and tried to look like Harvard students.  She must have thought we were the most ill-adjusted group she'd ever encountered.  Starved for interesting things to say, I even offered to take her on a tour of University Hall.  That offer was politely declined--she had an appointment at the Admissions Office in a few minutes.</span></p> <p><span>She and her friends polished off their lunches (what healthy appetites!), walked unknowingly by the campus press who had descended on the Commons, and were whisked away to Byerly Hall by Don Johnson and his female counterpart.  On the way out we bumped into the Crimson photographer who had taken a bizarre photo of Chelsea that would make the front page the next day.  It made poor Chelsea look like a cat-cornered mouse, and it earned the eager photographer a kind escort outside and a request not to re-enter.  Funny, she seemed all too happy to smile effervescently with me while a Crimson editor friend captured the moment on Kodak Gold.  Here's the moment.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>few weeks later, Chelsea's bright, beaming face would be broadcast on a jumbotron at the Democratic convention, and a new era of press coverage for Chelsea would begin.  Stories of how she had \"finally blos-somed into womanhood\" and \"come out of her well-protected shell\" would mark the beginning of an image makeover for the First Daughter, and her reentry into public life.  Even Hillary would tantalize the press with the statement that \"Chelsea is dating.\"</span></p> <p><span>But for that brief moment in Loker, Chelsea was--and still is--just one of the hundreds of thousands of talented and hopeful high school seniors who visit campuses across the country looking for a place to fit in and to explore.  She moved cautiously and curiously, trying hard to imagine what it would be like spend four years in this wonderful place--worrying about Cores and blocking groups, going to freshman mixers and spring break getaways, cheering loudly in Tercentenary Theatre on Commencement Day four years from now.</span></p> <p><span>Would she do well at a third-ranked college like Harvard?  I'm willing to bet that she would.  Its elite cachet taken down a few notches to sell magazines, Harvard still overwhelms and excites; it is an extraordinary collection of people and events that is much deeper than any name can conjure, and something that will last much longer than the flow and ebb of reputation and trend.

{"title": "Kennedy:  Goals 1960 | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Last week, I visited the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in Dorchester for the first time, having covered the Republican National Convention in August and hungering for some solid Democratic ideals.</span></p> <p><span>The ride to the museum was a journey in itself, since I had never ventured past South Station on the Red Line T. Emerging from the subterranean maze into open space and ocean-blanched light provided a pleasant change from the cluttered streets near Downtown Crossing.</span></p> <p><span>The bus ride to the museum was similarly enlightening, and a little ironic.  To get to the library honoring perhaps the most quintessential Harvard man in history, you take a trip through the modernist brick architecture of UMass-Boston.  It doesn't quite conjure visions of the Yard at sunset.</span></p> <p><span>But once inside the building itself, an oceanside edifice designed by I.M. Pei, the atmosphere changes.  You examine a series of photographs of the Kennedy clan, realize that Kennedy's senior thesis on British politics became a best-seller, watch an understated 17-minute film about his life through 1960, and then enter the main hall, which showcases mementos, TV footage and documents from July 1960 to November 22, 1963, when Kennedy died.</span></p> <p><span>What immediately struck me in the \"convention hall\" was how similar everything seemed to the gathering I had just attended in San Diego.  The state identification cards were the same three-sided posters encasing a pole.  The pictures showed similarly devout throngs of supporters.  And the \"election room\" footage from the night Kennedy won seemed identical to our modern coverage, except it was in black-and-white.</span></p> <p><span>But as I walked through the hall, I began to notice significant differences between 1960 and 1996.  Kennedy spoke in his inaugural address on a clear, cold January day of a \"New Frontier\"; we speak of lowering the deficit.  Kennedy set goals and started programs that everyone in the country could feel a part of directly or indirectly, like the space program and the Peace Corps; we scale back such programs and look around for more to prune.  Most important, Kennedy, in his famous \"ask not\" quotation and elsewhere, asked the American people to participate in the governing of their country and to make sacrifices for the good of the nation; our politicians believe they must bribe the voters to get elected.</span></p> <p><span>Instead of giving Americans a plan we can believe in, with concrete goals and opportunities for participation, Bob Dole is offering pabulum with a tax plan that could maybe work on Mars.</span></p> <p><span>President Clinton has fared slightly better, with his Americorps program and sadly failed attempt at universal health care, but he has not captured the imagination of a nation either.</span></p> <p><span>Kennedy had the Cold War to spur a nation to action.  We don't have that, but we can create a war on the educational front.  California's Republican Gov. Pete Wilson this year implemented a law requiring elementary school classes to contain no more than 20 students; Clinton should do the same nationally.  He should up the ante on science and math education, selling bonds to support funding just as if we were trying to best the Russians in space.</span></p> <p><span>Clinton could sign the real welfare bill as he has promised, could appoint a professional to ensure that we get universal health care, could make social policy changes the likes of which we have not seen since the times of Kennedy and Johnson.  He must seize the minds and energies of Americans with a plan that doesn't merely patch holes.</span></p> <p><span>Hanging on my wall is a poster from the Kennedy Library of a Norman Rockwell painting titled, \"A Time for Greatness,\" depicting Kennedy's speech at the July 1960 Democratic National Convention.  A president and a country cannot leap to greatness with the support of the people and without clear, positive goals.  That is the challenge of the next president, and that is the challenge of this election year.  Those who doubt that need only visit the library and stare in awe at the ocean through Pei's glass-enclosed pavilion.  That is the awe we need our president to inspire.</span></p> <p><span><i>Sarah J. Schaffer's column appears on alternate Fridays.</i></span></p>"}
{"title": "Presidential Race Offers No Choice | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>N</b>ineteen-ninety-six has been a waste of an election year, primarily because it has not been a contest.  The American voter has been made party to an extended infomercial whose highlights have been the scintillating interludes from the farcical partisan monotony:  Elizabeth Dole as talk-show host, Susan McDougal in chains, Dick Morris in bed.  Despite the political parties' protests that good money is hard to come by, and therefore good information channeling is difficult to procure, Bob Dole, Bill Clinton, and even Ross Perot, have had more access to Americans' time than the stars of \"Friends.\"  Yet the candidates choose to hold the country hostage to their ill-informed and irrelevant multimedia sparring rather than provide substantive debate on the hard question of our national identity.</span></p> <p><span>The conventions were fun spectacles of patriotism run amok, and the subsequent traveling of the candidates wooing working women rallied their respective troops.  But the process makes the U.S. citizen the big loser, for his or her vote is effectively nullified by the lack of a decent choice in the presidential race.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>he Republican Party has chosen to wage its campaign for the executive branch on the very principle of opposition.  What does Bob Dole have to offer America beside himself?  Certainly he has no new ideas.  And the ones he has dredged up from the past are absurd.  Supply-side economics has been ridiculed by every economist except Jack Kemp, and so it was he who made a fine selection for a ticket bound to fail alongside its success-proof policies.</span></p> <p><span>Clinton and Gore continue to run on pseudo-Republican steam:  fighting crime, fighting drugs, fighting the deficit.  They offer sensible government, though not too big, and not too encompassing.  Universal health care has been tossed aside by everyone except the First Lady.  And welfare has been cast off as the failed policy remnants of a prior era, all while selling out the poor and betraying several decades of Democratic principles.  The biggest hope for Democratic initiative in the next four years is a jobs bill which would hopefully correct for some of the externalities of the newer, sleeker American economy.</span></p> <p><span>Ross Perot has presented himself as even more of a joke this year than he did four years ago.  He couldn't even get an elected official in the whole United States to be his vice-presidential running mate, and instead chose a radical and misguided economist named Pat Choate who trades in tariffs and isolationism.  The \"American Revolution\" that Perot launched at Valley Forge makes a mockery of legitimate attempts to forge a third party and offers us nothing but demagoguery.</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>e hope that the upcoming debates among the candidates (whether or not Perot is included) will address hard-core issues important to Americans.  Perot has ruined a great opportunity to expand American democracy.  Dole has disappointed as a viable alternative to the President.  And Clinton continues to govern from the middle, maintaining the status quo.  All we ask for is some dynamism focused on policy rather than public relations.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Barbour vs Dodd | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Haley Barbour and Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) clashed before a mainly partisan audience at the Kennedy School of Government's ARCO Forum Saturday, arguing over which political party is best qualified to lead America into the next century.</span></p> <p><span>As he strode to the dais, Barbour, the chair of the Republican National Committee, was greeted with chants of \"four more years\" from the largely pro-Democratic audience.  Dodd, the Democratic National Committee chair, looked on with amusement.</span></p> <p><span>\"I understand why I am here with 45 days [before the election], but I don't know why Haley is here,\" Dodd quipped, alluding to President Clinton's double-digit lead among Massachusetts voters.</span></p> <p><span>Dodd and Barbour gave opening speeches and then responded to questions from four student panelists representing the Harvard-Radcliffe and the Harvard-Radcliffe College Democrats.</span></p> <p><span>Debate moderator Philip R. Sharp, the Director of the Institute of Politics (IOP) asked about each party's solutions for crime and social problems, and asked for their views on closing society's gap between \"the have's and the have not's.\"</span></p> <p><span>Dodd urged voters to stick with Clinton, asserting that unemployment and inflation are at their lowest levels since 1968.</span></p> <p><span>\"Things are beginning to move in the right direction....  I think we should be looking at which party is best helping to prepare us for the 21st century.  We should look at which party has most improved out quality of life,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>Barbour countered that Bob Dole's 15 percent tax cut would benefit all Americans.  \"We should ask ourselves what do we want the 21st century to be like.  [Republicans] want to push power and money away from Washington and back to the people.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Clinton says the country can't afford to let you keep that much more of what you earn.  We think that families can spend that money a whole lot better,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span><b>Education and Gun Control</b></span></p> <p><span>Both speakers told the audience of roughly 600--which was mostly composed of college students--that their party is the party of education, with Dodd calling increased federal school funding \"an investment in the future of this country,\" and Barbour accusing Democrats of misleading voters.</span></p> <p><span>\"The idea that we are cutting education spending because we are not increasing it as much as [Clinton] is, is a fraud,\" Barbour said.</span></p> <p><span>Barbour, a Mississippi native, said Republicans will reform education by implementing school vouchers.</span></p> <p><span>\"The Clintons and Gores should not be the only ones who live in public housing and send their children to private schools,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>In response to student panelist Seth D. Hanlon '98, president of the College Democrats, the panelists sparred over crime.</span></p> <p><span>Strict punishments for criminals is more important than gun control, Barbour said.</span></p> <p><span>\"We should punish people who commit crimes with guns.  Dole says we don't need the Brady bill.  All we need is a system of instant checks,\" to prevent convicts from purchasing guns.</span></p> <p><span>Dodd replied that the Clinton-backed Brady bill, which imposes waiting periods for handgun purchases, has helped reduce the nation's crime rate by 9 percent.</span></p> <p><span>The speakers also clashed over affirmative action.</span></p> <p><span>Both speakers concluded the 90-minute event by asking the audience to make an informed decision, based in major issues, and Barbour stuck to his guns.</span></p> <p><span>\"Issues and ideas are what shape America,\" he said.  \"I ask you to make the decision based on facts and not based on misstatements of facts.\"</span></p>"}

{"title": "Sensible Campaign Reform | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>F</b>or the past few days The Boston Globe, along with several other leading papers, have put the Dole campaign's \"Aqua-Leisure\" scandal on the front page.  According to diligent reporters, the chair of \"Aqua-Leisure Inc.\" circumvented federal campaign finance restrictions on corporate donations by distributing $40,000 in cash to employees, and then having each of them donate $1,000 apiece to Dole.  As the Federal Election Commission (FEC) starts to investigate, whispers of \"Dole-gate\" stir the press corps.</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps Americans' insatiable craving for scandal makes this a big story.  But even as a citizen deeply concerned about the role of money in politics, I can't help but yawn when hearing these charges.  This is not only because the wholesale influence-peddling that goes on uncommented in Congress and state legislatures is a much bigger story.  More importantly, what difference do the maximum contribution limits really mean for campaigns?  How is the electoral process made more fair if lots of upper middle class people control campaign funding instead of a few magnates?</span></p> <p><span>Of course, the FEC argues that we need these limits in order to \"democratize\" the campaign fundraising process.  Instead of only having \"fatcats\" fundraising for our candidates, all those \"average citizens\" who have a few hundred dollars to spare can determine which candidates will run and get a chance to be heard.  But this is a concept of democratization that would only make sense to someone with the salary of a law professor or a federal bureaucrat.  I don't know a single person in my family or neighborhood who would even think of giving something near a week's paycheck to a political candidate.  And it turns out we aren't all that rare; according to Roll Call, fewer than four tenths of one percent of American citizens have given direct campaign contributions of $200 or more.</span></p> <p><span><b>B</b>ut what if we were able to ensure that everyone had an equal shot at financing political campaigns?  Several constitutional theorists have suggested that such a scheme would be the apex of campaign finance reform.  For instance, in his \"Equal Dollars Per Voter,\" Edward Foley argues that all private funding should be eliminated from campaigns, allowing each voter to allocate an equal proportion of a pool of public financing to favored candidates.</span></p> <p><span>Given the chicanery of many campaign contributors, a scheme like Foley's is tempting.  However, the costs imposed by this regime are high as well.  Could the government fairly ensure that no private money is spent?  And what if some philanthropist made a good faith effort to inform individuals about the candidates--should her efforts be circumscribed?</span></p> <p><span>It's relatively clear that the answer to both questions is no.  But the reasons why are a bit complex, and help us to understand some deeper issues surrounding reform.  I was first alerted to these issues during a personal conversation I had on the subject of reform, so it might be worthwhile to relate it.</span></p> <p><span>Given that 1996 is an election year, I have often discussed the current system of campaign financing with others.  The usual exchange involved some mutual laments about the demoralizing nature of present campaigns, a few comments on the feasibility of given reforms and a brief evaluation of current political leaders.  Whenever I spoke with a fellow \"liberal,\" we always talked about how best to ensure the \"equal influence\" of all people, rich and poor, in governmental policy.  But one of the conversations broke this mold, and helped me see the problems with an \"equal influence\" paradigm of reform.</span></p> <p><span><b>O</b>ne day, when I was walking with a woman to the Cambridge Court House, she happened to ask me about my studies, and what might improve the current system of financing campaigns.  I decided to cut right to the chase, saying, \"The only solution is complete public financing; without it, corporations will always have more power than us.\"  She assented, and we talked for a short while about the various scandals we had heard of.  But then she added, \"I just wish I knew what the candidates stood for.  Like just a page each day in the paper would be enough.  Or some time on the news.\"</span></p> <p><span>Her comment nearly stopped me in my tracks.  She had made an essential point; political campaigns should not be understood solely as distributions of power but also as forums for reasoned deliberation.  Yet here I had tried to think out the problem from start to finish, to present a clear and simple explanation intelligible to the \"lay person.\"  Precisely because I sought to present simple and compelling advocacy for reform, I overlooked a fundamental justification based on the nature of campaigns themselves.</span></p> <p><span>I believe that campaign finance reformers could develop far more compelling programs for reform if they took the \"participation/deliberation\" distinction seriously.  The \"equal influence\" paradigm of reform automatically posits a divergence of interests between different parts of the electorate.  By calling reform an opportunity for \"fair deliberation,\" the emphasis is less on controversial schemes of distribution than on opportunities for consensus-building.  With this model of reform in mind, reformers could attack distortions like thirty-second attack ads and \"push-polling\" through which the right does much of its \"dirty work.\"  And they would not merely be looking at campaign finance reform as an instrument to achieve one particular political program, but as an end in itself for assuring the legitimacy of all governmental decisions.</span></p> <p><span><b>P</b>erhaps John Dewey, the greatest American \"philosopher of democracy,\" described a deliberative style of politics best when he insisted that \"Majority rule, just as majority rule, is as foolish as its critics charge it with being...The means by which a majority comes to be a majority is the more important thing:  antecedent debates, modification of views to meet the opinions of minorities, [and] perfecting processes of inquiry.\"  Writing in the late 1920s, when many authors questioned the viability of democratic processes, Dewey discerned the preconditions for reform:  \"The essential need, in other words, is the improvement of the methods and conditions of debate, discussion, and persuasion.\"</span></p> <p><span>Too often hidden in the shadows of more traditional rights claims, the issues raised by campaign finance reform ultimately revolve around the fundamental purpose of political participation.  If they wish to demonstrate that governmental regulations can contribute to this purpose, reformers ought to make participation as deliberation, as a reflective exercise in collective autonomy, their watchword.</span></p> <p><span><i>Political campaigns should be forums for reasoend deliberation.</i></span></p>"}
{"title": "Freedom of Choice | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Every day, innocent people who have wronged no one are killed.  This occurs every day, in hospitals all across America.</span></p> <p><span>And every day, women exercise their reproductive freedom and their right to privacy and terminate their pregnancies through abortion.</span></p> <p><span>Same event, two descriptions.  That's the problem with the abortion debate in America.  Essentially, it boils down to a conflict of beliefs.  Unlike other social issues that center around policy differences, abortion, at its heart, is an issue of faith.</span></p> <p><span>When liberals and conservatives disagree over welfare, compromise is possible because no fundamental principle is at stake.  Abortion is different.  Is a fetus a human life?  If you believe it isn't, a world of social policy possibilities opens up before you.  If you believe it is and you don't scoff at the sanctity of human life, you are in a quandary.</span></p> <p><span>Though decidedly pro-choice myself, I have always understood hard-core pro-lifers.  My beliefs tell me that the fetus is more than a heap of placental tissue but by no means a full human life.  Therefore, I have the luxury of supporting mothers' \"reproductive freedom\" and a woman's right to choose.</span></p> <p><span>But anti-abortion activists believe that a fetus is as human as you and me.  Abortion for them is murder, plain and simple.  And Medicaid funding of abortion is nothing less than state-sponsored execution.  If you believe that, how can you not picket abortion clinics and fight for a Constitutional amendment?  If murder is happening in America's hospitals every day, how can you not fight to stop it?</span></p> <p><span>Pat Buchanan actually talks some sense when he refuses to consider exceptions in the cases of rape or incest.  If the fetus is a human life, then its survival trumps everything else, except the life of the mother.  The circumstances under which it was conceived are irrelevant.  As Buchanan's campaign manager was quoted a few days ago in The New York Times, \"You wouldn't say that you could kill a 1-year-old child because it was conceived in a rape.\"</span></p> <p><span>It is this crisis of faith that makes the recent debate within the Republican party so interesting.  Pro-choice Republicans have been making noise lately, arguing that they should not be silenced.  Currently the party platform is explicitly pro-life and leaves no room for dissent.</span></p> <p><span>But Governors Weld, Whitman and Pataki, displaying either political principle or electoral pragmatism, have vowed to modify the platform to include pro-choice politicians like them.  Weld is now pressuring the party to appoint new, pro-choice delegates to represent Massachusetts at the Republican convention this summer.  He hopes to garner support for a more open, tolerant platform.</span></p> <p><span>Will these dissenters succeed?  It depends on what most Republicans believe about abortion.  Do most really believe that abortion is fundamentally equivalent to murder and that compromise is ethical surrender?  I doubt it.  There are those that do, and those people are the ones who set up counseling services for pregnant teenagers and help parents of unwanted children find foster families.  They see abortion as a moral dilemma, not as a chance to villify the poor.</span></p> <p><span>But for many Republicans, abortion is merely one of a host of issues--the death penalty, school choice, flag-burning--that supposedly stand for a commitment to values in the face of moral decay in America.  These people, Bob Dole among them, don't believe in the sanctity of the human fetus, and they compromise in the cases of rape and incest.</span></p> <p><span>The moderate wing of the party finally has had the good sense to expose the hypocrisy of that position.  Once the issue of life is gone, no one in good conscience can support antiabortion legislation that hurts the poor alone.  Either you believe a fetus is human or you don't.  If most Republicans have their doubts, they should have the freedom of choice--to take a more liberal stance on abortion.</span></p> <p><span><i>This is Ethan M.

His campaign advisers will almost assuredly convince him that he has little chance in November in this bastion of the Democratic Party, making campaigning here virtually useless.</span></p> <p><span><b>A Heated Senate Race</b></span></p> <p><span>While the presidential race may not be close in Massachusetts, this year's Senate race in the Bay State is shaping up to be as intense as a Yankees-Red Sox series during a late September pennant race.</span></p> <p><span>In an election where one-third of the Senate seats are up for grabs, the battle between Democratic junior senator John F. Kerry and present Gov. William F. Weld '66 is the most high-profile race in the country.</span></p> <p><span>A Weld win here would cement the Republican hold on the Senate and add credence to the belief that even in this traditional Democratic stronghold, conservatism is on the rise.</span></p> <p><span>Weld, a former Adams House resident, has been remarkably popular as a Republican governor in the Bay State, easily winning re-election against his Democratic challenger in 1994.</span></p> <p><span>The governor is known for blending social liberalism--he is prochoice and is unwavering in his support for gay rights--with a tough fiscal conservatism, advocating tax cuts and an overhaul of the welfare system.</span></p> <p><span>In the early days of the race, Kerry, buoyed by his recent marriage to multi-millionaire Theresa Heinz, the heir of the Heinz ketchup fortune, easily out-spent Weld and jumped to the early lead.</span></p> <p><span>However, during the last couple of months, Weld has climbed back into the race and has matched his opponent's fundraising.</span></p> <p><span>The two have planned a series of debates running through the summer and into the fall.</span></p> <p><span>The first, held April 8 at Faneuil Hall, saw sparks fly between the two politicians.  Kerry, himself a Yale graduate, jumped on the offensive early and attacked Weld's plan to overhaul the welfare system.</span></p> <p><span>\"You spend more time beating up on welfare recipients than you do on finding plans to cover them,\" Kerry said.</span></p> <p><span>The candidates also sparred over the death penalty, with Weld supporting the measure and Kerry opposing it.</span></p> <p><span>\"Kerry voted against the death penalty for cop killers,\" Weld said.</span></p> <p><span>The two candidates contended again this week and will continue to debate throughout the summer as each vies for the chance to represent Massachusetts in the Senate.</span></p> <p><span><i>--David L.

{"title": "Diversity Debate:  Rudenstine Speaks and Mansfield Strikes Back | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>President Neil L. Rudenstine renewed a longstanding debate among Faculty members earlier this year with two public statements in support of affirmative action.</span></p> <p><span>Rudenstine wrote an open letter last April defending affirmative action in the face of <i>Hopwood v. Texas,</i> the United States Court of Appeals decision forbidding the University of Texas from considering race or ethnicity in its admissions decisions.</span></p> <p><span>Rudenstine objected to the court's decision, saying that \"student diversity contributes powerfully and directly to the quality of education in colleges and universities.\"</span></p> <p><span>He continued by arguing that measures other than the traditional criteria of test scores and grade must be used in evaluating applicants.</span></p> <p><span>\"[Harvard takes] great care not to view people simply as the sum of their grades and test scores,\" Rudenstine wrote.  \"We view applicants as individual human beings with a complex set of talents, qualities, interests, backgrounds and experiences.\"</span></p> <p><span>The public letter came on the heels of Rudenstine's 58-page report in January to the University's Board of Overseers titled \"Diversity and Learning.\"</span></p> <p><span>While he does not defend rigid quotas for minority applicants, Rudenstine strongly supports Harvard College's current policy of considering race or ethnicity as a \"plus factor\" in college admissions.</span></p> <p><span>Kenan Professor of Government Harvey C. Mansfield '53 blasted Rudenstine and the report for endorsing a policy which he said sacrifices academic excellence in the pursuit of diversity.</span></p> <p><span>Once race was considered as a factor, Mansfield wrote on the editorial page of The Crimson and in an article published in The Weekly Standard, Harvard began accepting applicants of poorer academic standing.</span></p> <p><span>\"[There] is one big difference [Rudenstine] does not mention:  the stubborn and unwelcome fact that blacks do not perform as well as other groups on standardized tests,\" Mansfield wrote.  \"It is certainly unwelcome, and all the more because the difference is not small.\"</span></p> <p><span>Days after Rudenstine's letter about Hopwood was released and Mansfield's article was published, Rudenstine's arguments were attacked in a meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS) by professors who claimed Harvard's policy of affirmative action encouraged students and professors to play \"ethnic politics.\"</span></p> <p><span>Mansfield claimed Rudenstine's annual report was anything but apolitical.</span></p> <p><span>\"Harvard has jumped with both feet onto one side of this political debate,\" Mansfield said during the meeting.</span></p> <p><span>\"We're more liberal than Clinton, who wanted to amend, not end, affirmative action,\" he wrote in The Crimson.</span></p> <p><span>Rudenstine forcefully ended the hour-long debate with an uncharacteristic show of emotion, defending his position as thoughtful and well-reasoned.</span></p> <p><span>The document examines diversity from a historical context, invoking theories of John Locke and J.S. Mill who, Rudenstine writes, emphasized the value of diversity of ideas in creating the best possible educational environment.</span></p> <p><span>It then cites the efforts of past Harvard presidents Charles W. Eliot, Class of 1853; A. Lawrence Lowell, Class of 1877 and James B. Conant '14, all of whom sought to diversify Harvard by recruiting students of different geographic, ethnic and, eventually, racial backgrounds.</span></p> <p><span>\"I don't think I am playing ethnic politics,\" said Rudenstine, emphasizing each word by pounding on the table.</span></p> <p><span>\"I went to John Stuart Mill, President Eliot and writers of the 19th century precisely to avoid bringing politics into the debate.\"</span></p> <p><span>Although he conceded in an interview the next day that diversity could be seen as a political issue, Rudenstine said he approached the topic solely from an academic angle.</span></p> <p><span>The president also lauded the debate as being \"exactly what a faculty meeting means.\"</span></p> <p><span>Rudenstine said all citizens agree on the importance of diversity, but they differ over the proper means of fostering it.</span></p>"}

Raines' speech opposing the use of police against the 1969 student rioters drew an ovation from the audience and was widely considered the most effective and eloquent speech delivered at that historic meeting.</span></p> <p><span>Raines' friends predicted he would be the first black president of the United States and often held late-night discussions about how to allocate cabinet positions among themselves when that happened, Howard says.  Raines' election by his peers as first marshal of the Class of 1971 is further evidence that he was held in high esteem by all.</span></p> <p><span>And even today, the prospect of a Raines presidency is not unrealistic, given Raines' \"remarkable thoughts, perspective and background that he brings to a situation, and the apparent effectiveness of his approach to a variety of situations,\" says Jeffrey Nebel '71, who roomed with Raines for four years in college.</span></p> <p><span>Raines' opportunity to work in Clinton's cabinet as director of the OMB is thus not surprising to his friends.  Leeland Cole-Chu '71, another four-year roommate, credits Raines' recent nomination to his dedication to public service, high energy, incisiveness of thought and speech and honesty.</span></p> <p><span>\"That combination was bound to carry him to wherever he wanted, which in his case is a reasonably secure lifestyle in public service,\" Cole-Chu says.</span></p> <p><span>Nebel also stresses Raines' tremendous commitment to public service throughout his academic and post-academic careers.</span></p> <p><span>The financial hit that Raines will take to assume the OMB position is indicative of his strong motivation toward public service, Nebel says.</span></p> <p><span>Raines' earnings last year at Fannie Mae totalled $2.25 million, according to various news reports.  His new post will net him $148,000 per year.</span></p> <p><span>Interestingly, Raines, Nebel and Cole-Chu held a \"boys' weekend\" together at Raines' country home in Pennsylvania that coincided with the weekend of Raines' nomination announcement.</span></p> <p><span><b>Sterling Career</b></span></p> <p><span>After receiving an A.B. in government from the College, Raines continued to impress.  He won a Rhodes Scholarship to attend Magdalen College at Oxford and went on to earn a J.D. from Harvard Law School.</span></p> <p><span>After finishing his formal education, Raines began a long and distinguished career in public service.  Between 1977 and 1979, he served in the OMB as associate director for economics and government and as assistant director of the White House policy staff under the Carter administration.</span></p> <p><span>More recently, Raines was part of a transition team for Clinton, heading clusters involving finance and international trade.  He also assisted Vice President Al Gore '69 with the National Performance Review, an effort directed at streamlining and improving the efficiency of government.</span></p> <p><span>Following his tenure in the Carter Administration, Raines joined and became the youngest partner of the investment banking firm of Lazard Freres &amp; Co.  He currently serves as the vice chair of Fannie Mae, and he is credited with moving the agency into the technological future.</span></p> <p><span>In addition to his current position at Fannie Mae, Raines serves on the Board of Directors of Pfizer Inc. and The Boeing Company.  He is Chair of the Visiting Committee of the Harvard Kennedy School of Government and was the former president of the Board of Trustees of the German Marshall Fund of the United States.</span></p> <p><span>When asked the secret of his success, Raines says he abides by two mottoes in his endeavors:  \"Luck is preparation meeting opportunity;\" and \"Live your life with the expectation that one day it will be printed on the front page of the New York Times.\"</span></p>"}

Harvard boiled over and changed forever between registration week in 1967 and commencement day in 1971.  To be there then was to be in fast-forward almost every moment.  I don't remember ever going to sleep.</span></p> <p><span>The Harvard at which we initially arrived is all but forgotten now, with its <i>de facto</i> segregation by gender, class and (to the extent there was minority representation) race.  As a graduate of a middle-class public high school, I was assigned demographically similar roommates in the Yard; the wealthier prep school boys also kept to themselves, on their way to the final clubs the rest of us never entered.</span></p> <p><span>All young Harvard men, rich and poor and (mostly) in between, were expected to regard women as The Other.  'Cliffies were sequestered far from the Square and, under \"parietals\" (is this word still in the language?), could visit our rooms only a few inconvenient hours per week.</span></p> <p><span>This Harvard, where Radcliffe teas (with actual tea) were taken seriously as a subliminal erotic ritual and where no one thought twice about putting on ties and jackets for lunch or class, started to implode by the spring of our first year.  By then it was 1968, which brought in rapid succession the Gene McCarthy campaign, the Martin Luther King and Robert F. Kennedy '48 assassinations and, finally, during summer vacation, the Democratic convention in Chicago at which many college kids who looked like us (and in a few cases actually were us) fell under the brutality of <t>Richard Daley's storm troopers.<p>The Vietnam War, which more and more at Harvard protested with rising rage, now found its correlative in political violence at home.  How long could Harvard remain immune to the national cataclysm?</p><p>Only a few months, it turned out.</p><p>In sophomore year, you could feel the tension grow, as if Cambridge were at the eye of a storm about to break.  When the explosion arrived in April 1969, it took the form of cops marching into the Yard to clear University Hall of the protesters who occupied it.</p><p>I observed the battle as a Crimson journalist--journalism provided a safe haven for some of us unwilling to choose among the rigid ideologies of Harvard's myriad anti-war factions.</p><p>As helmeted police officers, seemingly emulating their Chicago prototypes, beat screaming students with their billy clubs repeatedly just for the pleasure of it in the flat silver light of daybreak, an illusion was smashed.  Harvard would no longer be an ivy-covered sanctuary in an America that was coming apart.</p><p>Nathan M. Pusey '28, the Harvard president who called in the cops, was caught by surprise by the breadth and intensity of the ensuing revolt.  He did not calculate that the war, not to mention the drug culture it exacerbated, had shattered much of the rigid social segmentation of Harvard tradition.</p><p>When the police clubbed protesters, they were not targeting solely an isolated radical fringe that could be excised from the rest of the student body like a cancer.  Anti-war rage was a powerful leveler, cutting across all Harvard class lines.  As one eyewitness wrote, the University Hall occupants included \"some people from the Loeb, a couple of guys from the Fly Club, at least one from the Lampoon and one in a tuxedo who just came from a party and was drunk.\"</p><p>So wide was the reach of The Bust, as it immediately was known, that it brought the normally fractious Harvard community into rare unity.  A Soldiers' Field rally of 11,000 students and faculty produced a strike.  Classes turned into floating picnics; strike T-shirts and arm bands entered the realm of high fashion; and nightly political meetings of Politburo duration became the after-dinner activity of choice.  For some, there might be dancing 'til dawn, with drugs and sex in abundance.

Tenured faculty in love beads distributed Maoist literature in the Square; a white-haired gentleman known only as \"Mr. A. Nony Mous\" took countless cryptic full-page ads in The Crimson to promote a cause he called \"All Students for a Goodness Society,\" a sectlike group of protesters from Columbia Teachers College stage a nude-in in a House laundry room.</p><p>The non-stop circus, with its even more bizarre array of characters and sideshows, continued until we graduated, accelerating in madness with the invasion of Cambodia and the killings at Kent State.

Most of the elements in the contract have now been halted in their tracks and there is even talk of disunity within the ranks.</span></p> <p><span>The hot strategists in Washington today are those who are blowing with the wind.  Nowadays, there is no serious talk of liberal values versus conservative values.  Suddenly, there is a whole new breed of politician being born inside the beltway which is neither liberal nor conservative--it is the platypus-like centrist.</span></p> <p><span>A platypus is an animal with some duck-like and some beaver-like properties, but it is neither.  Similarly, if one plays close attention, in the past few months Bill Clinton and Bob Dole, have subtly shifted their positions and have begun to sound very much unlike their predecessors or even themselves just a few years ago.  In the last few months, the two candidates have increasingly displayed their proclivity to say anything, do anything to please the voters.  While such malleability is not necessarily a new phenomenon in the American elections, what sets this election apart is the fact that the volatile circumstances under which the election is being held are unique.</span></p> <p><span>For one thing, at the national level the disparity between rich and poor is increasingly felt across the country, resulting from the unchecked avarice of the wealthy and their apparent lack of compassion for the poor who are reacting with disguntlement.  The business sector is bigger, stronger and more intrusive in people's lives than at any time in America's history.  Ethnic and racial tensions are also rising.  Internationally, for the first time in this decade, the United States is confronted with the prospect of a possible menace from the East.  In such an unpredictable world, an astute president with a keen sense of the urgency of the moment and with a steady hand is needed more than ever.  By this, I mean a president who has clear and spelled-out convictions, one who has a sense of direction and purpose.  We need a president with a mission, who is not afraid to disagree with those who are not serving the country's interests.  The candidate must have a platform, a plan for the future of America, not just fancy words for TV sound bites; the candidate must deal in specifics.  Instead, alas, what we are being presented with are the usual tailored-for-election candidates whose only immediate objectives are to emerge victorious on November 5.</span></p> <p><span>The electorate is led to believe that there is a real contention between the two candidates; some even believe that the election is a contest between right and wrong where their votes would dispel the evil and restore the good.  The voters are further assured that once they vote for one candidate, the other candidate's views, the much-reviled one, will not be represented.  Unfortunately however, the reality on the ground suggests otherwise.  The fact is that the two candidates are vying for the throne for the same reasons as any two different executives of a corporation compete for the top position.  While their strategies may differ greatly from each other, the outcome of the election does not necessarily steer the government in a different direction.  Indeed, it is helpful to realize that the two parties are simply branches of the same strand--they are not separate, opposite entities as the voters are led to believe.  Indeed, no matter which man gets elected, especially in the short run, the public would hardly be able to distinguish between their actions.</span></p> <p><span>The president is inevitably the nation's No. 1 political boss.  Yet he is, at the same time, if not in the same breadth, the leader of public opinion.  Those who administer our physical life, also administer our spiritual life.  He is, in Woodrow Wilson's words, \"the spokesman for the real sentiment and purpose of the country.\"  He is thought of by people as a combination of scoutmaster, Delphic oracle, hero of the silver screen and father of the multitudes.  The framers of the Constitution took a momentous step when they fused the dignity of a king and the power of a prime minister in one elective office--when they made the president a national leader in the mystical as well as the practical sense.  With that in mind, Bill Clinton was elected to the presidency in 1992 as a \"New Democrat,\" stressing responsibility as well as rights.  What set him apart form Democrats such as Michael Dukakis, Walter Mondale and Jimmy Carter had less to do with his stand on particular issues than with his ability, at least at moments, to transcend the terms of the conventional politics.  Dukakis learned what happens to a Democratic nominee who runs with a Liberal label.  When he told the 1988 convention that the election would be about \"competence,\" not \"ideology,\" Republicans pounced.  Clearly, Clinton, too, thought that his liberalism was a handicap and hence he tried to change the outcome by changing his approach.  He talked about the breakdown of family and urged people to begin by changing \"from inside out,\" changes that reach \"the values, the spirit, the soul.\"  In reality, however, Mr. Clinton was a charter New Democrat and has governed as one since the opening bell.  His administration moved to the right on nearly every core economic issue since taking power.  Think of it as \"putting corporations first.\"  He has preferred the financial markets over working people in his budget package although ostensibly he defends their rights.  He has allowed insurance companies, not the consumers, to set the pace in the health care debate, and he has preferred multinational corporations over everyone in the trade agreements.</span></p> <p><span>Although, to be fair, we should acknowledge that by catering to corporate America in this way, Mr. Clinton had hoped to gain running room for an activist agenda on health care, the environment, national service and the like, but unfortunately that strategy has been less than successful.</span></p> <p><span>Lately the two men, Clinton and Dole, try to sound more and more like each other, and at times, each tries to outdo the other by being the first to embrace the radical ideas of the other party.  For example, Bob Dole talks about allowing pro-choice activists to participate at the Republican Convention, while Bill Clinton, who championed the cause for gays in the military, suddenly voices his opposition to gay marriages, and embraces Republican ideas as they become prominent.  The fact is that both sides are pandering to the voters, hoping that citizens will believe them long enough to vote for them in November.</span></p> <p><span>Since each man is simply trying to outwit the other by appearing to be all things to all people, consequently, in this election, more than the previous ones, ideology has been supplanted by opportunism.  Accordingly, the two candidates' ideologies, it seems, have become as malleable as clay in a the hands of a child who can shape it as he wishes.  What is worse, however, is the fact that we are being presented with a superficial facade intended for the public's consumption--while underneath, the candidates' views have not essentially changed.  They have simply become ambiguous.</span></p> <p><span>Alexander Hamilton once wrote:  \"The true test of a good government is its aptitude and tendency to produce a good adminstration.\"  To this end, the presidential candidates should be seriously concerned with the core needs of the American government whose only objective must be to serve the interests of the nation.  The next president should have the ability to reverse the tide of the last few decades where the political agenda has been mainly concerned with adjudicating the roles of market and government without addressing the loss of community and the erosion of civic life.  The presidential candidates would be wise to pay attention to these needs regardless of their party inclination.  They should heed the call of well-meaning individuals like former U.S. senator Bill Bradley, who called for a politics that focused more on the institution of civil society.  Neither the market nor government is \"equipped to solve America's central problems, which are the deterioration of our civil society and the need to reviatlize our democratic process,\"  he writes.  Politics should be concerned, he urges, with restoring \"churches, schools, fraternities, community centers, labor unions, synagogues, mosques, PTAs, libraries and barbershops\" as \"civic spaces,\" sites of deliberation about the common good.</span></p> <p><span>The Republican Contract With America offered a panacea for the country's ills; and President Clinton, with his vaunted political instincts, adopted the most salient elements of the panacea.  Now the Democrats are trying to further counter the Republicans with their plan, which they call Families First.  Moreover, by declaring wars on poverty, drugs, three strikes and you are out slogans etc., by putting 100,000 more police officers on the street, the president as well as his adversaries are hoping to address America's social ills.  The problem is that in the long run, as we have thus far witnessed, any plan that does not engage the community is bound to fail.  As Michael Sandel, a political thinker who teaches government here, contends, good government requires what he calls \"successful republican (small r, to be sure!)  soulcraft\" and involves a gentler kind of tutelage.  For example, the political economy of citizenship that informed 19th-century American life sought to cultivate not only commonality but also the independence and judgement to deliberate well about the common good.  It worked not by coercion or deprivation as most of the present politicians advocate but by a complex mix of persuasion and habituation, what Alexis de Tocqueville, the French observer called \"the slow and quiet action of society upon itself.\"</span></p> <p><span>We will be doing ourselves a great disservice if we choose our president simply based on what he preaches according to where he is standing and in relation to the timing of the election.  When Bob Dole defends the tobacco industry while in tobacco country, but plays a different tune when addressing the rest of the country, the voters must take note of the disparity.  When President Clinton makes campaign promises and compassionately talks about issues without making actual substantial efforts to adopt and implement his promises, we must take notice and call his bluff.  If we entrust the executive branch to an individual simply because he belongs to our party and because we feel that he will be our friend, who knows how best to run the country, then, in these momentous times, I shall pray the old Spanish proverb, \"God save me from my friends, and I'll take care of my enemies.\"</span></p> <p><span><i>Ben Tahriri is in his second year as a Ph.D. candidate in government in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences</i>.</span></p>"}

{"title": "The Politics of Silence | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>W</b>hat I'm about to reveal may shock you:  I favor prayer in schools.  And not just private and parochial schools, either; I'm referring to public schools from coast to coast.  And yet, I firmly believe that the First Amendment's guarantee of separation of church and state must be maintained at all costs.  Although the presence of \"In G-d we trust\" on American currency does not offend my personal religious sensibilities, I would understand completely if it were removed for the sake of Constitutional principles.  Nor would I mind if \"under G-d\" were eliminated from the Pledge of Allegiance.  How can such bleeding heart liberalism be reconciled with saying the Lord's prayer every day in homerooms across America?</span></p> <p><span>Each day, right after the Pledge of Allegiance is mindlessly recited, schoolchildren, teachers and administrators should observe a mandatory minute of pure, unadulterated silence.  After the 60th second had passed, students and educators would be free to move along with the rest of the school day.</span></p> <p><span>The benefits of such a period of silence are many.  The minute would allow students with strong religious convictions a time to pray silently and secretly.  Atheists and non-religious types could use the time to think about the day's events.  Believers in new-age philosophies could meditate, provided they do so silently.  More pensive types might reflect on the nature of human existence and other great philosophical questions.  On Fridays, social expectations for the weekend will most dominate mental discourse.</span></p> <p><span><b>O</b>n another level, a moment of silence is healthy for a society in which noise and near chaos are the status quo.  Consider how few truly quiet times there are in an average day.  We use noise to wake us in the morning, and it seems to follow us until sweet slumber shields us from the sounds of the outside world.  Shutting up for a minute or two would be an auditory oasis:  a treat for the mind, body and soul alike.  Imagine how much more pleasant it would be if we could drive the Mass.  Pike in total silence.  Stopping for self-reflection or prayer provides a pause to consider the humanity that is so often stripped from us by all-nighters, 80-hour work weeks, timecards and exams after winter break.  Even what little time off we get is generally used for frantically trying to catch up on our \"real\" lives.  Indeed, the time has come for a mandatory minute of silence after the Pledge of Allegiance.  In fact, perhaps it can be instituted instead of the pledge, which is rarely performed respectfully anyway.  Die-hard patriots could use their minute to silently salute the flag.</span></p> <p><span>At the lowest level, enforcing a moment of silence is good for discipline.  Children should be taught how to close their mouths or stay in one place when told to do so.  But such a disciplinary tool only works if it is taken seriously and unequivocally executed universally:  complete silence, for a complete minute.  Students would not even be allowed to clean their guns or sharpen their knives until 60 seconds have elapsed.  At that point, usual classes and schoolyard violence would be allowed to resume.</span></p> <p><span><b>S</b>o yes, I am in favor of prayer in schools.  That doesn't make me a defender of embryos, destroyer of welfare or a bloodthirsty advocate of lethal injection or worse.  And Bob Dole shouldn't expect me to stuff envelopes for him in the coming months.</span></p> <p><span>Such a program will probably never be implemented.  And maybe that's not such a bad thing.  One could successfully argue that once a mandatory moment of quiet has been approved, it will be considerably easier for the religious right and their political sympathizers to obtain their aim of compulsory Christian liturgy.  Politicians can ruin anything, even something as simple as 60 seconds of silence.</span></p>"}

Buchanan, by comparison, had but 86 delegates.</span></p> <p><span>Buchanan's best hope to slow Dole was in Michigan, the only one of the four states that allocated its delegates in direct proportion to the results rather than on a winner-take-all basis.</span></p> <p><span>These industrial battlegrounds are likely to be pivotal come November.  Yesterday's results showed Dole getting 67 percent in Ohio, to 17 percent for Buchanan.  Illinois was 61 percent for Dole and 24 percent for Buchanan.

The Senate majority leader said the Republican Congress had tried to deliver on each of those fronts and \"he's vetoed it.\"</span></p> <p><span>Dole had every reason to be in good spirits.  Just a month ago, he lost New Hampshire to conservative columnist Patrick S. Buchanan and went on to lose three of the first five primaries.

So, the following is an attempt to sort out the favorites and sum up what could help and what could hurt in the race for the Oscars.</span></p> <p><span><b>Best Picture</b></span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>his category reflects the prevailing opinion that 1995 was a year of mediocre movies--despite 153 releases in wide distribution.  Aside from \"Sense and Sensibility,\" all of the nominees were released early in 1995.  This is extremely unusual, for serious Oscar contenders are typically released closer to the time of voting.  With no clear front-runner this year, the campaigns--such as ads in trade papers like Variety--can make a difference.</span></p> <p><span>\"Apollo 13\" is the only true big-budget Hollywood film on the list; \"Braveheart\" might count, as well, but it was filmed in England and Scotland.  \"Apollo 13\" could also ride on the wave of Tom Hanks' popularity--though Hanks, who won the Best Actor Oscar the last two years, was not nominated this year.  The film's director, Ron Howard, was not nominated either.  The only films that have won without their directors having been nominated are \"Driving Miss Daisy\" (1989) and \"Grand Hotel\" (1931-32).</span></p> <p><span>Despite the overwhelming critical acclaim that \"Babe\" has received, the film probably would not have been nominated in a year with more choices.  Remember, more animal actors means less work for human ones.  But this is a weak category and \"Babe,\" the surprise hit of the year, might just carry away the top prize.  \"Braveheart\" leads the pack with ten nominations, but don't expect a sweep comparable to that of \"Schindler's List\" or \"Gump.\"  \"Brave-heart\" may be deemed too gory--lots of big, violent battles--by many of the Academy members.  But Mel Gibson will probably win Best Director.</span></p> <p><span>Next is \"The Postman (Il Postino)\"--wait, you say, shouldn't that be in the foreign film category?  However, \"The Postman\" was not entered into consideration for best foreign film.  (There are conflicting reports as to the reasons behind this:  some say that Italy was annoyed that a Briton--Michael Radford--was directing an Italian film.  It has been said that since \"The Postman\" opened in Italy in 1994 it could not be nominated for Best Foreign Film of 1995; however, it opened in the U.S. in 1995 and thus could be nominated for best picture.)  Many feel that \"The Postman\" nominations were achieved by the massive advertising campaign launched by Miramax, the film's American distributor.  Nonetheless, when it comes to winning the actual award, \"The Postman\" will be hurt by its subtitles--no foreign film has ever won Best Picture.</span></p> <p><span>Nominee number five is \"Sense and Sensibility\"--like \"Apollo 13,\" its director (Ang Lee) did not receive a nomination.  But \"Sense\" won the Golden Globe award for best dramatic picture, and in the past 16 years, the Globes have accurately predicted 12 best picture winners, 12 best actors, and 14 best female actors.  But the Golden Globes also splits its awards into two categories, Drama and Comedy/Musical--this year, the latter award went to \"Babe.\"  Still, the odds are good for \"Sense and Sensibility.\"  It's not the clear favorite, but it probably has the edge.</span></p> <p><span>My choice wasn't nominated.  \"Leaving Las Vegas\" got shafted.  Director, actor, female actor, and screenplay all received nominations--so how could it not be nominated for best film?  Of the five nominated films, \"Sense and Sensibility\" is my personal favorite.  \"Apollo 13,\" aside from a few genuinely thrilling moments, was one of the most boring movies I've ever seen.  The movie did not get off the ground until the astronauts did.  To quote film critic David Denby, it's the Bob Dole of films.  As for the rest:  \"Babe\" stars animals and animatronics; who wants to see \"Braveheart\"?--not me; \"The Postman\" was sweet, but it has only received this much attention because its star died.</span></p> <p><span><b>Best Actor</b></span></p> <p><span><b>I</b> guess eponymous characters spell success--four out of five of the best actor nominees play characters referred to in their film's title (Sean Penn is the \"Dead Man Walking\").  That may get you the nomination but not the award.  The favorite in this race is Nicolas Cage for his role in \"Leaving Las Vegas.\"  And he would be my choice as well.  Richard Dreyfuss?  Big deal, so he ages 30 years in two hours in \"Mr. Holland's Opus.\"  Anthony Hopkins?  Good, but not good enough; and he just won not long ago for \"Silence of the Lambs.\"  Massimo Troisi?  He was good but a little annoying, and everyone knows that he was nominated solely because he died the day after filming for \"The Postman\" concluded.  The last time an actor received a posthumous nomination was when Peter Finch won for \"Network\" in 1976.  Sean Penn received excellent reviews, but if the Academy votes for a depressing role, it will be Cage.</span></p> <p><span>Two big names were not included in the list of nominations:  Tom Hanks and John Travolta.  Early on, many people seemed to be expecting a repeat of the \"Forrest Gump\" - \"Pulp Fiction\" race of last year.  But, I have to say, I'm happy that neither one was nominated.  Hanks gave a stolid performance, unexciting and annoyingly self-righteous, as usual.  Travolta was amusing in \"Get Shorty\" but his role gave him nothing to do; he was much better in \"Pulp Fiction.\"  An actor, however, who really should have been nominated is Jonathan Pryce, for his stellar performance as the eccentric Lytton Strachey in \"Carrington.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>Best Female Actor</b></span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>n recent years, Hollywood has had difficulty finding five best-film nominees and five best-female actor nominees.  While the former category is still weak, this year there were more than enough candidates for best female actor.  Some female studio executives regard this increase in good women's roles as a mere fluke and not the sign of a shift in Hollywood.  Others cite the increase in women directors, producers and executives, as well as the influence of stars like Emma Thompson and Nicole Kidman, who were pivotal in creating \"Sense and Sensibility\" and \"To Die For.\"  Note, however, that three of this year's nominated female actors--Elisabeth Shue and Sharon Stone for Best Actress, Mira Sorvino '90 for Best Supporting Actress--play prostitutes.  Oscars have often gone to female actor in prostitute roles, including Jane Fonda, Susan Hayward and Elizabeth Taylor.  Playing a prostitute in \"Pretty Woman\" turned Julia Roberts into a star.  It seems that women's roles tend to fall into one of two categories:  the wholesome girlfriend or the \"woman of loose morals,\" the saint or the slut.</span></p> <p><span>This year there were so many Best Actress contenders that some of them had to be left out.  Omitted from the list of nominees were Nicole Kidman, for her role as an overly ambitious newscaster in the black comedy \"To Die For\" and Jennier Jason Leigh, for her portrayal of a drug-addicted would-be rock star in \"Georgia.\"  Also missing is Vanessa Redgrave, who received a Golden Globe nomination for her performance in \"A Month by the Lake.\" She was not expected to be an Oscar nominee, but I, for one, am of the opinion that every time Vanessa Redgrave appears in a film, she should be nominated.</span></p> <p><span>Who's going to win?  This is perhaps the most competitive race.  Thompson won three years ago for \"Howards End,\" and we've seen her do this kind of role before.  But look for her in the adapted screeplay category--it is the one sure thing this year that Emma Thompson will win for her \"Sense and Sensibility\" screenplay.  Some critics complained that Thompson's script was too streamlined, jettisoning too much of the book and updating parts, but she has primarily won kudos for turning Jane Austen into today's hottest writer.</span></p> <p><span>This is Streep's tenth Oscar nomination--an accomplishment matched by only two other female actors, Bette Davis and Katharine Hepburn.  But her chances of winning are hurt by the fact that she was won twice before--these days, it seems that Streep is always nominated but never expected to win.</span></p> <p><span>Elisabeth Shue received critical acclaim as the hooker with a heart of gold in \"Leaving Las Vegas.\"  She was named Best Actress by the National Society of Film Critics and the Los Angeles Film Critics.  But she will not win the Oscar.  Sharon Stone received terrific reviews for her performance in \"Casino,\" showing that she can now be taken seriously as an female actor.  Remember, lots of media exposure can help in the awards race, so Stone's March \"Vanity Fair\" cover article could give her a push.  Stone has also been described, as a tireless campaigner.  Plus, she won the Golden Globe for best female actor--the Golden Globes used to be considered laughable, but they have slowly gained respect because they often predict the Oscar winners.  Since 1989, the Golden Globes have been 75 percent correct in predicting the Oscars in the four acting categories.</span></p> <p><span>Then there is Susan Sarandon.  This is her fourth nomination in years.  \"Dead Man Walking\" was really more Sean Penn's picture, but if she wins, the award will be in recognition of her earlier work as much as for this role.  There is a definite feeling that Sarandon truly deserves an Oscar, and so she could definitely win it this year.  Plus, she was the Hasty Pudding Theatricals Woman of the Year!</span></p> <p><span>Supporting Female Actor</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>hy was Kathleen Quinlan nominated for \"Apollo 13\"?  This is the kind of \"waiting wife\" role that Hollywood female actor are too often forced to play.  In a year with great female roles, Quinlan need not have been nominated for this nothing part.  And why Mare Winning-ham for \"Georgia\"?  Jennifer Jason Leigh is the female actor in \"Georgia\" that everyone was talking about.</span></p> <p><span>The race is between two contenders, Mira Sorvino and Joan Allen.  Each claims her share of devotees, but this is the category where newcomers often seem to be rewarded--Marisa Tomei and Anna Paquin, for example.  Last year, Dianne Wiest won for her supporting role in another Woody Allen film.  I would be happy if either one took home the Oscar, but Sorvino, a Harvard grad, is the sentimental favorite.</span></p> <p><span><b>Supporting Actor</b></span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>nd the winner is...not James Cromwell, who was one of the few people in \"Babe\" (unless there's a surprise \"Babe\" sweep), not Tim Roth (I didn't see \"Rob Roy,\" did you?), perhaps Brad Pitt--he left his pretty boy roles behind, donned brown contact lenses to cover up those baby blues and played a crazy animal rights activist in \"12 Monkeys.\"  Hollywood likes to reward people who break from typecasting, but remember when Winona Ryder was supposed to win Best Supporting Actress for \"The Age of Innocence?\"  (She won the Golden Globe, but Anna Paquin won the Oscar.)</span></p> <p><span>Why is everyone mentioning Ed Harris?  Sure, he was fine as ground control in \"Apollo 13,\" but he did not really do anything (I liked Gary Sinise more).  Suddenly, however, he is discussed as a possible favorite for the Oscar.  But the best bet is Kevin Spacey in the ultra-hip, ultra-gimmicky \"The Usual Suspects.\"  The New York Film Critics Circle named him best supporting actor for his body of work this year, which also included \"Swimming with Sharks,\" \"Seven,\" and \"Out-break.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>ell, there you have it.  Stay tuned next Monday to see who wins.  But remember, this year, anything goes.  As Miramax head Harvey Weinstein said, \"We're going to put the bookmakers out of business this year.\"  So, dear reader, you ask, what did Yours Truly put down on her Harvard Dining Services Oscar ballot?  Two words:  multiple ballots.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Volunteering Beats Voting | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>H</b>elplessness.  That's what I felt when Massachussetts Governor Bill Weld gerrymandered my hometown--Northampton--out of the 1st congressional district for the sole purpose of trying to get a Republican into Massachusetts' delegation.  The summer after 10th grade, I had spent a month volunteering for the campaign of my congressman, John Olver, a retired UMass chemistry professor.  I had attended his frenetic victory party, filled with hope for this system I had--or so I thought--learned to work within.  Liberalism had its moment in the sun and I felt a part of it all.</span></p> <p><span>Then, all of a sudden, my representative in Washington was whisked away from me, and slick-haired Richie Neal--a Democrat, yes, but no Olver--was now my representative.  In spite of the hopeful fact that a new party was also on the brink of winning the presidency for the first time since I was almost too small to remember, Weld's move shook me.  It was that easy for the governor to render months, even years, of grassroots organizing in Northampton--Olver's stronghold and home base--completely useless at the following election.  While Weld's move didn't ultimately work (John Olver is currently US Representative in the 2nd congressional district), my faith in politics was damaged forever.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>hat helpless feeling has come back with a strange familiarity as I've watched Bob Dole tear through the Republican primaries.  Dole, as I recall, was the guy to the right of Bush, the conservative we Democrats feared even more than Reagan's heir-apparent in '88.  Dole might well be elected president, and there's not exactly anything I can personally do to combat that fact.</span></p> <p><span>There's no doubt that we should all vote, of course.  It's not such a big burden for energetic college students to fill out an absentee ballot or trudge over to the polls.  But voting alone, particularly if it's for a losing cause, does not--for me at least--appease that feeling of hopelessness, of standing idly by and watching America go down the tubes.  So what can we do during those 1,455 or so days when we're not voting?  Work on a political campaign?  Perhaps.  But I think there are plenty of more direct ways of helping in the meantime, in that forgotten span of time between one set of PAC-and corporation-backed campaigns and ghost-written speeches and the next.</span></p> <p><span>The other method involves actively becoming a part of the structure which the government refuses to implement.  Plenty of people seem to care about certain policies more than enough to complain about who is in office on the basis of those policies.  But relatively few complainers move much toward becoming human replacements for the dollars which a new budget has snatched--or will snatch--away from public programs and support structures.  In my view, there are two kinds of political disillusionment--disillusionment accompanied by helplessness, which I came to know all too well and disillusionment accompanied by corrective action, even if only on a small scale, which I am glad to have been able to come to know better.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>he wonderful thing about volunteer programs is that they offer anyone a chance to effect the same kind of change which might lead to convoluted political battles on a larger scale, while staying safely committed to nonpartisan common goals like providing adults with the skills they need to find employment themselves.  Members of both political parties volunteer for PEN, Partners for Empowering Neighborhoods, a student group at Harvard devoted to adult education, empowering its adult students, many of whom are supporting families, with literacy and job skills.  PEN is one of many volunteer organizations that benefit from some government funding.  This year, for example, the HOPE 6 fund, an initiative devoted to taking on certain selected inner-city communities and pumping resources into them, is in part responsible for the success of our program at Mission Hill.  But HOPE 6 is only money.  Adult education classes are taught by people.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b> vote is impersonal, any way you construe it.  Its value should not be discounted, but the mob mentality is partly right in that a vote won't do much by itself.  The mistake we must avoid is allowing helplessness to spawn from that trivial fact.  A vote sits only on the fringe of your rights and privileges as an American.  You have the right to vote, but you also have the right to volunteer and accomplish much more than your vote possibly could.  A Republican administration might well eliminate HOPE 6.  Will that negate the will of the hundreds of caring Boston and Cambridge residents (and, yes, lowly Harvard students) who take it upon themselves to help Mission Hill thrive as a community and to help its residents break out of the cycle of poverty and unemployment?</span></p> <p><span>If HOPE 6 is scrapped--be it by Republicans or Democrats--we, as Americans, are fully capable of replacing every penny eliminated by Washington with a dollar of manpower through personal action in inner-city neighborhoods, through volunteer education and empowerment.  You may stand on either side of the political spectrum.  But regardless, your right--and privilege--to do your part to make America the kind of place you'd like it to be is not cut off with the funding.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>t is not your obligation to back your vote with action, or to combat a political loss with a personal commitment to the people you thought your vote would help.  But as much as you may whine about who's in office (and by all means you should whine if you feel that way), single mothers and immigrant families at Boston housing projects won't hear your--or my--complaints about gerrymandering or slick hair.  They will hear us better, I think, if we--while learning ourselves from their own unique perspectives--offer to share our knowledge of the English language, or resume-writing, or basic computer skills, with them.</span></p> <p><span><i>Robin Goldstein is the Administrative Director of Partners for Empowering Neighborhoods.</i></span></p>"}

Lewis '68 has vetoed a recent Undergraduate Council resolution to ban the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) from holding its commissioning ceremonies in Harvard Yard.</span></p> <p><span>The resolution requests that Lewis oppose a compromise which terminated the University's financial support of the ROTC program but continues to permit the commissioning ceremony to be held in the Yard.</span></p> <p><span>\"This bill...is basically a request that I oppose the compromise announced by then-Acting-President Carnesale at the February 14, 1995 meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences,\" Lewis wrote in a letter Wednesday to council President Robert M.

Experience:</b>  Four semesters, three as an executive</span></p> <p><span><b>Key Positions:</b>  Safety; Curricular issues; Advising reform</span></p> <p><span>If one were to draw analogies between the races for president of the Undergraduate Council and president of the United States, Robert M. Hyman '98-'97 would probably correspond to President Clinton.</span></p> <p><span>Like Clinton, Hyman is gunning for another term as president.  Like Clinton, Hyman is regarded as an energetic leader who is popular among liberal, progressive observers.  And Hyman's campaign signs with running mate Lamelle D. Rawlins '99 bear more than a passing resemblance to those of Clinton-Gore '92.</span></p> <p><span>But some observers have said that Hyman also carries at least one of Clinton's weaknessesl:  like Clinton, Hyman has been attacked as a \"consummate politician\" who caters unfairly to those who will support him most.</span></p> <p><span>In addition, Hyman has been criticized for failing to deal well with the council's divisiveness.  Indeed, Hyman has shouldered part of the blame for the unusually high number of council resignations this year.</span></p> <p><span>Hyman is running on a campaign of \"A Student's Bill of Rights,\" a platform emphasizing safety, gender concerns, privacy issues and curriculum and advising reform, among others.</span></p> <p><span>Hyman is also running on his record.  Under his guidance, last fall's council passed more resolutions than any session in recent memory.</span></p> <p><span>The council implemented popular elections, helped pressure the administration to return Coca-Cola to campus, sponsored the Rape Aggression Defense program and the Harvard Alliance for Safety Training and Education, and set up a phone bank to allow students to call their representatives in Washington about financial aid.</span></p> <p><span>\"Clearly when people are talking about the strides the council has made, that's an indicator of change.  We've simply broken the mold,\" Hyman says.</span></p> <p><span>He also presents himself and Rawlins as executives who have made a break from the council's old system.</span></p> <p><span>\"There's a type of experience like the old U.C. but I don't think that applies,\" he says.  \"Lamelle and I stand before the students as leaders of a genuine return to student concern.  In that sense, we have experience as changers.\"</span></p> <p><span>Hyman managed to avoid major scandals during his more than six months as president.  But many members have attacked the current council as being overly divisive.</span></p> <p><span>Hyman says he believes that factionalism within the council this year is not a major problem.</span></p> <p><span>\"The idea of putting students first is not incompatible with progressive issues.  That's a false dichotomy.\"</span></p> <p><span>Other members of the council say Hyman has a definite bias, to the detriment of campus life issues.</span></p> <p><span>\"He is a consummate politician,\" said council member Wesley B. Gilchrist '98, who ran for president unsuccessfully against Hyman in February.  \"He knows who is most vocal, whose favor he needs.</span></p> <p><span>Hyman denies the allegations, and says his record of reform is the final say on his campaign.</span></p> <p><span><b>Edward B. Smith III '97</b></span></p> <p><span><b>Previous U.C. Experience:</b>  Four semesters, two as an executive</span></p> <p><span><b>Key Positions:</b>  Increased efficiency in approving legislation; \"Common sense\" view of social events</span></p> <p><span>Edward B. Smith III '97 wants to bring the business experience he has gained as the council's treasurer to increasing its efficiency in approving effective legislation.</span></p> <p><span>He criticizes the dearth of fully-developed proposals brought before the council.</span></p> <p><span>He points to the failure of the council's resolution on the ROTC commissioning ceremony as an example of ill-informed legislation.  He says no one who was knowledgeable about the history of the administration's previous position on the ceremony was consulted on the proposal.</span></p> <p><span>The council should also take \"a common sense\" view of social events, according to Smith.</span></p> <p><span>\"The U.C. [has a] propensity to lose large amounts of money on unnecessarily elaborate events,\" says Smith.</span></p> <p><span>He proposed the council should buy blocks of tickets to off-campus concerts and run shuttle buses to them, instead of directly sponsoring large concerts on campus.</span></p> <p><span>He also has a lot of experience in managing and reforming the finances of the council, Smith said.</span></p> <p><span>\"There is a reputation for trust that I have developed in my efforts to reorganize the council's finances as treasurer.  I completely rewrote the rules to prevent embezzlement and other funny money that have regrettably plagued other campus organizations,\" Smith says.</span></p> <p><span>Smith wants to make the council \"a campus-wide clearinghouse for information,\" Smith said.</span></p> <p><span>Smith said he would like to see the council put together publications that would simplify guidelines for students, such as a pamphlet on what to do if you've been exposed to AIDS.</span></p> <p><span>Additionally, Smith alleges the Nelson-Grimmelmann Act, under which Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis '68 may approve certain council legislation, strips the council of any power it might have, according to Smith.</span></p> <p><span>The act must be appealed needs to be repealed, he says.</span></p> <p><span>\"The ball is in our court,\" said Smith.  \"And lately, the U.C. has not been playing its best game.  I want things to change.\"</span></p> <p><span>On a lighter note, Smith says, \"The president of the U.C. has to be someone you trust to represent you, but also someone you'd be psyched to hang out with on a Saturday night.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>Michael R. Petitpas '95-'97</b></span></p> <p><span><b>Previous U.C. Experience:</b>  None</span></p> <p><span><b>Key Positions:</b>  Using age and maturity to get things done</span></p> <p><span>In 1994, David L. Hanselman '94-'95 ran for council president with the odds stacked against him:  he'd been away from campus for a year, his classmates had graduated and his contacts were few.</span></p> <p><span>But Hanselman capitalized on his status as an outsider with maturity.  And he won.</span></p> <p><span>Michael R. Petitpas '95-'97 of Pforzheimer House is trying to follow in Hanselman's footsteps.</span></p> <p><span>Petitpas doesn't offer much in the way of fresh ideas--he promises to tackle old favorites like Core reform, ethnic studies and housing.</span></p> <p><span>Instead, like Hanselman, he's banking primarily on his age and maturity.</span></p> <p><span>\"It's time for me to give back to the college,\" Petitpas said.  \"What I hope to offer most is leadership.  The council needs an outside perspective.\"</span></p> <p><span>Unlike Hanselman, however, Petitpas has no council experience.  When asked about this potential drawback, Petitpas turns once again to his age and life experience.</span></p> <p><span>\"I've been at Harvard longer than any of the other candidates,\" Petitpas says.  \"Though I haven't served on the U.C., I've been general manager of WHRB so I have experience running a large student organization.\"</span></p> <p><span>Petitpas hopes this experience will allow him to tap a resource of student ideas and discussions both within and outside of the council.</span></p> <p><span><b>Jason D. Hill '97</b></span></p> <p><span><b>Previous U.C. Experience:</b>  None</span></p> <p><span><b>Key Positions:</b>  Dissolving the council</span></p> <p><span>Had enough of the Undergraduate Council?  So has Jason D. Hill '97 of Quincy House.</span></p> <p><span>While many presidential candidates have grand visions for molding the Undergraduate Council into a campus force that will bring the administration to its knees, throw wildly successful concerts and distribute thousands of dollars to needy student groups, Hill has a much more nihilist vision.</span></p> <p><span>If elected, he plans to dissolve the council.</span></p> <p><span>\"I believe that only by drastic change will we be able to have a student government that will effectively represent the student population,\" Hill says.</span></p> <p><span>Hill is still formulating his own model for student government.  But he does have a few ideas:  shorter meetings and a focus on issues involving day-to-day student life.</span></p> <p><span>As an example, Hill cites the recent council debate on Coke and Pepsi.</span></p> <p><span>\"Kids should be drinking milk anyway,\" he says.</span></p> <p><span>Hill also hopes to involve the whole student body in his efforts to remove and replace the council.</span></p> <p><span>\"Before it was actually dismantled, I'd institute a process by which students could have a say in restructuring their government,\" Hill says.</span></p> <p><span>\"I might not know what's best for Harvard but we do need change,\" he adds.</span></p> <p><span>Hill hopes that the administration will help in the reorganizational process, but he further asserts that the council's successor should be essentially student-run.</span></p> <p><span>\"I definitely believe that the administration should have some say in how we reorganize our government,\" Hill says.  \"But once it is established, it should be essentially student-run and not just a playground for gov jocks.\"</span></p> <p><span>Hill's zeal to dissolve the council may seem surprising, considering he's never served on the body and says he hasn't attended a meeting in years.</span></p> <p><span>But he says he keeps himself up-to-date on council activity by reading the published minutes.</span></p> <p><span>And he further says that his apparent inexperience will actually be quite beneficial to the student body.</span></p> <p><span>\"I would say that the type of campaign I'm running doesn't necessarily require experience,\" Hill says.  \"I'm running under the idea of restructuring the student government.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>Benjamin R.

Kaplan '99-'98 of Holworthy Hall wants a different method to the council's madness.</span></p> <p><span>Calling his candidacy an \"analyst's perspective\" of the council, Kaplan, who is not currently on the council, is moving to enact a series of internal procedural reforms.</span></p> <p><span>\"I took on the role of an analyst and spent the year analyzing the U.C.,\" says Kaplan, who is a Crimson editor.  \"The ideas I have, which are completely different, are the result of having studied the council for a year.\"</span></p> <p><span>Kaplan's platform consists of three distinguishing planks.</span></p> <p><span>First, he hopes to create an Inter-Club Congress to facilitate an exchange of ideas and a sense of community within the College.</span></p> <p><span>Second, Kaplan would mandate that all council representatives periodically e-mail a certain designated group of students about council activity.</span></p> <p><span>\"They would be able to tell their group of students what's been going on and could ask them for their comments and concerns,\" Kaplan said.</span></p> <p><span>Third, he hopes the council will analyze more issues from a cost-benefit perspective.</span></p> <p><span>For example, he says that the council should have done some more homework in preparing a recent bill calling for extended hours in the Tex-Mex restaurant in Loker Commons.</span></p> <p><span>\"The council has been devaluing their own currency by making demands and decrees on different issues,\" Kaplan says.  \"They don't have the research to be more persuasive.\"</span></p> <p><span>Kaplan is also relying on what he says is a unique position:  being an outsider who knows the process well.</span></p> <p><span>Kaplan has never attended a council meeting.  But he says his experience as a Crimson central administration reporter has helped prepare him to be council president.</span></p> <p><span>\"I've really used The Crimson as my window into what the council's doing,\" Kaplan says.  \"Because I covered the central administration, I've had more contact with deans and administrators than almost all of the current council representatives.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>How They Voted</b></span></p> <p><span>On certain bills, the U.C. records how each of its members votes.

{"title": "PARTISAN STRIFE | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>For the Harvard College Democrats (HCD), last winter's trips to New Hampshire to campaign for President Clinton were a dream come true.</span></p> <p><span>While they journeyed north to the Granite State as a solidified group, the HCD witnessed their arch-rivals, the campus Republicans, take to the stump as two separate organizations embittered by months of infighting.</span></p> <p><span>The fact that the Harvard Republican Club (HRC) and Harvard-Radcliffee Republican Alliance (HRRA) did not unite during the primary season is just one symbol of the rift created last year when the Harvard-Radcliffee Republican Club split into the HRC and HRRA.</span></p> <p><span>And as a result of this rift, many are beginning to question the impact and strength of Republicanism at and strength of Republicanism at Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>\"It makes a laughing stock out of Republicans on campus to have all this infighting,\" says Charles A. Truesdell III '99, first-year member-at-large of the HRC.</span></p> <p><span><b>A Tumultuous Election</b></span></p> <p><span>The seeds of the split among campus Republicans began in the fall of 1994, when many say the Harvard-Radcliffe Republican Club began to become significantly more conservative.</span></p> <p><span>At that time, the club voted to drop the word Radcliffe from its name, a measure that some former club members contend led female members of the club to feel that they did not stand on equal ground with the male members of the organization.</span></p> <p><span>\"In general, a lot of the female members that were with the HRC that are now with the HRRA felt uncomfortable because of the sexist atmosphere,\" says Scott L.  Tribble '98, vice president of the HRRA.</span></p> <p><span>Tribble attributes the uncomfortable atmosphere in part to the fact that many writers who expressed racist and sexist sentiments in Peninsula, a conservative campus publication, also belonged to the club.</span></p> <p><span>\"A lot of sentiments in Peninsula were very racist and sexist,\" Tribble says.  \"And a lot of that was expressed in the attitudes and policies of the HRC.\"</span></p> <p><span>The final straw that led to the breakup of the HRC occurred as a result of the HRC executive board elections held in February 1995.</span></p> <p><span>Members of the HRRA allege that members who did not pay club dues voted in the election and that these non-paying voters tipped the results to the club's more conservative faction.</span></p> <p><span>\"Our original intention was not to found another club, but it soon became apparent that we could not compete with their underhanded election methods,\" Amanda P.  Williams '96, HRRA's first president, told The Crimson last year.</span></p> <p><span>But James M.  Dickerson '98, the victor of that fateful election and the HRC's current president, tells a story that starkly contrasts with the HRRA's accusations of election tampering and bigotry.</span></p> <p><span>He contends that the denunciations leveled against the HRC by the HRRA stem from the HRRA's incorrect belief that the HRC and Peninsula at the time were interchangeable organizations rather than two separate clubs.</span></p> <p><span>Instead, Dickerson turns the tables, blasting the HRRA and its current president, William D.  Zerhouni '98, and claims that the new Republican club was formed as a result of personal differences rather than ideological ones.</span></p> <p><span>\"Those were ridiculous accusations used to undermine the club; they were totally unfounded,\" Dickerson says.  \"People might think that Zerhouni's a sexist, but that's no reason for a group to leave an entire organization.\"</span></p> <p><span>But other HRC members offer more shocking explanations for why the break occurred.</span></p> <p><span>\"I don't think [HRRA members] had noble intentions,\" says Brian E. Malone '96, a member and former vice president of the HRC.  \"I think they were upset that they lost the HRC elections and they needed something to put on their resumes.\"</span></p> <p><span>Malone says it is extremely suspicious that the HRRA put approximately half of its 20 members on the executive board when the organization was started.</span></p> <p><span><b>Two Outlooks</b></span></p> <p><span>Although there is some doubt as to whether ideological differences led to the HRRA's formation, the two clubs have staked out rather different philosophical positions on numerous issues.</span></p> <p><span>In its short existence, the HRRA has prided itself on creating a more inclusive club that projects a positive outlook for Republicans.</span></p> <p><span>In addition, club members have not hesitated to boast that the Alliance's membership exceeds that of the HRC.</span></p> <p><span>\"We formed the [HRRA] to show that Republicans are tolerant, that Republicans are inclusive, that Republicans have a positive agenda and that Republicans are optimistic about this country,\" says Zerhouni.</span></p> <p><span>This year, the stances the two clubs have taken on a number of issues illustrate their differences.</span></p> <p><span>The HRC and HRRA backed different sides in the clash between members of Philip Brooks House Association (BA) and the Harvard administration, which led BA to push for increased autonomy from the University.</span></p> <p><span>While the HRRA supported PBHA's move toward autonomy, the HRC found fault with PBHA's position.</span></p> <p><span>The HRC declared that the opposition of the PBHA toward Assistant Dean of the College for Public Service Judith H. Kidd, the new director of PBH, was unjustified and that PBHA's separation from Harvard \"was not in the best interest of the donors.\"</span></p> <p><span>An even greater ideological rift between the two Republican groups appeared over the winter as the race for the Republican presidential nominee heated up.</span></p> <p><span>HRC is committed to following the national party's platform, which means that club members would therefore support any Republican who emerged as the victor of the nationwide primaries.</span></p> <p><span>Members of HRRA say they would not necessarily endorse the party's nominee, citing candidates such as political commentator Patrick J. Buchanan as possibly too \"extreme.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"I think Pat Buchanan threatens to lead the Republican party in the entirely wrong direction,\" Zerhouni says.  \"His message of division, hatred and pessimism has no place in respectable politics.\"</span></p> <p><span>Despite the fact that the two groups travelled separately to New Hampshire, Zerhouni concedes the groups may eventually unite temporarily to support Sen. Robert J. Dole (R-Kan.).</span></p> <p><span><b>Scathing Accusations</b></span></p> <p><span>In addition to open disagreement with each other over political stances, the two groups have also traded barbs over more mundane items.</span></p> <p><span>Just as the HRRA attacked the 1995 HRC elections, HRC members questioned the way in which this year's HRRA elections were conducted.</span></p> <p><span>In a series of e-mail messages, the HRC alleged that \"serious procedural errors\" marred the election.</span></p> <p><span>\"Mr. Zerhouni has begun a campaign of exclusion against members of the HRRA who disagree with him on issues of management,\" one message stated.</span></p> <p><span>At the time, Zerhouni discounted the e-mail message and concluded it was the only way the HRC could hope to save its declining membership.</span></p> <p><span>The two organizations can not even agree on how many members they have.</span></p> <p><span>The HRRA currently claims to have approximately 40 paying members and 60 associate members, while the HRC says it has more than 60 dues-paying members.</span></p> <p><span>\"[The HRRA] can't even produce a membership list, so they haven't produced proof of their numbers,\" says Dickerson.</span></p> <p><span>HRRA says not only that the count for the club's membership is accurate but also that the numbers give an indication of its popularity on campus.</span></p> <p><span>\"Given the membership we have, there's a definite student body desire to have this organization,\" says Colin Kennedy '97, treasurer of the HRRA.</span></p> <p><span><b>No Dialogue</b></span></p> <p><span>As a result of these petty squabbles, the two groups have made little effort to communicate with each other.  Before any ephemeral cease fire can take place, both the HRRA and the HRC must first overcome this hurdle.</span></p> <p><span>Indeed, one of the contacts that was made between a HRC member and someone from the HRRA inevitably resulted in a scandal.</span></p> <p><span>Last month, Malone accused Truesdell, the first-year member-at-large in the HRC, of \"unethical dealings\" after an informal meeting had taken place between Truesdell and Zerhouni.</span></p> <p><span>Malone said that Truesdell and Zerhouni were surreptiously planning to form a single Republican club which would replace the current organizations.  Malone accused Truesdell of overstepping his duty as an HRC representative.</span></p> <p><span>At this point, Zerhouni stepped into the melee by writing a scathing letter to The Crimson regarding the controversy.</span></p> <p><span>In the letter, Zerhouni called Malone \"sneaky, underhanded and cowardly.\"</span></p> <p><span>One \"sneaky, underhanded and cowardly.\"</span></p> <p><span>Zerhouni also claimed that Truesdell's \"sexuality played no small part in Brian Malone's decision to attempt to expel him.\"</span></p> <p><span>Truesdell, who is openly bisexual, denies that his sexuality had anything to do with Malone's attempt to get him expelled or that his sexual preference has ever been an issue at the HRC.</span></p> <p><span>\"Zerhouni's just using this to further his own cause,\" says Truesdell.  \"If [HRC] is truly this bigoted organization, I'm sure I wouldn't be on the executive board.\"</span></p> <p><span>Truesdell has been cleared of all the charges brought against him by Malone.</span></p> <p><span>Nevertheless, this affair raises questions over whether steps will ever be taken to establish one Republican organization and whether two heads are really better than one.</span></p> <p><span>\"Members of the HRRA are always welcome to join the HRC,\" Malone says.  \"I hope there's never any sort of agreement where the HRC has to admit any wrongdoing.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>Disharmony</b></span></p> <p><span>Neither group has expressed any interest in compromising their positions to form one Republican organization.</span></p> <p><span>\"The existence of a second club gives an outlet for people who would otherwise feel alienated from the HRC,\" says Kennedy.</span></p> <p><span>One individual that has been smiling throughout the deluge of bad publicity facing the two clubs is Seth D. Hanlon '98, president of the HCD.</span></p> <p><span>\"I think all [HRC and HRRA] do is bicker,\" Hanlon says.  \"It helps us in the sense that it makes us look like adults.\"</span></p> <p><span>Members of the HRC agree that the infighting is detrimental to the Republican cause.</span></p> <p><span>\"I think Seth [Hanlon] is totally enjoying this,\" says Truesdell.</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps the split among Republicans at Harvard may symbolize the national Republican split between the far right and the conservative moderates.</span></p> <p><span>Just as Republican infighting shows no signs of easing at the national level, so too do the tensions between Harvard's two groups of Republicans show no sign of dissipating in the near future.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Pay Attention to Clinton's New Hampshire Victory | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>When I opened The Crimson upon returning from New Hampshire the morning after the Republican primary, I couldn't help but wonder what happened to nearly one-third of the voters.  I agree that the \"NH Voters Turn[ed] Out in Droves to Cast Ballots\" (Feb. 21, 1996), but contrary to Don Frary's prediction that \"the only ones who won't vote are the Democrats,\" the Democratic voters of New Hampshire turned out in great numbers to enthusiastically endorse President Clinton.  Receiving over 95 percent of the unofficial vote count, President Clinton topped the New Hampshire primary showings of all unopposed incumbent presidents by much more than anyone expected.  Even Ronald Reagan, who went on to win 49 states in the 1984 general election, received only 84 percent of the primary vote in New Hampshire.</span></p> <p><span>By receiving 20,000 more votes than any Republican candidate, President Clinton's primary victory demonstrated the solidarity and strength of the Democratic Party and the people's belief that we must come together to confront America's challenges.  Although Clinton faced no major opposition from within his own party, President Clinton and the Democrats did face an opponent in Tuesday's election, but we conquered it.  In a campaign speech last weekend, the president said, \"You say, you don't have an opponent, Mr. President.  Oh, yes, I do, and so do you.  Our opponent is cynicism.  It is negativism.  It is apathy.  It is division.  It is the short-term gain instead of the long-term interest of the country.  These are our opponents.  Remember, when we are united we never lose; when we're divided, we defeat ourselves.\"  On the day of the primary, the Democrats of New Hampshire and everyone involved with Clinton-Gore '96 helped Bill Clinton confront this opponent, and we triumphed.</span></p> <p><span>While the Republican candidates spent the last months fighting amongst one another--promoting cynicism, negativism, apathy and division--the Clinton-Gore campaign focused its eyes on bringing the country together to confront the challenges of tomorrow.  Organizing the largest field operation in the history of the New Hampshire primary, the Clinton-Gore campaign concentrated on grassroots instead of paid media, the positive instead of the negative and the challenges of tomorrow instead of the failures of yesterday.  On the cold weekends and late nights when the Republican headquarters were closed, the Democratic volunteers and staffers worked energetically to reach the people.</span></p> <p><span>Over the last month, members of the Harvard-Radcliffe College Democrats and hundreds of volunteers from colleges throughout the country converged upon New Hampshire to engage in a war against negativism, apathy and division.  We distributed literature in rain and snow, marched through the streets chanting \"Four More to Clinton-Gore\" in 10-degree weather, called all Democratic voters about five times on election day and attended President Clinton rallies, which were attended by more people than all Republican campaign events combined.  The other volunteers and I worked hard, but we didn't do it just for Bill Clinton.  We did it because we are sick of negativism and division; we did it because we believe in the future and have faith that, together, we can confront any challenge.  On Tuesday, the people of New Hampshire joined us in our work.  They enthusiastically voiced their belief that, together, we can make the future better than the past.</span></p> <p><span>At the Democratic victory party on Tuesday night, President Clinton told us in a telephone call, \"I'm more grateful tonight than I've ever been.  I'm more determined than I've ever been to keep this country on a positive course.\"  After the New Hampshire primary, I, too, am more grateful than I have ever been; I am grateful that President Clinton is committed to my generation's future, and I am grateful that the American people have the courage to say no to cynicism, negativism, division and apathy, and say yes to tomorrow. <i>--J.

Loss, Dole Sharpens Vision | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>BOSTON--What a difference two weeks can make.</span></p> <p><span>After the Feb. 20 New Hampshire primary, Sen. Robert J. Dole (R-Kan.) was upset by Patrick J. Buchanan and many observers felt his campaign was on the ropes.</span></p> <p><span>But following Dole's sweeping of all eight states in yesterday's Yankee Primary, supporters confidently proclaimed Dole as the candidate who would lead the Republicans to victory against President Clinton.</span></p> <p><span>Many feel Dole's defeats in both New Hampshire and Arizona were a wake-up call that helped revitalize his stagnant campaign.</span></p> <p><span>Although Dole entered the primary season as the clear frontrunner, Buchanan's victory sent a startling message to Dole that the GOP nomination was not in the bag.</span></p> <p><span>Greater organization and the enunciation of a clear vision were the key elements propelling Dole to victory yesterday.</span></p> <p><span>The endorsements of top-ranking Massachusetts Republican officials, including Governor William F. Weld '66, Lt. Gov. Paul Cellucci and State Treasurer Joseph D. Malone '78 helped rally the state's rank-and-file behind Dole.</span></p> <p><span>\"[The Massachusetts victory] shows the organizational prowess led by Treasurer Malone in conjunction with all the other elected officials, said Lou Markakis, state events coordinator for Dole.</span></p> <p><span>But organization alone could not have boosted Dole from his lackluster second-place finish in the Granite State to yesterday's impressive victories.</span></p> <p><span>Buchanan gained the support of many voters two weeks ago because of his willingness to engage the issues, while Dole was criticized for avoiding them.</span></p> <p><span>But Dole took a page from Buchanan's strategy book and articulated his own messages with increased clarity and forcefulness.</span></p> <p><span>\"[Dole's] vision got sharpened as a result of losing in New Hampshire,\" Weld said last night at the Colonade Hotel.</span></p> <p><span>After registering a protest vote last month, mainstream Republicans shied away from Buchanan's strong conservative views and returned to the Dole camp yesterday.</span></p> <p><span>But the ideological rifts opened during the primary--which have been widened by a barrage of negative ads--may not heal in time for the November election, according to ABC News correspondent Cokie Roberts.</span></p> <p><span>\"If there's a problem with supporting Dole, it won't be about negative ads,\" Roberts said in an interview with The Crimson.  \"If the party can't come together, it will be over general issues such as abortion.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "Castro Wasn't Wrong | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Since February 24, when Cuban MIG fighter jets shot down two planes piloted by members of a Cuban-American exile group, the American government and media have treated the relationship between the two countries very seriously.  On March 2, the Clinton administration announced that it would tighten sanctions against Castro's regime.  The press has focused on the technicalities of territorial airspace and profiled outraged exile leaders.  However, the national uproar over this incident has been ideologically and historically circumscribed, leaving most Americans with a lopsided view of Cuban-American relations and American foreign policy.</span></p> <p><span>When Madeleine K. Albright, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, passionately decried Cuba's downing of the unarmed Cessna planes, most of the nation probably took her indignation at face value.  However, if one considers America's long and bloody history of sponsoring brutal dictatorships and illegal invasions in the Caribbean and Latin America, her outrage seems ridiculous.  Of course, two wrongs don't make a right--just because the United States trained, armed and directed death squads in countries such as Guatemala for half a century doesn't mean that it cannot criticize Cuba.  But until the United States fully acknowledges and apologizes for its international crimes, Albright's outbursts will continue to seem preposterous.  Albright appears even more ludicrous if one considers that the U.S. ignores Cuban sovereignty by maintaining its colonial military outpost on Cuban soil--the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base.</span></p> <p><span>It is also interesting to ponder why the United States has become so vocal about violations of international law.  Just a decade ago, anyone who spoke about the thousands of peasants, students, nuns and priests who were being massacred in E1 Salvador was branded a communist.  The United States never called an emergency session of the United Nations when martyrs in E1 Salvador were tortured and killed.</span></p> <p><span>Anyone who has barely even paid attention to the media coverage of the downing of the exiles' planes now is probably well versed in the finer points of international law.  This detailed analysis seems particularly odd, for when the United States invaded Panama in 1989 (with over 23,000 troops), flagrantly violating the U.N. and the Organization of American States charters and numerous treaties, the press failed to subject our nation's actions to similar scrutiny.</span></p> <p><span>The media continue to ignore the violent history of Cuban-American anti-Castro exile groups.  The failed Bay of Pigs invasion was their largest operation, but by no means their only attempt to undermine Fidel Castro and his government.  With the aid of the CIA, the exiles sabotaged Cuban industry (oil refineries, chemical plants, sugar mills etc.) and attempted to assassinate Castro.  These exiles engaged in terrorism within the United States as well.  Actions such as bombing the Cuban Mission to the U.N. and attacking Cuban diplomats led the FBI to brand one Cuban exile group \"the most dangerous terrorist organization in the United States\" in 1980.  Their worst crime was probably committed outside of the U.S.; in 1976, a Cuban Airlines plane was blown up shortly after it took off from Barbados, killing 73 people, including the Cuban fencing team.  These acts of terrorism are no secret; they were reported in major U.S. publications such as The New York Times and The Washington Post.</span></p> <p><span>Brothers to the Rescue, the exile group whose planes were recently shot down, does not appear to be linked to prior violence.  Yet, since they recently dropped leaflets over Havana urging revolution, their missions cannot really be considered merely civilian.  To dramatize the seriousness of this action, would the U.S. allow Russian planes to drop handbills encouraging revolt over Washington, D.C.?  Furthermore, the Cubans claim to have gained intelligence from a double agent who infiltrated Brothers to the Rescue that the group was planning acts of sabotage.  In the full context of this situation, it is easy to see why Castro, who takes personal responsibility for the attack, would be a little quick on the trigger.</span></p> <p><span><i>David W.

{"title": "Require School Uniforms | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Last month, a group of New York pupils on a field trip walked into a Manhattan church for a black-history revue.  Although the stage held the main attraction, the fourth- through sixth-graders' blue slacks and skirts and white blouses so impressed adults in the audience that a few asked what private school they attended.</span></p> <p><span>Their principal, Bettye Howard, beamed as she informed questioners that the kids came from the public Jackson Elementary School.  As she told Newsday, \"The students came up to me and said, \"They think we go to a private school.'  It made the children feel good about themselves.\"</span></p> <p><span>Howard's story illustrates the wisdom of President Clinton's command to distribute guidelines to the country's 16,000 school boards on how they can require uniforms:  They are attractive, they emphasize learning over superficial trappings and they make kids feel good.</span></p> <p><span>Of course, there are detractors:  groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union, which protests that uniforms are unconstitutional; parents who bemoan the supposed high costs of uniforms; and children who protest that they will lose their \"individuality\" and \"personality\" if forced to wear plaid.</span></p> <p><span>Legally, the issue is ambiguous.  Although one wouldn't know it from Clinton's politically clever proclamation, school boards already have the power to require uniforms if they choose to do so.  But in Long Beach, Calif., which began requiring uniforms in 1994 for all 70,000 children in kindergarten through eighth grades, the ACLU has filed a case saying uniforms discriminate against poor children who can't afford them.</span></p> <p><span>Although uniforms can be expensive to buy, the cost-per-wearing becomes minimal after a few weeks.  And since uniforms are highly durable and tend not to show dirt easily, children rarely need more than two or three skirts or pairs of slacks and maybe five shirts.</span></p> <p><span>The question of free expression is less clear-cut than that of cost.  Many children interviewed in the nation's newspapers over the past few weeks, especially high schoolers, were vehemently against uniforms.</span></p> <p><span>\"Some people express their personality through their clothes,\" said Autumn Thompson, 14, who attends a New York high school.  \"I like to be unique.  I don't want to look like everyone else.\"</span></p> <p><span>And although a recent national gathering of principals showed 70 percent in favor of uniforms, many supervisors disagree.</span></p> <p><span>\"Kids are kids,\" Plainville superintendent James Ritchie said this week.  \"They need to be able to express themselves in ways that make them feel good about themselves and their generation.\"</span></p> <p><span>Feeling good:  the mantra of the school self-esteem movement.  What about taking away the baggy jeans, the snazzy sneakers, the ever-present baseball caps, the Ralph Lauren sweaters, and making kids feel good in other ways?  By raising their hands in class without worrying whether their peers are judging them by their clothes.  By feeling free to walk the halls and knowing they won't be attacked for their jewelry or their shoes.  By simply doing well in school and not being distracted by such superficialities as clothing.</span></p> <p><span>Uniforms will prevent clothes competition and the unnecessary expenses that accompany it, stop clothing-related violence and create an atmosphere conductive to learning and only learning.</span></p> <p><span>I went to a private high school where we wore uniforms:  pleated black watch plaid skirts and green, white or navy polo shirts for the girls, khaki pants and polos for the boys.  Nearly every other morning, I recalled my days in public junior high school, when I frantically searched for the right denim skirt or the perfect blouse, and counted my blessings that life was this easy and uncomplicated--at least on the outside.</span></p> <p><span>Uniforms may not be the most pressing item on Clinton's agenda right now, but they have an impact far beyond their appearance.  They create a sense of community, a sense of unity--and most crucial, they make school seem important.  Few other changes are so easy and yet so far-reaching.</span></p> <p><span><i>Sarah J.

{"title": "Clinton Administration Is Too Lenient Toward Castro | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Last week four Brothers to the Rescue pilots, three in their twenties and the fourth a 45-year-old father of a college freshman, flying two unarmed Cessna 337's were shot down without warning or provocation by Cuban MiG's over international waters.  Brothers to the Rescue is a humanitarian organization that patrols the Florida straits for Cuban rafters fleeing the island; they have saved the lives of thousands of Cubans fleeing Castro's tyranny as well as many Haitians during their emigration.</span></p> <p><span>Neither plane entered Cuban airspace, but the Castro government nonetheless authorized its fighter pilots to shoot down the Cessnas.  Recently disclosed transcripts of the communications between the MiG pilots and Cuban ground control during the conflict provide conclusive evidence that the Castro government, at the time of the shooting, was aware of the fact that the two planes were unarmed and piloted by civilians.</span></p> <p><span>The actions of the Cuban government are nothing less than a flagrant violation of international law and were fully planned and purposefully carried out.  Protocol in a situation in which a country feels that its sovereignty is being violated by incoming aircraft is to escort the aircraft out of its territorial zone, or, upon refusal, to make it land.  However, the aerial attack was unannounced and outside Cuba's twelve mile territorial zone.</span></p> <p><span>In response to the attack, the Clinton administration has decided to support a bill that will tighten the sanctions of the already existing U.S. embargo and suspend most air travel to the island.  It has also prompted an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council in order to obtain a declaration of condemnation against the Cuban government's actions.  The administration's response to the attack can only be termed as weak and hesitant.  We call on the administration to reconsider and increase the pressure on the illegitimate Castro regime, which is the most oppressive this hemisphere has ever witnessed.</span></p> <p><span>Haitian dictator Raoul Cedras came far short of killing one, much less four, unarmed U.S. citizens, but the Clinton administration nonetheless saw fit to replace his regime by an American-backed government.  The dictatorship of Fidel Castro has lasted more than 37 years and has repeatedly resorted to violence and oppression in terms similar to, and even harsher than, the deposed Haitian dictator's.  Last week's actions are only Castro's most recent transgressions in a long line of human rights abuses that have resulted in over 300,000 deaths.</span></p> <p><span>Recently, however, the Clinton administration has been affecting rapproachment with Cuba through various diplomatic channels.  The cold-blooded, premeditated murder of four Cuban-American exiles flying over international waters, less than one year after the sinking of the 13th of July tugboat--which killed 41 men, women and children--should provide a clear imperative to President Clinton to deal more firmly with Castro.</span></p> <p><span>On a more personal note, the Cuban-American Undergraduate Students Association extends its sympathy and sincerest condolences to the families of Armando Alejandre, Mario de la Pena, Carlos Costa and Pablo Morales. <i>--The Executive Board of the Cuban-American Undergraduate Students Association.</i> \u00a0\u00a0<i>Carlos A.

{"title": "'Super Tuesday' Brings Dole Near Nomination | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>(AP)-Sen. Robert J. Dole (R-Kan.) easily won contests in Texas, Florida and four other Southern states yesterday to gain a virtual lock on the Republican presidential nomination.  In victory, he reached out to his remaining rivals and said it was time to \"put our ideas together\" to beat President Clinton.</span></p> <p><span>\"Today, the American people  in seven states chose the conservative they want to lead America, chose the conservative they want in the White House,\" Dole told a victory rally in Washington.</span></p> <p><span>With House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) at his side, Dole stood under a banner that said \"Changing America Together\" and said:  \"We're going to move this country forward...get Bill Clinton out of the way and we will get the job done.\"</span></p> <p><span>Dole was defeating Patrick J. Buchanan and Malcolm S. \"Steve\" Forbes by more than 2-to-1 margins in Florida, Texas, Tennessee, Oklahoma and Mississippi.  The Senate majority leader also was handily beating Buchanan in Louisiana, where Buchanan's caucus victory in February triggered a surge of support for the conservative commentator.  Dole predicted Oregon would deliver him a seven-state \"Super Tuesday\" sweep and leave him with roughly three-quarters of the delegates needed to clinch the nomination.</span></p> <p><span>\"This is now a race between Bob Dole and Bill Clinton,\" Dole told the Associated Press.  Looking ahead, he said he had thought only \"in a loose way\" about picking a running mate.</span></p> <p><span>He made a conciliatory gesture to Forbes and Buchanan--perhaps hoping he could convince them to quit, or in Buchanan's case at least tone down his attacks.</span></p> <p><span>\"We've listened and we've heard strong messages,\" Dole said of his rivals, echoing Forbes' theme of economic growth and Buchanan's emphasis on middle-class economic anxiety.  \"It is time to come together now and put our ideas together and build a strong agenda for November.\"</span></p> <p><span>Forbes' dismal night had him talking of quitting.</span></p> <p><span>The millionaire publisher said he needed \"a win or something akin to a win\" in next week's Midwest primaries.  \"Obviously, we can't go to California without a breakthrough,\" Forbes of the March 26 contest.</span></p> <p><span>The also-rans were running far behind in every state.</span></p> <p><span>In Florida, for example, Dole was getting 55 percent to 21 for Forbes and 19 for Buchanan.

Lamar Alexander, who quit the race last week.</p><p>Leading GOP officials and activists tried to help Dole clear the field.</p><p>\"Now is the time to unite behind our candidate because we are going to have a tough election in November,\" said Jeb Bush, son of former president George H.W. Bush and a prominent Florida Republican.</p><p>\"Bob Dole is going to be the nominee,\" said Christian Coalition Executive Director Ralph Reed.</p><p>Dole's victories were lopsided and he clearly hoped Buchanan and Forbes would get the voters' message.

Dole (R-Kan.), always a master of stating the obvious, in reaction to M. Steven \"Steve\" Forbes' withdrawal from the Republican presidential race yesterday.</i></span></p>"}
{"title": "The State Must Not Kill | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b> recently had the pleasure of reading <i>Dead Man Walking</i> by Sister Helen Prejean.  Based on the title, I initially expected it to be about Bob Dole's presidential aspirations.  While that humor may have failed, Sister Helen definitely was successful in claiming that the death penalty should be abolished.  Although I was initially skeptical, Sister Helen ultimately persuaded me as she methodically shot down the strongest arguments for capital punishment.  Yet, in doing so, she remained sensitive, empathizing with the pain of the victims' families.</span></p> <p><span>Retribution for a crime against these families and society as a whole, is the most powerful argument for the death penalty.  Murderers deserve to pay for their crime.  As the Rev. William Barnwell, an advocate of the abolition of the death penalty, wrote last month in the New Orleans Times-Picayune, \"We must never be sentimental about the murder itself or the one who committed it.  Like the families of the victims, we must let the full horror of the murder fill our souls.\"</span></p> <p><span>Nonetheless, if we accept the premise that murder is wrong, it is improper to allow 12 jurors the power to deprive someone of their right to life just as it is improper for one individual to kill another.  We do not live in a society that literally believes in \"an eye for an eye.\"  For example, if a husband beats his wife, we put him in jail instead of hand-cuffing him and allowing the wife to assault him back.  Regardless of how reprehensible a murder may be, a criminal is fundamentally still human.</span></p> <p><span><b>E</b>ven if one believes that jurors should have the power to vote for the death penalty, what about the executioner himself?  He (or she) has the responsibility to kill another person directly.  One could maintain that he is comparable to a soldier following orders and thus, by killing the criminal, he is simply fulfilling his duty to a higher authority.</span></p> <p><span>Yet, if it is this simple, why during executions by firing squad (such as the one last month in Utah), does one of the guns contain blanks, not bullets?  No one shooter definitively knows if he fired the fatal bullet.  If the job of an executioner were morally justified beyond doubt, there would be no need to lift off any individual's shoulders the responsibility for the execution.</span></p> <p><span>A second argument for the death penalty is its deterrent value.  However, no causal relationship between the death penalty and fewer murders has ever been established.  Logically, do you think someone irrational enough to consider murder actually weighs the implications of death versus life without parole?</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b> common misperception is that putting someone to death saves the greater economic cost of housing them in prison.  However, due to the extensive legal fees of the appeals system, the death penalty costs more than three times as much as life imprisonment.  One could maintain that the appeals system should not be as extensive.  Yet this claim introduces the most powerful and most common, argument against the death penalty.</span></p> <p><span>It is possible, though unlikely, that a person will be wrongfully convicted and sentenced to death.  Given the lack of deterrent value and high economic cost of the death penalty, the risk of murdering an innocent person--regardless if it happens due to an established process--should be a clear call for the abolition of this punishment.  Very simply put, once a person dies, new exculpatory evidence is absolutely irrelevant.</span></p> <p><span>In addition, the legal system is biased against the poor.  Sister Helen states that a rich person will never sit on death row.  This claim is quite believable when one compares O.J. Simpson's defense with one by an underprepared public defender who takes the case of a destitute defendant.  And it seems especially unfortunate that when one has counsel that is incompetent in actuality (but not legally), potentially exculpatory evidence can arise too late for its acceptance by an appellate court due to temporal technicalities.</span></p> <p><span><b>Y</b>et, one could argue, can't a governor grant a pardon to a criminal if truly astonishing evidence surfaces at the twelfth hour?  Absolutely.  But the chances of a governor granting a pardon, and facing the political repercussion of appearing \"soft on crime,\" is minimal.  Moreover, in cases of capital punishment, ethical interests tend to succumb to political ones.  For example, Sister Helen claimed that Louisiana's clemency board was a direct extension of Governor Edwin Edwards' power.  Granted, Louisiana has a reputation for being more corrupt than most places, but no place is impervious to corruption.</span></p> <p><span><b>D</b>irector Tim Robbins does an admirable job of conveying the complexity of capital punishment in the movie version of <i>Dead Man Walking.</i>  The bottom line, in the words of the Rev. Barnwell, is that \"those of us who oppose the death penalty must be ready to face head-on the grief and anger of the families of the victims.  Those who are for it must be ready knowingly to kill a fellow human being\" as though they were the one on the firing squad pulling the trigger.</span></p>"}
{"title": "On State Business | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The streets of Shanghai glow from the neon lights of Coca-Cola and Gillette billboards.  In the Chinese cities, the Communist murals seem but a quaint reminder of the present government's origins.  The capitalist <i>zeitgeist</i> is present there and is growing immeasurably stronger each year.  So when I went window-shopping on the Bund three years ago, it was easy to imagine that Shanghai's earlier days as an international trade center had never been interrupted.</span></p> <p><span>Such is the effect of an American foreign policy that sees the national interest as the self-interest which is good for business.  In return for China's <i>yuan,</i> the United States will place its abuse of human rights on the back burner.  The Clinton Administration perpetuates Sino-American trade even at the cost of Tibetan repression, the suppression of free thought and the jailing of dissidents.  Dollars come before democracy when the pair cannot be promoted together.</span></p> <p><span>Secretary of State Warren Christopher was, therefore, appropriately attired in the businessman's pin-striped suit and power tie when he visited the Kennedy School yesterday.  To surprisingly sympathetic ears, he delivered a standard oratorio emphasizing America's continuing objective to maintain the dominance of U.S. business in the international marketplace.  Open markets, he said, will be the historical \"signature\" of the Clinton Administration.</span></p> <p><span>With the demise of the Cold War, visions of an ideologically-based foreign policy have faded into <i>realpolitik</i> understandings that it is trade which dominates the dealings of international diplomacy.  The starkness of our material world in itself isn't such a bad thing.  But it is somewhat disheartening to see the Secretary of State promoting open societies only to the extent that they open markets.</span></p> <p><span>Present barriers to the spread of markets include discord in Bosnia and the Middle East, the proliferation of nuclear weapons, the recent Mexican economic crisis, unstable democracies in central and eastern Europe and even the missing Vietnam prisoners of war.  Peace promotes prosperity; democracy promises dollars.  That is why we have a foreign policy based upon the spread of \"universal\" values of free societies and free markets.  That, Christopher says, is what will lead the world into \"a second American century.\"</span></p> <p><span>The Secretary proceeded to outline the Clinton Administration's capitalist initiatives for the upcoming year.  The foremost goal is to cement the \"implementation\" of trade agreements that promote the \"U.S. as the hub of an increasingly open global free trading system.\"  This expansionary mode includes a push to invite Chile to join Nafta.  Among the most original proposals was Christopher's pledge to assist American environmental industries in order to \"capture more of a $400 billion global market.\"</span></p> <p><span>Is the sale of environmentalism supposed to signal a newfound greenness in America?  Not anymore than the sale of missile defense systems is supposed to promote peace.  The unintentional effect of Secretary Christopher's speech was to smash illusions, and it seems that the great majority of the audience was in full compliance with the new revelatory attitude.</span></p> <p><span>But some questioners could not stand for such a morally disinterested attitude.  One man (who by a slip of the tongue called the Secretary \"Mr. Chamberlain\") asked, \"What irks you about Jews in the Golan Heights?\"  He was referring, of course, to Christopher's shuttle diplomacy between Jerusalem and Damascus to restore peace between Israel and Syria.  The Secretary all but dismissed the notion of this Israeli citizen's attachment to his land.</span></p> <p><span>\"This is not the end of history,\" Christopher theorized, \"but history in fast-forward.\"  Though he dismissed Fukuyama, the Secretary actually embraced the notion that industrial capitalism and its servant, representative democracy, will dominate the global marketplace unchallenged.  America's interests he unfortunately believes, lie in the glitch-free maintenance of the present order.</span></p> <p><span><i>Joshua A.

{"title": "Harvard Pols Need Vision | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b>t seems that hardly a day goes by that there is not an editorial or a screaming poster in the Yard that decries Harvard students' evident apathy towards political affairs.  To a certain extent, the problem of apathy is overstated.  An impressive 700 students showed up to the Phillips Brooks House rally to support the public service organization in its fight with the administration over an ultimately esoteric question of control.</span></p> <p><span>Nevertheless, at a time when the political debate that confronts us is of the fundamental nature of what kind of government Americans want, Harvard students seem, by a certain measure, to be concerned with little more than upcoming finals and papers.  Only a small segment of Harvard students are involved with the campus political organizations.  Harvard-Radcliffe College Democrats and the two College Republican Clubs both draw an all-too-small fraction of undergraduates to their meetings and activities.</span></p> <p><span>Yet sit in any dining hall long enough and you will hear students start to talk about the political issues of the day.  The dichotomy is striking:  Harvard students aren't apathetic about politics, they're apathetic about campus political organizations.</span></p> <p><span>The campus political clubs give students every reason to pass them by and retreat from political involvement.  Instead of finding ways to unite, the dueling Harvard Republican Club and Harvard Republican Alliance have been moving further and further away from one another.  The two clubs have been engaging in a vicious and personal e-mail war.</span></p> <p><span>This type of activity represents everything that people find distasteful and seedy about political life.  This type of bickering over minutiae only hurts both groups.  Of course, I can understand why the two clubs spend so much time weighing in on each other, seeing as neither has the program to meet the needs of America in the next century.</span></p> <p><span><b>O</b>ne would think that the Harvard Democrats would take advantage of the confusion on the right and work to attract disaffected moderates from the Republican ranks.  However, College Democrats have been doing the exact opposite.  Harvard's proud Democratic tradition includes the intellectual foundations of the New Deal and New Frontier, giving America luminaries and presidents from Franklin Delano Roosevelt '04 to Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. '38.  Today, however, Harvard Democrats are intellectually moribund.  As U.S. News and World Report wrote in November, \"At Harvard--long the cradle of liberal ideas and leaders--young Republicans outnumber Democrats 3 to 1.\"</span></p> <p><span>The real reason that Harvard students are apathetic about politics is the same reason why so few Americans vote:  people are tired of choices that offers no real choice and an electoral process built on voting against people instead of for them.  Our campaigns are about why we should be against Republicans, against immigrants, against corporations, against minorities.  Few in politics offer compelling reasons to vote for real solutions to our problems.</span></p> <p><span>A couple of months ago, the Independent asked the Presidents of the Democratic and Republican clubs to write pieces on why their party should be supported by Harvard students.  In his piece, then-College Democrats President Derek Ho '96 rightly lambasted Congressional Republicans for their actions in the past year.  Yet, he could seemingly muster up only a couple of sentences on why President Bill Clinton was deserving of student support.</span></p> <p><span>This weekend, College Democrats plan to go up to New Hampshire to canvas for the President's renomination.  Hopefully, when they stand in the doorway of New Hampshire voters they will offer a more compelling reason to vote for Bill Clinton than the fact that he has his finger in the dike holding back the Republican flood.  History has shown that elections are won by the party that shapes the intellectual debate.  But Harvard Democrats have been AWOL from any real campus discussion of issues and ideas.</span></p> <p><span>Even Ho has publicly acknowledged that political activity and debate at Harvard is dominated by \"single issue activism.\"  Yet new Dems President Seth D. Hanlon '98 campaigned on a promise to foster closer ties to the ethnic and minority groups on campus.  He said that these organizations must know that \"the Democratic Party speaks for them.\"  The Democratic Party must continue to speak for the dispossessed in our society.  But it already does.  Here on campus it is the vast middle that feels it has no voice and no one \"to speak for them.\"</span></p> <p><span>Upon his election as president, Hanlon crowed that he \"had liberalism in my blood.\"  At a time when the modern incarnation of liberalism has been discredited time and time again, Hanlon should stop bragging about his bloodstream and give serious thought to an inoculation against this scourge of the Democratic Party.</span></p> <p><span><b>F</b>or all of the Harvard College Democrats bluster about \"liberalism,\" their agenda is essentially a defense of the status quo.  There is a name for someone with this type of outlook.  It's called a \"conservative.\"  Harvard Democrats should adopt a true progressive agenda that speaks to the real concerns of our generation, not a mere echo of what the politicians in Washington's \"line of the day\" is.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard Democrats should eschew a knee-jerk defense of unpopular programs and instead focus on real solutions.  Instead of spending their energy protesting cuts in welfare, Harvard Democrats should talk about how to finally end the pervasive cycle of poverty.  Rather than fight Republican cuts in student loans, Harvard Democrats show propose ideas to throw open the doors to college to all those kept out because of escalating tuition costs.  Franklin D. Roosevelt '04 said that it should be \"the task of our Party to break with foolish traditions.\"  Harvard Democrats should lead the way in this process, not bring up the rear.</span></p> <p><span>Instead of discussing the solutions of the future, campus Democrats have spent their energy protecting the programs of the past.  If Harvard Democrats think that America and Americans are doing just fine, then they are right to single-mindedly protest Republican tampering with perfection.  Yet we all know America is in dire need of new ideas--and Harvard Democrats need to speak out with their vision of the future.</span></p>"}
{"title": "AND IN THIS CORNER... | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>George Bush drew a line in the sand on Kuwait.  Bill Clinton draws the line closer to home.  The President, capitalizing on his new reputation as the Arkansas strongman, took a tough stand against an old challenger from The New York Times, columnist William Safire.  In his column last Tuesday, Safire had the gall to call the First Lady a \"congenital liar\" for her obsfucation about \"Travelgate,\" her wildly successful commodities career and some obscure beachfront property in Arkansas.</span></p> <p><span>The old Clinton might have devoted days to Hamlet-like meditations over how to respond to much an insult.  Not so the new Clinton, bolstered by a fresh spine from his stands over Bosnia and the budget.  Such a man would not such an insult sitting down.  That afternoon he sent White House spokesperson Mike McCurry to inform the sports reporters in the White House press corps that \"The President, if he were not the President, would have delivered a more forceful response to that, on the bridge of Mr. Safire's nose.\"</span></p> <p><span>But why should the President be denied satisfaction on account of his office?  If the office allows him to testify about exposing himself to a former employee, surely he will not be denied the privilege of defending his wife's honor.  In the old days, he would have challenged that villain to a duel.  But in these gentler times, <i>mano a mano</i> would seem more appropriate.</span></p> <p><span>I foresee a new policy angle in the President's prowess.  Buying the President boxing gloves is certainly cheaper than an air-craft carrier.  Perhaps \"big stick\" diplomacy can give way to \"Big Bubba\" diplomacy.  After all, the President's girth is surely one of his virtues.  I would put our champion against any of those other so-called world leaders.  The war in Bosnia, the Japanese trade deficit and China's human rights violations could all be settled in a way appropriate for gentlemen.  I'm betting on Bubba.</span></p> <p><span>The budget deadlock being what it is, perhaps a good brawl would be a more appropriate vehicle to settle the dispute than endless negotiations over Medicare minutiae.  I could see it now.  Clinton is bigger, but Gingrich is quicker on his feet.  You call Don King.  I'll rent the steel cage.</span></p>"}

He said that inflation-adjusted family incomes are at the same level they were 20 years ago, and pointed out that real growth in national income has also declined significantly over the past several decades.</span></p> <p><span>In order to help tackle the problem, Lugar proposed scrapping the federal income tax and replacing it with a national sales tax.  Doing so would boost America's savings rate, leading to an increase in the capital stock that would promote economic growth, Lugar said.</span></p> <p><span>Indeed, Lugar cited one economist's estimate that a consumption tax would nearly triple the national savings rate to seven percent.</span></p> <p><span>\"Investments don't happen without savings,\" Lugar said.  \"It's sort of the old Econ 101 formula:  savings equals investment.\"</span></p> <p><span>Lugar acknowledged that a consumption tax would fall disproportionately on those with lower incomes, and he proposed exempting certain classes of goods (such as food and medicine) in order to make the tax more progressive.</span></p> <p><span>The senator, generally regarded as possessing enormous intellectual but relatively weak communication skills, criticized some of his opponents, including Patrick J.

After a short meeting at the Clinton/Gore headquarters to discuss the agenda for the day, they were taken to local neighborhoods to drop off campaign literature.</span></p> <p><span>The students distributed fliers for about two hours and were then driven back to campaign headquarters.  Students were provided with lodging in the local YMCA and returned to Boston on Sunday.</span></p> <p><span>The New Hampshire trip was coordinated by Clinton/Gore volunteers, who contacted the college Democrat clubs throughout Boston, asking them to help distribute material.</span></p> <p><span>H. Thayer Kinsberg, a Democratic state legislator from New Hampshire who volunteered to campaign with the students, says he believes the experience will benefit the students and American government in the long run.</span></p> <p><span>\"I feel if you become active early, it will be a lifelong process for you on a state and national level,\" Kinsberg says.  \"And you develop a sense of awareness which makes for a better government.\"</span></p> <p><span>The students who participated in distributing fliers say they hope their volunteering will help improve the government.</span></p> <p><span>\"I figure the future is in my hands right now and I'm going to do anything I can to save it,\" says Andrea Lin, a first-year at Boston University.  \"If [re-electing Clinton and Gore] means giving up a weekend, it's worth it.\"</span></p> <p><span>The New Hampshire trip gave some active college Democrats the assurance that they did everything in their power to help re-elect the president.</span></p> <p><span>\"It's important that people show beyond a vote that they support a candidate,\" says Dani Deigle, a first-year at Brandeis.  \"I want to know after the election that I did the best I could to get the person I believed in elected.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>Grassroots efforts</b></span></p> <p><span>With a bevy of Republican candidates, including dark horse publisher M. Steve Forbes, dominating the media attention heading into the New Hampshire primary, the trip provided college Democrats with the opportunity to focus more attention on Clinton.</span></p> <p><span>\"Even though there's no Democratic challenger, we're trying to show that there are people our age just as enthusiastic about our candidate as the hordes of Republicans that are up there for theirs,\" says Seth D. Hanlon '98, president of the Harvard College Democrats.</span></p> <p><span>Reminding New Hampshire residents about Clinton's policies during his term as President was one of the major goals for David Gruberyear, president of the Boston University College Democrats.</span></p> <p><span>\"While Americans over the next few months hear [Republican] debates over anti-abortion planks and repealing assault weapons bans, it's important to remind the American voter who's been fighting for their interests for the past three years,\" Gruber says.</span></p> <p><span>For others, the ultimate goal of the trip was to seek out new Democrats in a state dominated by Republicans.</span></p> <p><span>\"If I can convert just two people to vote for Clinton, that's double my vote to begin with,\" says Ronny Carney, a Boston University sophomore.  He says he distributed approximately 70 Clinton/Gore fliers during the trip.</span></p> <p><span>Local volunteers at Clinton/Gore headquarters in Keene rely on this kind of student enthusiasm not only to gain votes for the president, but also to cut down on the cost of doing so.  The campaign would have been faced with the added expense of mailing fliers to local households if students had not distributed the fliers.</span></p> <p><span>Both local and student volunteers regard the grassroots approach of going door-to-door and talking to voters as the best way to reach--and influence--people.</span></p> <p><span>\"The people who aren't on the grassroots level are the people who already care about what's going on,\" says Debbie Adler, a first-year at Brandeis.  \"Grass-roots is how you can get to the people who can vote, but don't get to do it on a regular basis.\"</span></p> <p><span>The heavy turnout by young voters in support of Clinton reflects the negative reactions of students to recent Republican stances on issues which affect younger people most, some member of the college Democrats say.</span></p> <p><span>Student aid was the major reason that one student gave for unhappiness with the Republicans.</span></p> <p><span>\"It seems the Republican party position is to cut student aid, which students obviously need, and that is why we flock to Clinton,\" Dan Carney says.</span></p> <p><span>Students mention other policies popular with young voters which Clinton has embraced.</span></p> <p><span>\"Things like establishing AmeriCorps, his education policies and his policies on environmental protection--Republicans don't have policies on environmental protection,\" Adler says.</span></p> <p><span>\"A lot of students talk about health care as an issue,\" says Dan Carney.  \"Many of my classmates aren't particularly rich and health care as well as financial aid are major concerns.\"</span></p> <p><span>Participating in Clinton's campaign allows college Democrats throughout Boston to interact with each other and express their views about the government.</span></p> <p><span>\"One of the added benefits of going to New Hampshire is meeting people from other schools,\" says Ronny Carney.</span></p> <p><span>The Harvard College Democrats have planned three trips in February with similar agendas.  Since students have now completed finals, the group expects a larger turnout of Harvard students campaigning for Clinton/Gore in New Hampshire.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard Democrats will once again be joined by their fellow Democrats from colleges around Boston.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Keeping an Eye on Radcliffe, Security, Tenure | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>he spring semester should prove challenging for Harvard-Radcliffe undergraduate women.  Following a fall term marked by safety concerns, upheaval in the Radcliffe administration and few female faculty appointments, students will have to work hard to ensure that their voices are heard in the coming months.</span></p> <p><span>On the heels of the announcement of the impending Radcliffe restructuring, in which the position of Dean of Students for undergraduates will be eliminated, female students must make sure Radcliffe continues to offer the resources they need.  Since the College has promised that the changes will actually make more funding available to promote new programs for undergraduates, it will be critical to make sure that the student groups and individual projects--from the Radcliffe Choral Society to Research Partnerships--which Radcliffe promotes will be enhanced, not weakened, by the changes.</span></p> <p><span>President Linda S. Wilson has promised that students will be able to participate in the committees that implement the changes.  Demanding that this promise is kept will be a crucial task for undergraduate women this spring.</span></p> <p><span><b>E</b>ven though changes at Radcliffe have attracted much attention, it will be just as important for undergraduate women to make their needs known to the Harvard administration.  Perhaps the most pressing concern facing female students is to turn the fear generated this fall by attacks along the river and near Mather House into positive strides toward a safer campus.</span></p> <p><span>The newly-formed Harvard Alliance for Safety Training and Education (HASTE) will sponsor Pizza Safety Breaks in each house during February to promote discussion about how the campus can be made safer for women.  In addition, self-defense workshops will be offered on a regular basis, and a Runners Alliance is being formed.  Campus safety will also be one of the main themes of the annual \"Take Back the Night\" week in April--five days of workshops and discussions about violence against women sponsored by the Radcliffe Union of Students (RUS).  A \"Take Back the River\" five-kilometer run will kick off the week, which will feature workshops geared toward improving feelings of security on campus.  All of these events will hopefully continue to bring issues of safety to the attention of the administration.</span></p> <p><span>Another area in which women must demand administrative involvement this spring is the hiring of faculty members who are women.  Each year, little discussion on gender disparity in the tenure process is initiated until Commencement time, when a Radcliffe reunion class makes noise about withholding its contribution because so few female faculty members have been hired.  Although groups promoting criticism of tenuring practices have formed both among Radcliffe alumnae and within RUS, neither has worked extensively with the Harvard administration to examine possible short-falls in tenure procedures.  After fall tenure announcements proved once again that men seem to be far more successful in this process, it is critical that this topic finally be examined closely.  To be on a campus with so many illustrious figures is a great honor; to realize how few of them are women is a great disappointment.  Promoting the appointment of more women as tenured faculty members is only one facet of a greater need for female role models among our teaching fellows, the authors of our textbooks and the theorists in our fields.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>his need for female role models is not limited to our campus.  Another male-only presidential race is taking shape, and the only national news about politically active women seems to involve the never-ending suspicions cast upon Hillary Rodham Clinton.  As a result, yet another challenge for campus women this semester will be to make the political world relevant to our lives.  The Institute of Politics will sponsor countless events this spring leading up to the November elections in which undergraduate women should become involved.  Aside from the need for more women on campus to participate in campaign work for the presidential race, many state and local races that feature women and candidates who support women will need our support.</span></p> <p><span>Radcliffe also will be sponsoring a number of events to promote political involvement.  The Lyman Common Room in Agassiz House  will be holding a day-long conference February 17 with discussion groups about how to turn the ideas generated at last fall's Beijing conference into practical action for young women.  Also next month is the annual Light-house Conference for girls, in which undergraduates host area high school students for discussions about women's history, self-image and potential for activism.  In late spring, RUS will host a weekend conference addressing women's health concerns.  All these events will serve as links between women on campus and the issues they face in the wider world.</span></p> <p><span><b>S</b>pring semester will no doubt be an exciting one for women on campus.  We will have the opportunity to translate the momentum generated over concerns last semester into action this semester.  It will be crucial for the leaders of the epicenter of women's resources on campus, Radcliffe, to be held accountable for their restructuring decisions so that changes are made for the good of the students and not the good of the College's finances.  At the same time, issues important to women on campus are not and should not be cloistered in Radcliffe Yard.  Concerns about safety, tenure and political participation will propel discussion for women all over campus this spring and will hopefully lead to significant improvements in the learning environment for all female undergraduates.</span></p> <p><span><i>Corinne E.

{"title": "COLUMN LEFT | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>O</b>ver the past year, people of our generation have come to realize that what goes on in Washington can have a very real impact on their lives and our future.  For this awareness, we Democrats have Newt Gingrich to thank.</span></p> <p><span>Never has it been more imperative for young people to get involved in the political process.  Nothing less than our generation's future hangs in the balance.  We have two choices.  We can sit idly by, watching politics as a spectator sport, as our collective future is sacrificed.  Or we can get involved and send Newt Gingrich and his cronies a message:  <i>We are a generation.  We have talent, energy and solidarity.  If you try to mortgage our future, we will not remain silent.  We will fight back.</i></span></p> <p><span>I do not have to continue for long to convince you that the Republicans' extremist agenda is tragic news for young people.  The original Republican plan to balance the budget included $18 billion in cuts from student aid.  Democrats agree that we must balance the budget, and it is fair to expect a wide range of people to share the burden.  But cutting student aid so drastically at a time when skyrocketing tuition costs make it increasingly impossible for families to pay for their children's education is the cruelest way to make ends meet.  Newt Gingrich calls what he is trying to create an \"opportunity society.\"  Yet he is robbing millions of young people of the opportunity to go to college.</span></p> <p><span><b>O</b>f particular interest to students, under the latest budget proposal:</span></p> <p><span>* President Clinton's National Service program would be eliminated, and with it would disappear the chance of four million young people to serve their country while helping fund their education.</span></p> <p><span>* Pell Grants would be cut back by a rate of one million students each year.</span></p> <p><span>* Federal student loans would be cut by $5 billion over seven years (that the cuts were reduced from $18 billion is a testament to the work students have already done in organizing themselves).</span></p> <p><span>* The direct lending program would be drastically rolled back.  Today, students can apply for a loan directly from the federal government simply by filling out a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form.  Students under the direct loan programs do not need to go through banks or other intermediaries.  It is relatively easy to know the status of a loan, repayment is more flexible and bureaucracy is fairly unintrusive.  As one university president said, \"It is rare that the federal government creates a program that both saves money and improves services to its constituents.  Direct lending is such a program.\"  Then why would Republicans want to roll it back?  For no other reason than that they are beholden to the greedy interests of banks and guaranty agencies.</span></p> <p><span>Sooner or later, but sometime over the next year, Newt Gingrich, Bob Dole and the rest of the Republicans are going to realize they picked the wrong generation to sacrifice to the corporate special interests that fund their campaigns.</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>e have already begun to come together.  Students who once considered themselves apolitical have in-volved themselves in the political fray.  Several students from the University of Massachusetts organized a student aid rally at Government Center in November, and we College Democrats were there to give our support.</span></p> <p><span>I will never forget the feeling of energy and generational solidarity that day as we marched through downtown Boston.  Students represented schools as diverse as Harvard, the University of Massachusetts, Fitchburg State, Roxbury Community College and Wellesley.  And even more significantly, the coalition of so many student groups with a single purpose told me that from our splintered society, people were hearing a unified cry:  the voice of our generation.</span></p> <p><span>People on the street eminently dressed in business suits and carrying briefcases seemed taken aback by the gathering.  In their eyes, the 1980s \"me decade\" was supposed to have thoroughly put to death the days of student activism.  What has happened instead is that Newt Gingrich has given student activism a surprisingly sudden resurrection.  Thanks, Newt.</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>e are a generation.  Let's put aside thoughts of our own transcripts and resumes for at least a little while.  In 1996, we have a chance to be a part of something bigger, starting with the presidential race.</span></p> <p><span>I believe in Bill Clinton.  I believe he is a truly great president, easily the best we've had in our lifetime.  As a man who will likely become the first president of the 21st century, Bill Clinton cares about the future--and that means us.  From establishing the Americorps service program, to protecting young children from nicotine addiction, to focusing on the problem of teen pregancy (in policies, not only in speeches), to stopping Republican attempts to gut regulations that will protect our environment for the future--Bill Clinton has demonstrated a commitment to our generation that reaches far beyond appearing on MTV.  He will not let student aid be trampled as long as he is in the White House.</span></p> <p><span><b>F</b>or the next three weekends, College Democrats and the Clinton-Gore '96 campaign will be running buses to New Hampshire for college students in the Boston area, free of charge.  The New Hampshire primary is a ritual in American life which happens only once every four years.</span></p> <p><span>Getting away from academia, taking a road trip, going door-to-door, interacting with actual Americans -- campaigning in New Hampshire is an experience that is exhilarating and even, if you are like me, spiritually rewarding.</span></p> <p><span>This is our chance, for most of us our only chance, to experience it.  I invite all of you who are on student aid or who care about the future of our generation to join us in showing our support for a president who supports us.  I can promise that you will learn more than you would by sitting in a Gov lecture.</span></p> <p><span>Most importantly, it is our responsibility to ourselves and to each other that we give our time, our energy and our labor for something bigger and better than our classes and our careers.  This year affords us that opportunity.  I am confident that young people will continue to be politically aware.  But for me, it is not enough only to be aware of what the politicians in Washington are doing with my future and the future of my country.  I want to do something about it.  I hope that you will join us College Democrats in helping to shape our future and renew American democracy the way <i>we</i> want it.</span></p> <p><span>Our parents made their mark on history three decades ago.

{"title": "Facts Amidst Appearances | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>It seems a hazardous moment to take up the editorial pen.  Why, only a few short weeks ago, President Clinton, responding through his press secretary to a column by William Safire that questioned the credibility of the First Lady, expressed a desire to direct his reply straight to \"the bridge of Mr. Safire's nose.\"  Yet, at the risk of leading myself into fisticuffs with the powers-that-be, I embark here on a journey as an editorial columnist.</span></p> <p><span>To find inspiration for this first column, I reread our very own Ralph Waldo Emerson on the duties of the \"American Scholar.\"  He delivered an address by that name for the Phi Beta Kappa ceremony here at Harvard in 1837.  According to Emerson, the responsibility of the academic is \"to cheer, to raise, and to guide men by showing them facts amidst appearances.\"</span></p> <p><span>This charge could just as easily be directed toward the American editorial columnist; it is his or her office as well.  In the Emersonian spirit, therefore, let me shine the light of conscientious scrutiny upon the President's recent State of the Union message.  There remain quite a few facts to be unearthed from the expertly crafted appearances of that evening.</span></p> <p><span>Indeed, I must credit President Clinton with an amazing ability:  being able to say something diametrically opposed to what he has been saying all along, while making it appear that he has held that point of view since the ark dried off.</span></p> <p><span>My favorite \"changeroo\" of the evening was his appeal, boisterously applauded by the Democrats in the chamber, for a \"line-item veto.\"  That was truly a show-stopper, especially for anyone who remembers the State of the Union addresses delivered by President Bush.  The appeal for a line-item veto was practically his mantra, repeated over and over again in the four such messages he delivered to Congress.  In those cases, however, the Democrats kept what must surely be their heart-felt enthusiasm under wraps.</span></p> <p><span>There was also the memorable, if laughable, reference to \"family values\"--an appeal to tone down Hollywood and an admonition against teen pregnancies.  I could just imagine a bewildered Dan Quayle watching as the same man who targeted the Republican cry for \"family values\" as his principle object of ridicule in the 1992 campaign now spouted it as if he had coined the phrase.</span></p> <p><span>And what about the budget?  First, Clinton gave the seven-year balanced budget proposal the \"silent treatment.\"  Then, he came forward endorsing a balanced budget--but only if the time-frame were 11 years.  Then nine.  Now seven--but those pesky Republicans are still \"extremists.\"  Funny, isn't it, that most of Clinton's by-now commonplace \"about-faces\" have been in the Republican direction?  One might well wonder whatever happened to the Democratic party.</span></p> <p><span>Fortunately, after Clinton's State of the Union, we have our answer.  The new standard of the Democratic party is \"yes...but.\"  It's the new fashion.  To whatever the Republicans say, the Democratic reply is \"yes...but.\"  On affirmative action, Clinton gives in but strives for balance in \"mend it, don't end it.\"  Mr. Clinton, should we balance the budget in seven years?  \"Yes...but only by cutting X; cutting X + 2 percent is evil and amoral.\"  Mr. Clinton, after your call for the end of the \"era of big government,\" may we assume that you now agree that your 1993 budget with its massive tax hike was a poor idea?  \"Yes...but it wasn't all bad.\"  In short, Clinton's strategy for the election year seems to be to draw the line where there isn't a grain of sand left to be found.</span></p> <p><span>Now, I am not a Democrat, but if I were, that address would not have assured me that the state of our Union is in any way satisfactory.  In fact, the only significant olive branch the President held out to the real Democrats was a call for a raise in the minimum wage--but details and proposals were not forthcoming.</span></p> <p><span>All in all, I came away from the address much more at ease.  It occurred to me that, whatever happens in November, we'll end up with a Republican in the White House.</span></p> <p><span><i>Eric M. Nelson's column appears on alternate Mondays.</i></span></p>"}

Malcolm \"Steve\" Forbes, Jr. is the latest super-rich prodigy to capture the attention of American voters.  Polls show the magazine fortune heir leading former frontrunner Senator Bob Dole in New Hampshire, the site of the first Republican primary.</span></p> <p><span>Why has Forbes surged into the lead?  Certainly not due to a warm personality or a charismatic speaking style.  Not a seasoned politician, Forbes often appears uneasy and awkward when speaking to or personally greeting potential voters.  He is adept at stressing an economic message but falters when faced with some of the moral issues that conservative voters want to hear about.  For example, at a recent campaign stop in Iowa, when asked about his position regarding same-sex marriages, Forbes hesitated uncomfortably and then stammered incoherently like a rookie on a high school debate team.  Yet, he has distinguished himself from the other Republican candidates with his claim to be a Washington outsider, immune from the bureaucratic mindset.</span></p> <p><span><b>F</b>orbes' main selling point is his support for a simplified tax code--a flat rate of only 17 percent.  While some of his competitors, such as Senator Phil Gramm and television commentator Patrick Buchanan also emphasize their support for a flat tax, Forbes seems to be the candidate most associated with tax reform.  Forbes actually speaks of little else than the alleged merits of a flat tax.  His message is little more than crude economic determinism--he professes that his flat tax will not only boost America's economic stature, but will also encourage a renewal of America's culture and values.</span></p> <p><span>While it is hard to imagine why a flat tax would curb rampant teenage pregnancy or clean up trash daytime TV talk shows, it is even more difficult to understand the economic advantages of Forbes' income tax proposal.  His plan would drastically reduce the taxes of the wealthiest Americans by slashing tax rates on salaries and making capital gains and interest completely tax free.  An example of the potential savings that the affluent would realize could be demonstrated if Forbes made his personal income tax return public.  While most other major candidates have released their tax forms to the press, Forbes refuses to do so.</span></p> <p><span>Under a flat tax, the middle class would pay about the same or even a little more in Federal income tax than they pay now.  Barring a magical supply-side rejuvenation of the economy, tax revenues would plummet, forcing further reductions in government services.  However, Forbes has made the flat tax the corner-stone of his campaign and it is responsible for much of his success.</span></p> <p><span><b>F</b>orbes' recent success may also be attributable to the weak field of Republican candidates--none seems able to capture the hearts and minds of voters.  Bob Dole, who once had a commanding lead in the pre-primary polls, has faltered recently.  Perhaps his decline is due to his public image.  One Republican insider recently described him as \"cadaverlike.\"</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps Forbes' candidacy has also been fueled by the news media, which has been itching to recreate the drama of the last election season.  A horse race between Forbes and Dole until the convention in San Diego is more interesting than a runaway victory for Dole.  With the revised schedule that compresses the primary process from months to weeks, we will soon know if a family fortune can really buy the Republican nomination.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Hillary vs. Dick | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Since the early stages of the Clinton administration, Republicans have attempted to keep the Whitewater issue simmering to discredit the President.  They attempted to bring the issue to a boil a few weeks ago when Hillary Clinton was forced to testify to a grand jury, but their strategy seems to have backfired.  Parading into court draped in an embroidered coat, the First Lady appeared almost saintly.  The Republican obsession with Whitewater began to look as if it was entirely motivated by partisan concerns.</span></p> <p><span>As public opinion turns against the Republicans who have been consumed with Whitewater, they are insisting that their investigation continue, because a smoking gun may yet be uncovered.  From the start of the investigation, they have attempted to make analogies to Watergate, claiming that only protracted investigation uncovered that scandal.  Hillary Clinton has been accused of being our generation's Richard Nixon.  For example, the cover cartoon illustration of a recent issue of the <i>Weekly Standard,</i> a conservative magazine, portrayed the First Lady as Nixon.</span></p> <p><span>Does the analogy fit?  Has Hillary Clinton ever been associated with anything quite as shameful as Richard Nixon's 1950 Senate campaign, when, brimming with anti-communist arrogance after sending Alger Hiss to prison, Nixon ruthlessly demonized his Democratic opponent as \"pink right down to her underwear?\"  Mrs. Clinton has been one of the most criticized, pilloried, and despised First Ladies.  Yet, has she ever launched into a bitter and embarassing tirade at the press, like Nixon, who in 1962, angrily declared to reporters:  \"You won't have Nixon to kick around anymore?\"</span></p> <p><span>If the Whitewater investigation continues, will the country really discover another web of deceit and hatred like Watergate?  Will we learn, perhaps, that Hillary Clinton ordered surveillance of her political enemies so that she might be able to blackmail them?  Or, maybe, that the First Lady directed the IRS to audit her rivals, and hired thugs to break into their offices, sabotage their work and steal their files?  Is the Clinton White House, like the Nixon White House, teeming with bribery and corruption, inhabited by cruel degenerates and characterized by an utter lack of decency and absence of respect for the Constitution?</span></p> <p><span>All these allegations could possibly be true.  But Hillary would still bear much of a resemblence to Tricky Dick.  To be a monster truly in Nixon's image, she would also have to bomb the hell out of Hanoi next Christmas, using large bombers instead of strategic fighters to insure maximum civillian casualties.  She would have to expose an almost inhuman lack of compassion by attempting to justify the slaughter of unarmed, non-violent students by the National Guard, as Nixon did after the Kent State massacre.</span></p> <p><span>I don't know too much about Whitewater, although I at first assumed that Bill and Hillary may have been responsible for some shady savings and loan business, like so many other greedy people during the 1980s.  However, the Clintons have not been charged with any wrongdoing relating to Whitewater.  While they certainly have committed their share of misdeeds in the past, these pale in comparison to Nixon's flagrant domestic and international depravity.</span></p> <p><span>Hillary Clinton, despite her foibles, is undoubtedly one of the most intelligent First Ladies in history.  Nancy Reagan, not exactly known for her intellect, was only able to offer the nation the insipid slogan \"Just Say No.\"  And Barbara Bush did nothing of substance until her panicking husband trotted her out to speak at the 1992 Republican national convention.  Even George Bush had to blush at this desperate and embarassing attempt to jumpstart his campaign.</span></p> <p><span>Hillary Clinton has been accused of wielding power without being elected and of benefiting from nepotism.

{"title": "The New Voodoo | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>S</b>ince the day he bade a tearful farewell to outgoing President George Bush, many in the Republican party have looked to Senator Bob Dole to lead the GOP back to the White House in 1996.  Yet in recent weeks, M. Steve Forbes, millionaire owner of Forbes magazine, has pulled away from the pack of Republican presidential hopefuls and narrowed Dole's once insurmountable lead in the polls.  Forbes, using a combination of negative advertisements financed by his millions and an optimistic, supply-side economic message, has now pulled ahead of Dole in New Hampshire and threatens Dole's lock on the Republican nomination.</span></p> <p><span>At the heart of Forbes' message and his success is a proposal for the creation of a single income tax rate that he claims will increase the efficiency of the economy and lead to higher growth without increasing the tax burden on the middle class.  Sadly, the facts do not support such optimistic conclusions.  In reality, Forbes' flat tax would either substantially increase the budget deficit and thereby fail to spur economic growth or increase the tax burden on most Americans.  Yet Forbes has consistently failed to point out these facts to the American people, a failure that we must not excuse.</span></p> <p><span>In particular, Forbes' flat tax proposal would replace the existing, progressive system of taxation with a single tax rate of 17 percent on all income earned above $36,000.  At the same time, his proposal would eliminate most deductions, like the home mortgage and charitable deduction, and exempt from all taxation unearned income derived from savings and investment.  These changes, Forbes claims, would greatly simplify the tax code and spur economic growth through supply-side forces.  This growth, moreover, would ensure that the federal budget deficit would not increase since the additional revenue derived from a larger economy would more than compensate for the loss in revenue that would result from a flat tax of only 17 percent.</span></p> <p><span>In reality the consequences of Forbes' flat tax do not quite conform to his supply-side rhetoric.  Admittedly the flat tax would spur economic growth.  By reducing the income tax rate to 17 percent and eliminating the progressive nature of the tax, Forbes' proposal would increase the returns to labor and thereby increase the incentives to work.  In other words, the average person would keep more of any additional earned income than he would previously and, as a result, would supply more labor.  At the same time, the elimination of all taxes on investment income would encourage people to save and invest which would raise the supply of capital.  Since long-run economic growth depends primarily upon the supply of capital and labor, the flat tax would increase growth and economic prosperity.</span></p> <p><span><b>L</b>ike all economic models, however, the beneficial effects of the flat tax rest upon the ceteris paribus assumption, i.e., that all other things held constant.  Yet under Forbes' proposal, ceteris paribus does not hold.  This is because his flat tax, which amounts to a massive tax cut especially for the wealthy, would substantially increase the federal budget deficit and overheat the economy.  Both of these consequences of the flat tax would serve to undermine and even undo the beneficial effects of having a single tax rate that exempts investment income.</span></p> <p><span>Despite Forbes' claims to the contrary, his flat tax proposal would increase the budget deficit.  Even he admits that his proposal could cost the government as much as $200 billion a year in revenues.  Given such a sum and prior experience with the Reagan era tax cuts, Forbes' claim that economic growth would more than compensate for the lost revenue cannot be taken seriously.  The Reagan-era tax cuts generated only enough additional revenue through the supply-side to offset a third of the lost revenues.  Forbes' proposal is unlikely to do three times as well.</span></p> <p><span>As a result, the budget deficit would no doubt balloon under his flat tax.  This would then drive up interest rates since the government would need to borrow more money to finance the deficit and to do this would have to offer higher interest rates to lenders.  These higher interest rates would then lower investment, which depends primarily upon the interest rate, and undermine the supply-side effects of the flat tax.  The end result, of course, would depend on the size of the deficit, but in all likelihood investment would decrease and economic growth actually fall.</span></p> <p><span>This problematic outcome would be further compounded by the demand-side consequences of Forbes' flat tax.  Historically, supply-side tax cuts that produce budget deficits, like the Reagan tax cuts, tend to have a far greater effect on the demand-side of the economy than on the supply-side.  In other words, Forbes' massive tax cut would substantially increase aggregate demand while only marginally increasing aggregate supply.  The result, of course, is inflation.  This higher inflation would then require the Federal Reserve to contract the money supply by raising interest rates which would also lower investment and hence long-term economic growth.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>he only way out of this conundrum is the implementation of a flat tax that would not produce a budget deficit.  Yet such a flat tax would require a rate of around 25 percent.  Once the various deductions currently allowed are taken into account, such a flat tax would result in higher taxes for the middle class and lower ones for the wealthy.  This flat tax would admittedly increase long-run economic growth, but it would also engender even greater economic inequality by undermining the middle class.  This would return us to the familiar world of the efficiency-equity trade-off.  More of one requires less of the other.</span></p> <p><span>Given this, the question of whether the flat tax makes sense really comes down to how highly the American people value equity relative to efficiency.  If they prefer greater efficiency and therefore higher economic growth to increased economic equality, then the government should implement the flat tax.  On the other hand, if they prefer equity to efficiency, then the flat tax is not worth enacting.  With this type of question, there are no easy or clear-cut answers.</span></p> <p><span>The American people must decide for themselves what they value more:  efficiency or equity.  But for the American people to make such a decision, their leaders must not conceal from them the harsh economic realities of this world.  There is no such thing as a free lunch.  In this respect, Steve Forbes has manifestly failed to do his duty and tell the American people the truth about his flat tax.  Instead, he has tried to fool the American people into believing that they can get something for nothing:  higher economic growth without greater economic inequality.  Hopefully, after four years of President Clinton, the American people will not place another liar in the White House.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Cambridge Is Right To Stop Teen Smoking | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>hanks to an aggressive effort by Cambridge's tobacco campaign program, it is now harder for young people to puff away their health.  A recent sting operation by the program revealed that the supply of cigarettes available to minors from local vendors is becoming increasingly scarce.  Of the Harvard Square merchants investigated in December, only 15 percent sold cigarettes to teenagers, down from 70 percent last February.</span></p> <p><span>This decrease suggests that merchants are heeding the crackdown on underage smoking passed by the City Council last spring.  While the city's method of monitoring enforcement--sending local teenagers undercover to purchase cigarettes--borders on entrapment, such measures are needed to combat the growing problem of teenage tobacco abuse.  Recent studies have estimated that more than three million minors abuse tobacco, leading the Clinton administration to call such widespread use a \"pediatric disease.\"  In a year when smoking among eighth graders is up 30 percent and more kindergarteners can identify Joe Camel than Ronald McDonald, the city's actions are not only justifiable, but desperately needed.</span></p> <p><span>Businesses that allegedly sold cigarettes to the undercover teens, such as the Hong Kong restaurant, will face stiff fines and risk having their tobacco licenses revoked.  A 25-cent tobacco tax approved in a 1992 statewide referendum both funded the sting operation and made smoking more expensive for teens.</span></p> <p><span>By giving merchants and potential teen smokers a financial disincentive to sell and buy tobacco, the city saves money in the long run.  The meager profits made by vendors on tobacco sales are outweighed by the societal costs of teenage smoking.  Each year 400,000 people die from tobacco-related illnesses.  A study published last fall found that each pack of cigarettes sold costs society 55 cents for additional health care and 14 cents for extra life insurance for smokers.  Most smokers begin their habits as teenagers; by eradicating the underage cigarette problem now, the city avoids the unnecessary costs of caring for ill smokers.</span></p> <p><span>As a result of the city's educational efforts, the only teens trying to purchase cigarettes in the future may be those sent undercover by the tobacco campaign program.  To combat tobacco industry advertising campaigns which target young audiences, the city has begun anti-smoking educational programs in local youth centers and schools.  Researchers have found that teens who have friends that smoke are twice as likely to light up as those that don't.  We congratulate the City on its efforts to crack down on smoking and hope it will continue the push to alleviate the problems of selling cigarettes to minors.</span></p>"}

{"title": "PERSPECTIVES | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>H</b>ow is the average rational but open-minded American to resist the opinion-framing tendencies of the media and to evaluate individually and fairly the First Lady of the United States?  The real problem for suspect political figures in general and for Hillary Rodham Clinton in particular is that more often than not, suspicion equals guilt.  Once the media casts its shadow of doubt across one's political resume, the practical verdict--namely, how that individual will now be viewed--is sealed.</span></p> <p><span>In the case of Hillary Rodham Clinton, glimpses of the shadow appeared the moment Jeff Gerth's article in The New York Times was printed on March 8, 1992, the first investigative report questioning the Clintons' involvement with Madison Guaranty Savings &amp; Loan and the Whitewater Development Company.  This report marked the beginning of the end for Mrs. Clinton, during which she would gradually be subjected to the grueling fate of a suspect politician.  Her political competence, integrity and trustworthiness were instantly colored by the doubt the media channeled to the public.</span></p> <p><span>And so, the public scrutiny she continues to undergo (but far more intensely than before) three-and-a-half years later recalls the extensive and ultimately destructive power of the press, of its ability to blur the distinction between questionable and condemnable behavior.  Mrs. Clinton is yet another victim of an illness inherent in our media, namely its inability to tolerate and accurately convey \"greyness\".  And it is in greyness, I'm afraid, where Mrs. Clinton stands today.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>t is certain she participated in some sketchy interactions, but the extent of her malpractice remains unclear.  Unfortunately for the public, but far more unfortunate for Mrs. Clinton, the media and the press, our noble filterers of political, social and economic information, do not know greyness but only extreme colorations.  The media cannot patiently await the resolution of her investigation and the possible certainty of her guilt; instead it must decide today what will only be known for sure in several months.</span></p> <p><span>The result of this inaccurate portrayal is the difficulty with which the public struggles against media-induced extremity, and attempts to formulate its own rational opinion of these \"condemned prior to judged\" politicians.  How can we fairly assess Hillary Rodham Clinton's status without falling into one of the two media-produced camps?  These days, it seems one must either join the majority in condemning Mrs. Clinton as a corrupt, adversarial Jezebel leading her husband into ruin or fight with the underdogs as a staunch Hillary Rodham Clinton supporter.  These are the two ends of the spectrum, carefully constructed for us by the press.</span></p> <p><span>The problem with extremes, however, is the omission of data.  While the predominant public opinion fails to recognize the holes in the attacks on the First Lady, Hillary Clinton's minority of unconditional fans are oblivious to some clear grounds for suspecting and questioning her behavior.  Again, Mrs. Clinton lies in a grey zone, a color to which the media is blind.</span></p> <p><span>So what have her many political predecessors done when their own suspicion rapidly flowed into guilt?  They resigned.  Political officials who have found themselves in a quagmire similar to that of Mrs. Clinton got out of office.  Gary Hart, Zoe Baird, Lani Guinier--a diverse handful of politicians who withdrew from the spotlight in which they were being stripped of their political integrity.  Our political system makes it too ugly for them to suck it up and stick it out.  They need to get out quickly and unscathed.  For the politicians who came before Mrs. Clinton, exit was the most common form of alleviating the public disgrace perpetuated and exacerbated by the media's disease.</span></p> <p><span>The problem for our First Lady is that hers is not an office from which one resigns.  Hers is not even an office.  She is not an official but a spouse, leaving her in an unenviable position.  Residing in a grey realm, miscolored by the press, but unable to leave through the emergency exit door to which her predecessors turned, Hillary Clinton is forced to stick around and endure the verdict, for all intents and purposes already delivered.</span></p> <p><span><b>S</b>o while the First Lady will remain before our eyes for a bit longer, we might wish to detach ourselves from the opinion-imposing tendencies of the media and to formulate our own assessment of her.  Since the investigation is incomplete and the facts of her actions unclear, it is premature to decide what she did do in the Whitewater case or how instrumental she actually was in convincing her husband to replace portions of \"Republican\" White House Staff.  Instead, there are two main issues which are crucial to evaluating her fairly during the upcoming weeks in which she will be investigated.</span></p> <p><span>The first began the moment her husband was elected and the public realized this was no Barbara Bush.  Hillary Rodham Clinton has revolutionized the role of the First Lady into one which makes use of the word \"lady\" seem very politically incorrect.  While legal malpractice and financial corruption are indeed condemnable behavior, asserting oneself as an intelligent, controlled and determined woman is not.  One must be careful not to confuse Hillary Clinton's \"unfeminine,\" agressive nature with a complete usurpation of her husband's power.  We must not condemn her simply for having a greater influence over her husband than did the Barbara Bushes of the White House.</span></p> <p><span>While many may be uncomfortable with a woman who has created a real sphere of power and influence in what was once merely a spousal position, such discomfort must not be the source of accusation.  Her role, like that of women in general over the past few decades, has been greatly expanded.  Let us not impede the First Lady from joining, and ideally leading, American women towards their long awaited sexual equality.</span></p> <p><span>And yet, this first issue, one which encourages us to be lenient toward the growing power of the First Lady, must be kept in check by the inevitable reality that she is an unelected official.  We did not elect her but her husband.  As Robert F. Kennedy '48 illustrated during the Cuban Missile crisis, unelected officials often prove decisive in guiding United States policy.  While Mrs. Clinton clearly cannot help being a source of advice to her husband, the American people have not only the right but the duty to watch her closely.  Unelected power is a frightening tool, for it empowers without prescribing a means of disempowering.  If Hillary Clinton has no job to lose, but only a reputation to tarnish, the public justifiably has cause for alarm.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>n the next few weeks, we must remember Hillary Rodham Clinton in each of these two roles.  We must not allow the innovative style with which she has been First Lady to translate an increasingly loud female voice and influence in the White House into an Eve or Jezebel persuading the innocent man of the house to do evil.  Putting the issue of gender aside, however, we must observe her closely.  An unelected official who has wielded as much power as she must know that with the seizing of such</span></p>"}
