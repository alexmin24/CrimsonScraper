{"title": "The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>It\u2019s no secret that this season\u2019s presidential campaign is one of the most entertaining (if not terrifying) yet. Watching the presidential debates makes one thing tremendously obvious: comedy writers will have prime material for the rest of the campaign season, and possibly until the end of time. We\u2019ve all seen Tina Fey\u2019s Sarah Palin and Kate McKinnon\u2019s Hillary Clinton, and maybe even dream of being on SNL (don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t have to comp any semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine to do so, even if their comp materials may lead you to believe so). If you\u2019re looking for an easier way to emulate the greats of this election season, here are a couple tips:</span></p> <p><span><strong>Bernie Sanders</strong></span></p> <p><span>Aside from the endless tirades against Wall Street and the \u201cbig banks,\u201d the name of Bernie Sander\u2019s game is waving your arms around like a madman, and shouting like one too. When in doubt, act like you\u2019re trying to get the attention of your friend from across Mass Ave while they have headphones in (jumping is also encouraged). While you\u2019re shouting about Wall Street (ignore the fact that you sent your resume to Goldman Sachs in a fit of desperation over winter break) throw in the word \u201cestablishment\u201d and the phrase \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d a couple of times and you\u2019re all set for a spot-on impression.</span></p> <p><span><strong>Hillary Clinton</strong></span></p> <p><span>Say what you want: she is the queen of shade. Hillary\u2019s mastered a suave, quiet way of telling people to sod off. Look at the snapshots of her in the Benghazi hearings, or stills of her face just before she rips into Republicans or Bernie Sanders, and take tips. Or maybe go in the obvious direction and try out her perfectly-rehearsed chuckle and her internal dialogue about being president. Whatever you do, don\u2019t forget the iconic haircut and pantsuit.</span></p> <p><span><strong>Ted Cruz</strong></span></p> <p><span>Make sure you memorize your bible verses and bring a note card full of jibes at the media wherever you go. Also, it\u2019s probably a good idea to learn how to stare into the deepest recess of someone\u2019s soul. Cruz has proven at every Republican debate that he\u2019s the king of awkward eye contact. And <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/us/ted-cruz-refused-hug-by-daughter-in-excruciating-video-a6846156.html\">awkward interactions</a>. And, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqpHTFJO4mE\">just being generally awkward</a>.</span></p> <p><span><strong>Donald Trump</strong></span></p> <p><span>Let\u2019s face it, if you can\u2019t make a Trump impression funny then the stage is not for you. Whatever angle you end up tackling this from, It\u2019s going to be \u201chuuuuuuge.\u201d I\u2019m not quite sure where the nearest wig store in Cambridge is, but if you\u2019re that pressed to emulate Trump, I\u2019m sure you can find a few hairballs in the corner of your dorm room and some yellow paint from the Freshman Art\u2019s Room. Finally, enroll in the new EXPOS 40: Bold, Brazen and Bullheaded, a Public Speaking Practicum.</span></p> <p><span><strong>Marco Rubio</strong></span></p> <p><span>Boots! Seriously, ditch the \u201cbuttas\u201d and combat boots and get yourself a pair of whatever Rubio was <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/01/marco-rubio-boots\">wearing</a> on the campaign trail. And while you\u2019re at it, it\u2019s time to put those public speaking courses that you took in high school to the test. Stand in front of the mirror, lace your bootstraps up and recite your most patriotic speech, while nervously <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/12/marco-rubio-love-water-216441\">chugging water</a> every few minutes. Just be sure not to accidentally flip flop; Fox News will be sure to catch it on tape.</span></p> <p><span><strong>Ben Carson</strong></span></p> <p><span>Honestly, all you need to do to be Ben Carson is just chill out\u2014and if you hit up your stoner blockmate to do so, we aren\u2019t going to judge you. Just sit in the back of your section with a muted smile and never raise your voice above a murmur. Always look very pleased with yourself. If you can spare the cash, maybe also commission an <a href=\"https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/ben-carson-jesus.jpg?quality=100&amp;strip=all\">oil portrait of you and Jesus</a> to hang in your dorm room.</span></p> <p><span><br></span></p> <p><span>At the end of the day, we should all be grateful to have such a cast of characters running for President. Good to know we\u2019ll be in <em>excellent</em> hands for the next four years.</span></p>"}
{"title": "The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>#ComptheCrimson because yes, you too can be a tacky cartoonist. It\u2019s a joke that\u2019s been done before. This Saturday morning, the campus was greeted with a load of recycled humor, with just a sprinkle of good material mixed in. Well, most of the campus...sorry to all the folks in Kirkland who got skipped over. You didn\u2019t miss much.</span></p> <p><span>Throughout most of the year, Flyby\u2014and the Crimson in general\u2014is too busy producing actual content to give much thought to The Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine. The fact is that they simply aren\u2019t funny; have you ever flipped through one of their magazines? It\u2019s the sort of humor that only people who spend their time in a castle plastered with basic neon signs would appreciate.</span></p> <p><span>Every now and then, though, they get lucky. Like this summer, when they <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/flyby/article/2015/8/3/lampoon-prank-trump-chair/\">pranked Donald Trump</a>\u2014that was actually funny. And occasionally, some freshman slips into the organization and gives them a dose of material not yet tainted by their dry humor.  This gets passed off as an annual <a href=\"http://thecrimson.co/\">spoof</a> of the Crimson, something <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/flyby/article/2015/2/4/congrats-lampoon/\">almost as funny</a> as that cat video on Facebook that your mother just tagged you in.</span></p> <p><span>The highlights:</span></p> <p><span><strong>ISIS gets Turnt:</strong> Only at Harvard do we find people willing to take that extra step and turn the recruiting videos for a terrorist organization into a spoof on housing day promos. All day yesterday, we were lowkey expecting some freshman to not realize the paper was a fake and drop a tip to the government that Harvard is in league with ISIS.</span></p> <p><span><strong>Dean Khurana, Denial is the First Step:</strong> Best quote: <em>\u201cSometimes I\u2019ll give the Fox a quick glance,\u201d a noticeably blushing Khurana confessed. Khurana was otherwise unable to comment for this article, replying to most questions with: \u201cClubs? What clubs?\u201d </em></span></p> <p><span><strong>Self-Important Op-Eds:</strong> \u201cMaybe It\u2019s Time to Stop Checking Our Phones and Start Checking Our Privilege?\u201d Yeah, this one actually doesn\u2019t feel too far from the truth\u2014can\u2019t you just imagine some drunk section kid slurring this to you at a party between rounds of slap-cup? Never mix socializing with your class readings, kids. Also deserving a mention is the \u201cBlack Lives Matter by the Poster Boy for White Guys,\u201d in which a probably yacht-loving, sperry-wearing, Vineyard-Vines-loving bro opines on the Black Lives Matter Movement, probably fresh off of the golf course at his country club. He\u2019s just glad he could contribute to the conversation.</span></p> <p><span><strong>An Abundance of (re)Virgins:</strong> Hands down the best article. This one goes out to all the Yik-Yak stalking, friends-with-benefits searching <em>thirsty </em>folks fiending for a quickie in the stacks who have been thus far unsuccessful. Props to the survey respondents for <em>finally </em>checking their emails.</span></p> <p><span>Bottom line: if you want to be part of an organization that only sporadically (read: once a year) posts funny content, then comp the Lampoon. But if you want to be a part of the Harvard College\u2019s OG publication\u2014and join your favorite student life bloggers here at Flyby\u2014show up at 14 Plympton St. this <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1255514541159711/\">Monday and Wednesday at 7 p.m</a>.

{"title": "The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>There are many ways to describe Donald Trump...we won\u2019t go into the details, or else we would go on longer than the Harvard Leads email chain. But whatever your preferred adjectives to describe \u201cThe Donald,\u201d his decision to dip out of this week\u2019s GOP debate may cause many to liken Trump\u2019s behavior to that of a small child. Albeit, a very rich, very <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/flyby/article/2015/8/3/lampoon-prank-trump-chair/\">gullible</a>, child with...interesting hair.</span></p> <p><span>Normally when dealing with a child throwing a temper tantrum, a person does one of two things: they either coddle the child (which is never a good thing) or they respond with tough love and don\u2019t give into the baby\u2019s manipulative cries. We aren\u2019t parents, but we\u2019re pretty sure that\u2019s baby basics rule number one.</span></p> <p><span>So when Trump announced last week that he was not going to attend the Republican Debate because he had beef with Fox News, and then threatened to hold a rally at the same time, how did other channels respond? Well, let\u2019s just say that the American media would raise some very spoiled toddlers. Instead of letting Trump metaphorically (or literally) cry it out, they hyped up his rally and even broadcasted a split screen of Trump\u2019s event and an empty debate stage in the hours leading up to the debate.</span></p>"}
{"title": "How Donald Trump Changed Our Minds | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Over the summer, Hulu\u2019s Triumph the Insult Comic Dog <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MubunsD-7g\">convened</a> a focus group of Trump supporters and showed them a series of fake Trump proposals somehow even more outrageous than his real plans. While they raise (alarmingly practical) questions\u2014how would you get a shock collar on every immigrant?\u2014they mostly nod and agree with at least the spirit of the proposals. If the idea is delivered in that sneering New York accent, they\u2019ll eat it up! It\u2019s good fun, if rather low-hanging fruit.<br></span></p> <p><span>The Donald Trump brand is a powerful thing: Even if it\u2019s not worth $<a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/20/whats-in-a-name-for-trump-it-could-be-33-billion.html\">3.3 billion</a>, it clearly carries staggering political capital among his supporters. Months before Triumph\u2019s focus group met, Trump had introduced an idea so far from the mainstream that <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-republicans-and-polls-enable-donald-trump/\">no pollster</a> had ever asked about it\u2014a ban on all Muslims entering the United States. Within the week, Rasmussen released a <a href=\"http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/current_events/immigration/december_2015/voters_like_trump_s_proposed_muslim_ban\">poll</a> showing that a stunning 66 percent of Republicans supported the proposal. But Trump hasn\u2019t just moved Republicans to the right. Trump has <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2016/03/31/3-views-on-economy-government-services-trade/#free-trade-agreements-viewed-positively-by-democratic-voters\">persuaded</a> millions of conservatives who assailed Obamacare, for example, as a government distortion of the free market that international trade has robbed us of our jobs and dignity. He convinced a Republican convention with its <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/19/opinion/the-most-extreme-republican-platform-in-memory.html\">harshest anti-LGBT language</a> in decades to nominate someone whose <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/04/21/donald-trump-says-transgender-people-should-use-the-bathroom-they-want/\">views on gender-neutral bathrooms</a> align more with Hillary Clinton\u2019s than their own. (By the time Peter Thiel gave his speech on the convention\u2019s final night, the convention cheered when he <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTJB8AkT1dk\">said</a> their new wedge issue was a \u201cdistraction from from our real problems; who cares?\u201d) When he suggested we might not defend our NATO allies in Eastern Europe, Trump defenders like Newt Gingrich <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-07-21/trump-s-threats-on-nato-commitment-draw-swift-white-house-rebuke\">hailed his foreign policy</a> as a practical, cost-cutting approach, a few short years after <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/15/opinion/gingrich-graham-ukraine-obama/\">skewering President Obama</a> for his inaction in (non-NATO) Ukraine.</span></p> <p><span>But the Republicans\u2019 Donaldic dissonance has wreaked symmetrical havoc on the Democrats\u2019 beliefs. As Trump denounced free trade agreements, liberals suddenly discovered Adam Smith. Between May 2015 and March 2016, the share of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents who believed free trade agreements helped their family\u2019s finances <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2016/03/31/3-views-on-economy-government-services-trade/#free-trade-agreements-viewed-positively-by-democratic-voters\">rose</a> by five percentage points; the share of those voters who thought they hurt their family\u2019s finances fell by six. This shift occurred, remarkably, while Bernie Sanders, and eventually an <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/08/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-now-opposes-trans-pacific-partners/\">unconvincing</a> Hillary Clinton, joined Trump in rejecting the Trans-Pacific Partnership.</span></p> <p><span>On foreign policy, even the president changed his mind, or at least his rhetoric. Obama rode into office on a wave of anti-interventionism in the wake of the Iraq War. In Jeffrey Goldberg\u2019s excellent <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/04/the-obama-doctrine/471525/\">article</a> on Obama\u2019s approach to global affairs, he writes that Obama is \u201cthe rare president who seems at times to resent [America\u2019s] indispensability, rather than embrace it,\u201d that \u201c'free riders aggravate [him],'\u201d and that he told David Cameron the countries\u2019 \u201cspecial relationship\u201d would be over if Britain didn\u2019t pony up the military spending.</span></p> <p><span>As often as Donald Trump calls the president weak, his foreign policy platform is based on a similar idea: NATO needs to start paying its dues, or we stop paying ours. As the Washington foreign policy establishment that Obama \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/04/the-obama-doctrine/471525/\">secretly disdains</a>\u201d condemned Trump\u2019s words, the president concurred. Seemingly rebuking his own strategy, he <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/289004-obama-trumps-nato-comments-show-hes-not-prepared-on-foreign\">called</a> NATO a \u201ccornerstone\u201d of our foreign policy; how outrageous that our sacrosanct commitments would be held hostage!</span></p> <p><span>Trump\u2019s conditional support plan represents, perhaps, a realistic approach to the limits of American power. It represents, alternatively, an irresponsible dereliction of duty from the sole remaining superpower with an aggressive and malignant Russia on the rise. But Democrats and Republicans flipped, seemingly without material changes to justify the flip.</span></p> <p><span>Why? Well, because Trump said it. Trump has so aggressively signaled his position in the culture wars\u2014on deeply emotionally resonant, identity-defining issues like race, gender, and national identity\u2014that he has become the nation\u2019s number one Good Guy for tens of millions of people, and the embodiment of evil for tens of millions more. More abstract policy concerns, like trade and foreign policy, as important as they are, simply do not move people like Trump\u2019s comments on immigrants. Rather than live in a cognitively dissonant world where Trump agrees with some of their ideas and disagrees with others, millions of people are changing their political beliefs to match or oppose him.</span></p> <p><span>Some commentators, like the <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21702750-farewell-left-versus-right-contest-matters-now-open-against-closed-new\">Economist</a>, see the world\u2019s politics in the midst of realigning from the traditional left-right split to an \u201copen\u201d versus \u201cclosed\u201d debate, citing right-wing nationalists\u2019 embrace of protectionism and isolationism. In this reading, Trump\u2019s rise is an effect, not a cause, of ideological shifts. White voters, especially those without college degrees, needed a candidate who appealed to their cultural values without ignoring, as, say, Mitt Romney did, their economic interests. (Ross G. Douthat \u201902, a former Crimson editorial columnist, has written <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/06/opinion/sunday/the-elements-of-trumpism.html\">some great work</a> on the ideological vacuum Trumpism filled.) As the Democratic Party increasingly comprises urban and coastal residents, on the other hand, their policy positions on trade would naturally become more sympathetic.</span></p> <p><span>But could such dramatic ideological shifts really have happened in both the Democratic and Republican parties since May 2015? More likely, I\u2019d argue, partisans strongly reacted either positively or negatively to Trump from the moment he declared his candidacy, and adjusted accordingly some of their opinions as he took positions. Maybe this putative realignment is just Trump wreaking further havoc on American politics, and when he fades from the scene, we\u2019ll go right back to normal\u2014until the next polarizing figure makes fools of us all.</span></p> <p><span><br></span></p> <p><span><em>Trevor J.

I am hit by a wave of deja vu.</span></p> <p><span>This time, though, two details are different. One: I\u2019m canvassing with the Harvard Republican Club. Two: We\u2019re not campaigning for a presidential candidate. After all, the Republican Club has refused to endorse Trump since Aug. 4, 2016, when it denounced Trump as \u201ca threat to the survival of the Republic.\u201d Its Facebook announcement has accumulated more than 133,000 shares and 189,000 likes to date. </span></p> <p><span>Nope, we\u2019re not traveling to Milford, N.H. for Donald Trump. We\u2019re going for incumbent Republican Senator Kelly Ayotte.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe don\u2019t think either one of the candidates is going to be a good president, so we\u2019re focusing on races like this one,\u201d Republican Club treasurer Kent Haeffner \u201918 says. \u201cThe president is going to need a strong Congress to stand up to them. We\u2019re focused on the big picture.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately, \u201cbig picture\u201d canvassing is a bit of a tough sell: Only four Republican Club members and an Ayotte organizer are here.</span></p> <p><span>The Ayotte organizer briefs us as we drive. Apparently, Ayotte is a strong opponent of the Keystone pipeline. She plans to crack down on the opioid crisis. She misspoke last week when she said she would \u201cabsolutely\u201d consider Trump a role model for children. The last bit of briefing is the most awkward: Ayotte has not yet taken a firm stance on Trump, and it\u2019s not clear that she will.</span></p> <p><span>By 11 a.m., I am standing on the shoulder of a one-lane country road in rural New Hampshire. The earth slopes away to either side of the road, merging with the hilly pastures below. Haeffner and J. Miguel Undurraga \u201919 walk quickly, and I have to scurry to keep up.</span></p> <p><span>A few houses in, Haeffner excuses himself to take a conference call. When he returns, he is bubbling over with excitement. \u201cMiguel! Miguel!\u201d he shouts, waving one arm and beginning to jog. Undurraga turns to look. Haeffner yells the news: As of 11:37 a.m., Ayotte has refused to endorse Trump.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI\u2019m a mom and an American first, and I cannot and will not support a candidate for president who brags about degrading and assaulting women,\u201d Ayotte wrote in a statement announcing her decision. \u201cI will not be voting for Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton and instead will be writing in Governor Pence for president on Election Day.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Haeffner and Undurraga are jubilant. They scour Twitter, rattling off every senator and governor who has denounced Trump since last night\u2019s scandal and hypothesizing who will be the next to go. \u201cTwenty-four hours ago, this was a different race,\u201d Haeffner says. #NeverTrump Twitter is going wild.</span></p> <p><span>By mid-afternoon, every female Republican senator but one will withdraw her support.</span></p> <p><span>Around 1:30 p.m., the Ayotte organizer picks us up and takes us to the Milford House of Pizza. I slide into a booth with Undurraga and a group of other Republican students from Dartmouth and Babson College, including Alex, a Dartmouth senior. </span></p> <p><span>Unlike Haeffner, Undurraga, and most of the Harvard Republican Club, Alex supports Trump. Also unlike the Harvard Republican Club, Alex is not a longtime Republican. \u201cI\u2019ve actually identified as a Democrat until recently,\u201d Alex says. \u201cBut I feel like the Democratic Party has moved too far left and is too focused on social issues and racial issues and not really focused on the economy.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Undurraga looks shocked. \u201cBut you feel comfortable voting for someone from either party, right?\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>Alex shakes his head. \u201cI don\u2019t feel comfortable voting for a Democrat right now,\u201d he says. \u201cThe Republicans, at least they have a conscience. A lot of them were reluctant to support Trump. Whereas, I never heard any Democrats come out and have second thoughts about Hillary. Do they care at all about character and integrity?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Baffled, I look to Undurraga for guidance. He has edged all the way back in his booth and is gazing intently at the table, ignoring his co-canvasser as best he can. </span></p> <p><span>***</span></p> <p><span><strong>Sunday, Oct. 9:</strong></span></p> <p><span>The second presidential debate hardly makes a dent on campus.

I think there\u2019s a culture of judging people for their political groups. Campus is obviously very, very liberal, in a very aggressive way. I just wasn\u2019t interested in being part of that conversation.</em></span></p> <p><span><em>LH: So why work for Hillary?</em></span></p> <p><span><em>SC: The media coverage kind of drove me to get involved in the campaign because I felt like it was so gendered. In [Women and Gender Studies 1225: Leaning In, Hooking Up: Visions of Feminism and Femininity in the 21st Century] we spoke a lot about caricatures, and when I turned on the news I saw it: an untrustworthy powerful woman. I\u2019m tired of the caricature. It\u2019s old and it\u2019s tired. Electing the first female president? It\u2019s about damn time. </em></span></p> <p><span><em>LH: How does digital marketing affect the campaign?</em></span></p> <p><span><em>SC: We do all the paid digital advertising\u2014the Facebook advertising and Twitter advertising and Snapchat advertising.

We\u2019re targeting these ads towards certain demographics to make sure we\u2019re reaching people in the most effective way.</em></span></p> <p><span><em>LH: Which demographics do you target?</em></span></p> <p><span><em>SC: We\u2019re looking for the people who are likely to vote for us [but] are a) not going to turn out or b) going to vote for a third party candidate. Millennials are a big target demographic for us. Also independents, swing voters, moderate Republicans. We\u2019re far more interested in those people.</em></span></p> <p><span><em>The campaign isn\u2019t concerned about Trump supporters, because at the end of the day they\u2019re going to support Trump. He could walk down on Fifth Avenue and shoot someone and his supporters would be like \u201cSecond Amendment rights!\u201d and they\u2019d stand by him.

It was meant to be satire.\u201d That was the moment I realized that being able to laugh at Donald Trump is a product of your privilege.

In a lot of other places, maybe young people don\u2019t sit around talking about politics, but I\u2019ve always found that people are very willing to engage at Harvard. People don\u2019t shy away from these serious discussions, and people don\u2019t lose friends.

Calm, polished, thoughtful. About 10 notches less exuberant than Chitika. In fact, it\u2019s not until I\u2019m halfway back to Boston that I realize I didn\u2019t learn anything about her politics.

Only a few Republican Club members are here so far. They tap away at their laptops in relative silence. The minutes pass slowly until I notice the patriotic mini-cupcakes scattered about and slip out to investigate.</span></p> <p><span>As it turns out, the FDR room opens directly onto the JFK Junior Forum, where a crowd is watching on a larger screen. I spot a friend in the crowd and sit down with her.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cLook at that pantsuit!\u201d my friend hisses in my ear, pointing to the scene being projected above us. Clinton emerges from her SUV, dressed in blinding white. \u201cShe looks so presidential.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The opening comments begin and I scurry back to the Republican Club\u2019s room. As I enter, someone points at Clinton. \u201cLook at that pantsuit!\u201d she says. \u201cShe looks like a bedsheet.\u201d Laughter ripples among the 15 or 20 people in the room.</span></p> <p><span>I begin to get nervous. I\u2019ve never really heard anyone on campus make fun of Clinton before. </span></p> <p><span>The second laugh, though, is at Trump\u2019s expense (\u201cwrong!\u201d). So is the third (\u201cbad hombres\u201d). So is the fourth (after Trump refuses to accept the results of the election if he loses)\u2014although it\u2019s more of a mass gasp than a laugh.</span></p> <p><span>The rest of the time, the FDR room is silent. It\u2019s not the attentive silence of the first debate at the Science Center, nor is it the disinterested silence of the second debate.

To me, it seems that such losses coincide with rising concerns about a fragmented community, and I don\u2019t think that this is accidental.</span></p> <p><span>In the past month alone, students have had to make do without dining halls as centers of house life; Harvard\u2019s administration has <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/9/28/univ-committee-diversity-inclusion/\">decided</a> to create a task force to investigate diversity and inclusivity on campus; and The Crimson has <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/10/12/zhang-on-community/\">published</a> <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/column/new-romantix/article/2016/9/26/home-girlhood-college/\">multiple</a> <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/column/adventures-of-a-non-resident-alien/article/2016/9/28/homesickness-ceteris-paribus/\">op-eds</a> concerned with home and community. These events and many others fit into the larger narrative that the University has especially struggled with since President Faust took the reins: namely, that there is supposed to be <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/5/29/one-harvard-one-campaign/?page=single\">One Harvard</a>.</span></p> <p><span>These concerns of unifying Harvard are also based on a concern that Harvard is losing its ability to set up its students for success. The University campaign to create One Harvard is <a href=\"http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2013/05/one-harvard/\">motivated</a> by the idea that the disparate parts of Harvard working in unison will make for a greater, more successful whole. And those who are concerned with a fragmented community\u2014whether caused by a lack of initiative on the part of students to create meaningful relationships, or by a strike that has split dining hall workers, students, and the administration into different camps\u2014also implicitly identify the need for consistent and unified support systems in success.</span></p> <p><span>Looking at Harvard\u2019s past, it seems like a homogeneity that is conducive to success has contributed to a large part of its achievements. The fact that many of Boston\u2019s WASP-y Brahmin class sent their boys to Harvard made for a school composed of people with similar values and goals. And with these similar values and goals, it\u2019s easy to imagine how a united Harvard was able to rise as a bastion of success and excellent education.</span></p> <p><span>Nowadays, our expectation for Harvard to breed an elite is tempered by the fact that it is much more diverse in terms of class, gender, ethnicity, and geographic location, a fact that we can attribute to a globalized world governed by global standards that requires Harvard to look far and wide for the best. And to assimilate such a diverse group of students under the banner of Harvard takes much more work than simply admitting them, as some students have realized. It has not been until recently that Harvard has <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/4/20/freshman-enrichment-program-chosen/\">decided</a> to fund an orientation program to help incoming freshmen from under-resourced high schools become accustomed to Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>In some ways, one could say our concerns about a lack of community in a place that creates elites are not all that different from the concerns of those who have committed themselves to Making America Great Again.</span></p> <p><span>The story I have just told of Harvard seems to parallel a story told of the U.S., where a small country quickly rose to power and is now facing problems in its ability to keep a diverse nation together and thriving. Trump supporters seem to believe such a narrative, as they have been <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2016/10/25/a-majority-of-donald-trump-supporters-think-everything-has-been-terrible-since-the-1950s/\">shown</a> to believe that America has declined since the 1950\u2019s, whatever their reasons. And as I have tried to explain, such a narrative can easily apply to Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>Regardless of whether or not Trump supporters are right about America\u2019s decline, or whether or not I am right in pointing out potential signs of Harvard\u2019s decline, they are concerned with the same fragility of success in the country that we are concerned with when we talk of community and unity at Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>However, to return to strength doesn\u2019t mean we have to resort to Harvard\u2019s old ways when it was male and white. In fact, the world we live in today requires us to think of new ways to unify an increasingly diverse set of students to set them up for success.</span></p> <p><span><br></span></p> <p><span><em>Dan A.

Kennedy Jr. Forum.</span></p> <p><span>Vargas came into the public spotlight in 2011 after he published an essay in the New York Times Magazine discussing his life in the United States as an undocumented immigrant. Having moved from the Philippines to live with his grandparents in Mountain View, Calif. when he was 12, Vargas did not know he was living in the United States illegally until he was 16 years old.</span></p> <p><span>Shortly after the publication of his 2011 piece, Vargas called the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to ask why he had not been deported. He said he was told \u201cthe Department refuses to comment on specific cases.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Vargas highlighted what he said were contradictions in the way the government and American citizens treat immigrants. He said that undocumented immigrants pay money to the government, yet the government spends almost as much to keep them out of the country.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAn estimated seven million undocumented workers have paid about $100 billion in Social Security taxes using fake Social Security numbers,\u201d he said. \u201cYet since 9/11 we have invested $100 billion in border security.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Vargas said Americans need to alter the way they understand immigration before being able to enter into an informed discussion on immigration policy. He said he thought the terminology the media uses to discuss immigration \u201cdehumanizes and marginalizes immigrants.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cJournalism schools are going to study the failure of the mainstream media of contextualizing [immigration]. We in the news media have bought into the story that Trump has sold the media,\u201d Vargas said. \u201cThe New York Times doesn\u2019t even talk about it. The framing of the issue has been wrong, just wrong.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Vargas\u2019s  remarks were well-received by members of the audience.</span></p> <p><span>Zid N.

Ramsey Fahs", "body": "<p><span>In what appears to have been a yearly team tradition, a member of Harvard\u2019s 2012 men\u2019s soccer team produced a document that, in sexually explicit terms, individually assessed and evaluated freshmen recruits from the 2012 women\u2019s soccer team based on their perceived physical attractiveness and sexual appeal.</span></p> <p><span>The author and his teammates referred to the nine-page document as a \u201cscouting report,\u201d and the author circulated the document over the group\u2019s email list on July 31, 2012.</span></p> <p><span>In lewd terms, the author of the report individually evaluated each female recruit, assigning them numerical scores and writing paragraph-long assessments of the women. The document also included photographs of each woman, most of which, the author wrote, were culled from Facebook or the Internet. </span></p> <p><span>The author of the \u201creport\u201d often included sexually explicit descriptions of the women. He wrote of one woman that \u201cshe looks like the kind of girl who both likes to dominate, and likes to be dominated.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Each woman was assigned a hypothetical sexual \u201cposition\u201d in addition to her position on the soccer field.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cShe seems relatively simple and probably inexperienced sexually, so I decided missionary would be her preferred position,\u201d the author wrote about one woman. \u201cDoggy style,\u201d \u201cThe Triple Lindy,\u201d and \u201ccowgirl\u201d were listed as possible positions for other women.</span></p> <p><span>The author also assigned each woman a nickname, calling one woman \u201cGumbi\u201d because \u201cher gum to tooth ratio is about 1 to 1.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cFor that reason I am forced to rate her a 6,\u201d the author added.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cShe seems to be very strong, tall and manly so, I gave her a 3 because I felt bad. Not much needs to be said on this one folks,\u201d the author wrote about another woman.</span></p> <p><span>Concluding his assessment of one woman, the author wrote, \u201cYeah\u2026 She wants cock.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The \u201creport\u201d appears to have been an annual practice. At the beginning of the document, the author writes that \u201cwhile some of the scouting report last year was wrong, the overall consensus that\u201d a certain player \u201cwas both the hottest <em>and</em> the most STD ridden was confirmed.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Several members of the 2012 men\u2019s team declined to comment on the document, including whether subsequent men\u2019s soccer teams continued to create similar \u201creports.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Before the document was sent out to the team, an older member had emailed the list ordering that \u201csomeone man up and send out a proper scouting report on the incoming freshman [sic] for girl\u2019s team.\u201d Responding to that email, another teammate addressed the author, writing \u201cwhat the fuck where are you on this?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>When the document was sent, several members of the team responded to the email. One member expressed approval of the document, writing \u201chahahahaha well done.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The document and the entire email list the team used that season were, until recently, publicly available and searchable through Google Groups, an email list-serv service offered through Google.</span></p> <p><span>Director of Athletics Robert L. Scalise viewed the document for the first time Monday and said he had been unaware of the document until then.</span></p> <p><span>Directly after seeing the document, he said \u201cAny time a member of our community says things about other people who are in our community that are disparaging, it takes away from the potential for creating the kind of learning environment that we\u2019d like to have here at Harvard.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>He added: \u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing and disturbing that people are doing this.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Scalise said the document reflects issues that extend far beyond Harvard\u2019s campus.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe\u2019re not insulated from these types of things,\u201d he said. \u201cThese things exist in our society. Society hasn't figured out a way to stop these things from happening.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhenever you have groups of people that come together there\u2019s a potential for this to happen,\u201d Scalise added.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt could be an individual, it could be a group, it could be a rooming group, it could be an athletic team,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Pressed on whether the \u201cscouting report\u201d affected campus culture beyond impacting \u201cthe kind of learning environment\u201d that Scalise described, he said \u201cI don\u2019t have a comment on that right now. I have to think about it a little.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe need a little bit of time to just think about it and not rush to anything,\u201d Scalise said. \u201cBut it\u2019s totally inappropriate and disturbing.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Though Scalise said his first steps for responding to the document would \u201ccertainly\u201d include speaking to coaches of both men\u2019s and women\u2019s athletic teams, he added that \u201cthere\u2019s a role for the administration at the College to also play in this\u201d in addition to the athletics department.</span></p> <p><span>Any reaction to the document, though, should be \u201can internal Harvard matter,\u201d Scalise said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis is not a media thing,\u201d Scalise said. \u201cThis is something that should be looked at by us in the administration to figure out what our steps are, but we shouldn\u2019t do anything more with the media on this other than \u2018thank you for letting us know about this, okay. We need to look at it.\u2019\u201d</span></p> <p><span>First contacted about the document late Friday afternoon, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana did not respond to multiple requests for an in-person meeting to view the document. College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an email that Khurana was unavailable for an in-person interview. Khurana instead emailed a statement, after Dane had viewed the document herself in person.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAs a human being, and a member of the Harvard College community, I am always profoundly disturbed and upset by allegations of sexism, because I feel it is wrong and antithetical to this institution\u2019s fundamental values,\u201d Khurana wrote. \u201cNo one should be objectified. In light of all the attention that has been given to issues of inclusion, gender equity, and personal integrity at Harvard and elsewhere, we must work together to build a community of which we can all be proud.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Khurana also wrote that because \u201cI was not Dean of Harvard College in 2012 and do not have knowledge of this particular email, I cannot speak to the alleged conduct of these particular students.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Evelynn M. Hammonds, who was the Dean of the College in 2012, deferred comment to Dane.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhen I first heard of this report from the Crimson, I was shocked and disgusted,\u201d wrote current Men\u2019s Soccer Coach Pieter S. Lehrer in a statement provided by Director of Athletic Communications Tim Williamson. \u201cI will take this opportunity to address this document from 2012 with my current athletes. I hope their seeing how offensive and hurtful this is will be a valuable lesson for everyone involved with this program.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Neither Lehrer, who was not the men\u2019s soccer coach at the time of the 2012 email, nor the team\u2019s current captains responded directly to inquiries as to whether there were \u201creports\u201d produced after 2012.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe information contained in this document from 2012 is unacceptable, and I am saddened to see this level of disrespect shown to these women,\u201d wrote Women\u2019s Soccer Coach Christopher P. Hamblin in an emailed statement, adding that \u201csince Coach Lehrer's hire in 2013, I have seen a huge shift in the culture of the men's soccer program at Harvard.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The document, though written four years ago, surfaces amid a year at Harvard defined, in many ways, by campus discourse about gender equity and campus sexual harassment. It also comes at a time in which national conversations on the current presidential campaign focus on the same subject. After the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-recorded-having-extremely-lewd-conversation-about-women-in-2005/2016/10/07/3b9ce776-8cb4-11e6-bf8a-3d26847eeed4_story.html\">surfacing of a 2005 tape</a> in which Republican presidential nominee Donald J.

{"title": "Is the American University Ready for Donald Trump? | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>In a year of the unexpected, one thing surprises me more than anything else: Cosmopolitan America is trying to take the white working class seriously.<br></span></p> <p><span>The white working class has spoken. It spoke for Bernie Sanders and it spoke for Donald Trump. And so in the run-up to Election Day, the media\u2019s been churning out feature after feature on \u201cforgotten middle America.\u201d Even <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2016-10-17/great-white-nope\">Foreign Affairs</a> is getting in on the action!</span></p> <p><span>But at Harvard, cosmopolitan America\u2019s most famous training ground, while there are plenty of Sanders voters to be found, there are almost no Trump supporters at all.</span></p> <p><span>You\u2019d think that Harvard would try to understand Trumpism better\u2014it\u2019s chock-full of sympathetic, unobjectionable liberals who often agree with Trump on free trade and campaign finance. But Harvard the University has trouble processing the Trump phenomenon because Harvard the Admissions Office and Harvard the Research Institution are not particularly interested in the archetypal white working-class Trump voter. The last 18 months have demonstrated that the sentiment is wholly reciprocated. And that\u2019s a shame, because Harvard has so much to contribute to our understanding of Trump\u2019s rise.</span></p> <p><span>The first bone Trump\u2019s original base has to pick with Harvard is that it is unrepresentative, particularly with respect to them. The slogan of Trumpism is \u201cunfair\u201d\u2014unfair racial preferences, unfair trade deals, unfair Supreme Court decisions, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/21/us/politics/campaign-election-trump-clinton.html\">unfair elections</a>, unfair everything. And the truth is that if working-class and lower-middle-class Trumpites (in my experience, the most fervent kind of Trump supporter), understood how unrepresentative Harvard is they would try to burn it to the ground.</span></p> <p><span>Income is a popular talking point, and last year, the <a href=\"http://features.thecrimson.com/2016/senior-survey/\">median</a> Harvard senior was raised in a household <a href=\"http://features.thecrimson.com/2016/senior-survey/demographics/\">making more than $125,000 a year</a>. That\u2019s two and a half times greater than <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEHOINUSA672N\">the national median</a>.</span></p> <p><span>Moreover, if there\u2019s a working-class student at Harvard, that person\u2019s very unlikely to be white. We can argue whether race-based affirmative action is a good thing. We cannot deny that the way Harvard does it, race-based affirmative action disproportionately hurts the white working class because it is not coupled with a sufficient commitment to economically based affirmative action. Poor white people are just as incapable of paying for test prep as poor minorities, after all. If you don\u2019t see classic Trump voters around campus, it\u2019s not because they don\u2019t want to be here, it\u2019s because we won\u2019t let them in. Last year, only <a href=\"http://features.thecrimson.com/2016/senior-survey/demographics/\">8.9 percent of white Harvard seniors</a> were first-generation college students (not a perfect stand-in for class, but close enough). This is even smaller than the figure for South Asians (10 percent), the single wealthiest ethnic group in the United States. (If you were wondering, Hispanics are at 33 percent.) With barely any representation from Trump\u2019s demographic base, how exactly can a student community like Harvard\u2019s approach the Trump phenomenon in any intellectually rigorous way? As prejudiced as many of Trump\u2019s views have been, if we are not going to provide a forum where we can approach them head-on, we are not going to figure out how to change anybody\u2019s minds. That process starts with taking an honest look at why Trumpites vote the way they do. We can\u2019t do that without actually meeting Trump voters, and students just can\u2019t do that here. If we brought in more students who are demographically likelier to vote Trump, we\u2019d dim the flames of Trumpism a little, and we\u2019d learn about Trump voters a lot.</span></p> <p><span>The second big issue is that Trumpism is in large part a rejection of experts, and in 2016 Trump\u2019s voters fervently rejected the sort of policy wonks that tend to congregate at places like Harvard. The kneejerk reaction is to cry anti-intellectualism. There\u2019s still more to it than that.</span></p> <p><span>Speaking broadly, Trump\u2019s base doesn\u2019t feel like Harvard has the answers they need. If I might hazard a suggestion, it\u2019s because Harvard has chosen to focus on the plights of minorities far more discrete and insular than the white working class. A university whose human-studies professors predominantly specialize in ethnic studies or critical legal studies (or, for that matter, in computer science or art history or financial modeling) is hardly the sort of school that is best placed to understand the rise of Donald Trump. And it\u2019s not just Harvard\u2014across the board, grant funding in sociology and anthropology is rarely going to go to somebody who wants to study the plight of the lower-middle- or working-class white American. But if you were looking for a university with the prestige and the resources to buck that trend, you\u2019d probably put your finger on a school like Harvard. The new trend might as well start with us.</span></p> <p><span>Even now we can make a difference. Harvard does have people who can shed light, little by little, on how the Trump base feels. We have economists who can talk about wage stagnation and sociologists who\u2019ve explored the soaring price of rent. We have policy experts in every field known to man. But as Colin Powell noted, coaches who have never played lack a certain credibility, and most of our professors did not come from the white working class. Even fewer have devoted their careers to studying it specifically.</span></p> <p><span>The credibility issue can\u2019t be solved overnight. (It doesn\u2019t help that New England\u2019s universities have <a href=\"http://heterodoxacademy.org/2016/07/06/the-blue-shift-of-the-new-england-professoriate/\">the most liberal faculties in the country</a> by a factor of five.) But even coaches who have never played the game can win over their players with success. We need to offer clear, coherent, and actionable answers to the problems of the white working class\u2014and so far we have failed to provide them.</span></p> <p><span>Until that happens, I leave you with the fact that the American university was not ready for Donald Trump in 2016. And I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re going to be ready for him in 2020.</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps somebody will understand why Trump voters feel the way they do, connect with them, and channel their energies into a different direction. But all the evidence suggests that the person to do this will not be found at Harvard.</span></p> <p><span><br></span></p> <p><span><em>Winston Shi is a current first-year at Harvard Law School.

{"title": "Athlete of the Week: Kathleen Young's Two Goals Leads Field Hockey to First Win Over Princeton in 22 Years | Sports | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Sean B. Chanicka", "body": "<p><span><br></span></p> <p><span>\u00adThe No. 12 Harvard field hockey team\u2019s biggest threat to winning the Ivy league this year came this past Saturday when the team traveled to New Jersey to face off with No. 10 Princeton.</span></p> <p><span>The Tigers, coming off a 5-1 win against Brown the previous weekend, came into the matchup undefeated in its four games in conference play, tied with Harvard for the top spot.</span></p> <p><span>Not only did the Tigers enter with momentum, but they were also entered with history on their side. Princeton had won the past 22 matchups between these two teams. Harvard hadn\u2019t emerged victorious over the Tigers since the first term of the Bill Clinton administration.</span></p> <p><span>The Crimson knew that someone needed to step up in a big way for the team to overcome such a challenge and stay atop the Ancient Eight standings.</span></p> <p><span>It turns out that sophomore forward Kathleen Young was that someone.</span></p> <p><span>In Harvard\u2019s 3-2 overtime victory, Young scored twice, including the crucial winner in overtime. Her efforts helped end the Crimson\u2019s 22-game losing streak against Princeton (9-6, 4-1 Ivy) as well as giving the team sole possession of first place in the Ivy League.</span></p> <p><span>With the win, Harvard (9-4, 5-0) now has its longest win streak in program history, having posted seven consecutive victories.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think she is a phenomenal athlete,\u201d Harvard coach Tjerk van Herwaarden said. \u201cHer work-rate and speed have been a huge part of our offensive prep and our pressing, which has worked really well so far. She was able to get one goal earlier this season. It matters so much more that she did it against Princeton, who is one of our rivals.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Senior Marissa Balleza opened the scoring for the Crimson the 13th minute. In the 27th minute, junior midfielder Ellie Cookson brought the ball into the circle and sent it towards the net.</span></p> <p><span>As the ball bounced around in front of the net, Young gathered it and knocked it in for the score, her second of the season. Due to Balleza and Young\u2019s efforts, Harvard went into the half with a 2-0 lead.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe team was comfortable that we could compete with Princeton,\u201d van Herwaarden said. \u201cThis team has set a goal for themselves to win the Ivy league and that\u2019s the mission and we approach it on a game by game basis. I think we started really well and took a well deserved 2-0 lead.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Despite the score at halftime, the Tigers rallied in the second half. Princeton senior attacker Cat Caro, the team\u2019s leading scorer, scored twice, in the 45th and 64th minutes, to tie the game up.</span></p> <p><span>With neither team able to score again in regulation, the game went into overtime.</span></p> <p><span>After a long 70 minutes, during which momentum swung back and forth between them, both teams headed into overtime prepared for another grueling session. However, only 59 seconds into overtime, Young received a pass just to the right of the Tiger\u2019s zone.

{"title": "Back at the Law School, Lessig Reflects on Failed Campaign | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Claire E. Parker", "body": "<p><span>Back on campus after a failed bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig said the campaign was a learning experience in the challenges affecting democracy in America.</span></p> <p><span>In particular, Lessig said restrictive changes to the Democratic National Committee\u2019s debate eligibility requirements excluded him from the stage, limiting the visibility of his electoral reform platform.</span></p> <p><span>Lessig said he  is now looking for the Republican Party to continue his proposed reforms and sees businessman Donald J. Trump as the candidate with the best chance of enacting the campaign finance reforms he ran on, given his strident criticism of Super PACs, political organizations used to funnel tens of millions of dollars into political campaigns.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI\u2019ve long thought that we will only get reform if a Republican proposes it,\u201d Lessig said.</span></p> <p><span>The center of Lessig\u2019s hope for the Republican Party is none other than Trump, a bombastic billionaire who Lessig said has created an environment where supporting Super PACs is \u201ctoxic.\u201d On the issue, Lessig said Trump can \u201ccrush\u201d rival Sen. Ted Cruz, who considers political donations free speech.</span></p> <p><span>\"As much as it\u2019s impossibly difficult for me to imagine a Donald Trump presidency.... I do kind of think that the highest probability of fundamental reform is if Donald Trump is president,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Looking beyond national politics, Lessig said his return to the Law School \u201cfeels sane.\u201d After his time spent traveling on the campaign trail, he is preparing to teach three classes this term.</span></p> <p><span>Despite the full schedule, he said he will \u201cdo as much as he can\u201d to stay involved in the upcoming election cycle but stopped short of endorsing a candidate.</span></p> <p><span>Lessig has had an active and varied academic career prior to his campaign. He is an expert in Eastern European constitutionalism, a prominent voice in the fields of internet security and copyright law, and most recently, an outspoken critic of gerrymandering and the outsized role of money in politics.</span></p> <p><span>He launched <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/9/24/lessig-2016-scrut/\">his latest project</a>\u2014a bid for the United States presidency\u2014this September after raising $1 million from small donors. He ran an unconventional single-issue platform centering on a proposed legislation titled \u201cThe Citizen Equality Act of 2017,\u201d a series of reforms to expand voting rights and limit the role of corporate political contributions. Lessig originally promised to resign after signing the legislation into law.</span></p> <p><span>However, his bid stalled out after the initial round of donations, and he failed to register enough support in polls to qualify for Democratic debates. He <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/11/3/lessig-drops-out-race/\">officially ended his campaign</a> on Nov. 2.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cTo have the appetite to join the political fray as a citizen is laudable, whatever the result,\u201d Harvard Law Professor Jonathan L. Zittrain said of his colleague\u2019s run. \u201cIt's to Harvard's credit that he had the freedom to take the leave he needed to do it, and then return to his research and teaching.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Reflecting on his campaign, Lessig said he regretted his promise to step down after completing his electoral reforms, calling the issue an \u201calbatross\u201d that distracted from the rest of his platform. Despite <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/10/19/lessig-alter-campaign-strategy/\">backtracking on that promise</a> in October, his poll numbers remained low, hovering at or below one percent.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt was a gamble, but I don\u2019t think it was a mistake to make the gamble because we got damn close,\u201d he said. \u201cI certainly wish that I\u2019d done it differently, but I don\u2019t wish that I hadn\u2019t tried.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>If the Democratic Party had not changed the criteria for its debates this year, Lessig said, he would have been able to present his platform to the nation.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think he knew this would be an upstream fight to say the least,\u201d Zittrain said, \u201cbut his instinct that this is a \u2018change\u2019 year in politics, one where people are hungry for something other than business as usual, has proved true.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>While he said he views Trump as the candidate with the best chance of carrying out fundamental campaign finance reforms, the openly liberal Lessig said he was originally a supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders before becoming concerned over the credibility of Sanders\u2019 platform.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cYou could love everything that Bernie is saying, but unless you change the political system and end this core corruption, nothing that he\u2019s talking about is even credible,\u201d Lessig said.</span></p> <p><span>He said he will continue to weigh in on the election and fight for reforms while juggling a demanding teaching schedule this spring.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI will do whatever I can, as much as I can,\u201d Lessig said.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Claire E.

{"title": "American Fascism | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>It started out as a joke. Donald Trump for president? The guy who says \u201cYou\u2019re fired\u201d and is <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/27/politics/donald-trump-hair-toupee/\">infamous</a> for his hair? Sounds like an SNL skit. After a while\u2014after it became clear that he was running to win\u2014I asked myself, \u201cIs he just trolling everyone? The Republicans? The Democrats? He can\u2019t be serious when he says these things.\u201d But say things he did, and continues to do: veterans, black people, Hispanic people, Asian people, disabled people, overweight people, Muslim people, women. Donald Trump has ridiculed and dehumanized just about every group in the country. <br></span></p> <p><span>And yet his poll numbers have continued to climb for months now, with recent numbers suggesting he is within 6 percentage points of <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_sanders-5565.html\">Bernie Sanders</a> and 3 percentage points of <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">Hillary Clinton</a>.  And all of this is done to the sound of the smug, self-satisfied laughter of our country\u2019s elite, who continue to reassure themselves, \u201cIt will never happen.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But it can happen. And the continued derision of our country\u2019s progressives, particularly amongst the crucial constituency of millennial voters, is what is allowing it to happen. Before I came to Harvard, I grew up in rural Northeast Georgia, and as a result I am acutely aware of the fundamental emotional disconnect between our country\u2019s upper tier and the average American. I realize that in an age defined by partisan newscasting, education disparities, and social media echo chambers, this country lacks mutual understanding. In the Harvard bubble, we do not truly get what causes our countrymen to speak, think, and live in the way that they do.  Because of this lack of understanding, we deride Trump as a joke, or label all Trump supporters as idiots, and, in turn, fail to recognize the legitimate concerns of America\u2019s ailing middle class, leaving our nation critically vulnerable to Trump\u2019s fascist campaign.</span></p> <p><span>Outside of Harvard, many members of America\u2019s formerly thriving middle class are furious. They are terrified.  They feel powerless in a society that was ruptured by the Recession of 2008, and in its economic reconstruction, they feel left behind. So, in looking for someone to blame, many have latched onto a figure who promises an end to the political establishment, with a campaign that harkens back to an age of national pride and, more than anything, economic security and optimism.  But what they have found is one of the greatest domestic threats to America in our nation\u2019s history.</span></p> <p><span>Something that has constantly shocked me at Harvard is just how insulated many of my classmates\u2014particularly those who are from upper class urban and suburban backgrounds\u2014were from the material and psychological impact of the Great Recession. See, my experience, like the experiences of millions of Americans from the easily derided, yet electorally crucial, \u201cfly-over\u201d regions of the U.S., was much more harrowing. I grew up in Gainesville, Georgia, a town that was ravaged by the Great Recession.</span></p> <p><span>Home foreclosure signs dotted both sides of almost every street and highway, seemingly stable jobs and lifestyles vanished, money for our textbooks evaporated, marriages shattered, children turned to drugs, and lives fell into ruin. It affected everyone in my small town in some way. Budget cuts to Georgia public education led to furlough days, inability to purchase sufficient textbooks, layoffs, hiring freezes, and classrooms stuffed to the brim with students. Small businesses shut down in droves, leaving our town square, among many other areas of the town, utterly barren.</span></p> <p><span>There is a sentiment in many of our nation\u2019s middle class households that while the rest of America was suffering, the \u201cestablishment,\u201d the political and corporate elite who arguably caused the financial crisis in the first place, avoided responsibility, either through explicitly illicit activity or through simple negligence. For many Americans, Trump, an apolitical figure, represents the strongest rejection of the \u201cestablishment,\u201d that, in their minds, ruined their livelihoods.</span></p> <p><span>I hope this article is wrong. I hope my friends and classmates are right\u2014that Trump isn\u2019t in any possible, conceivable way the threat that people seem to think that he is. After following this election closely, though, talking to friends from back home, and studying history, I am increasingly afraid of the threat that Donald Trump poses. I believe that he could win not because of his iconoclastic personality and hateful, racist rhetoric, but because citizens feel alienated from the political and economic processes of the post-Recession world, because fascism promises strength, and because people agree with Trump\u2019s lofty goal to \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In a period where everyone, especially our generation, is speaking into their own social media echo chamber, it terrifies me to think that millennials and increasingly our entire nation have been lulled into a state of apathy towards the political process. Politics matter, words matter, and hateful rhetoric to the cheer of millions matters. We must recognize where Trump\u2019s voters are coming from, understand that some of the sources of their fear and anger are legitimate, and then, with this knowledge, wake up and fight back. It is time for us, as a nation, to recognize that Trump\u2019s campaign is an affront to the idea of equality of opportunity for everyone, regardless of ethnic or religious affiliation, that we as a people are striving to obtain.</span></p> <p><span>Trump represents a false sense of security who appeals to the most instinctual feelings of fear that turn us against our neighbors because of the color of their skin or the name that they use when they talk to God. Our generation of Americans has been blessed to have never lived under a figure whose words have promised so many chilling actions of hate and intolerance.  So my message to my friends from back home in Georgia and at Harvard, is to remind ourselves that we don\u2019t have to have lived under Benito Mussolini or George Wallace to stand up united as a generation and a nation to declare, in one voice, \u201cNo.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><br></span></p> <p><span><em>William F.

{"title": "Mythologizing The Bowies  | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Years ago, I watched an interview with Robin Williams on YouTube, and wrote \u201cRobin Williams is a bag of brilliance\u201d in my journal because I was so amazed by his hilarity. I don\u2019t remember the show, the interviewer, or even what he said that was so good. All I remember is that he was mesmerizing and he gave me this incredible feeling that everything was going to be okay. His art made me feel good. It gave me a sense of freedom. <br></span></p> <p><span>With the recent tragedies regarding <a href=\"http://www.theblaze.com/contributions/looking-back-on-the-lives-and-impacts-of-david-bowie-and-glenn-frey/\">David Bowie</a>, Glenn Frey, and others, death remains a constant of the human condition. We see it over and over again on our news channels and feeds. In listening and scrolling, I\u2019ve wanted to come up with some sort of word, some sort of well-crafted phrase that makes death a little easier to swallow. I want to say that death is \u201cokay\u201d or \u201cnormal\u201d or just \u201cthe cycle of life.\u201d I want to have that \u201cokay\u201d feeling I got while watching Robin Williams.</span></p> <p><span>But the way we react to death makes it seem like it isn\u2019t okay. We don\u2019t walk into a funeral and say to those grieving \u201cWell, it\u2019s just the cycle of life\u201d or \u201cHey, don\u2019t cry, it\u2019s normal.\u201d It\u2019s true that death is probably the most normal human event, but there is something in us that says, \u201cthis is really, really bad.\u201d The right response often seems to be one of silence and sadness. It can\u2019t be sugarcoated with art or wise words.</span></p> <p><span>Robin Williams once said, \u201cIn America, they really do mythologize people when they die.\u201d This statement is hauntingly true. I mythologize him. I think he was perfect. Like we did with David Bowie and Glenn Frey, when someone dies, we have a tendency to forget his or her flaws or failures. We utilize unmitigated <a href=\"http://hollywoodlife.com/2016/01/06/jeff-daniels-jim-carrey-inside-the-actors-studio-video/\">superlatives</a>: things like \u201cHe was the most gracious person ever\u2026the best and funniest man to ever live,\u201d \u201cHe was the best songwriter,\u201d \u201cThe most wonderful musician.\u201d We memorialize these people and turn a blind eye to their faults, failures, and sins. We want to remember the good in them.</span></p> <p><span>The superlatives we know are rarely accurate. We don\u2019t have to look at a news article or delve deep into the history of their lives to know that because they were human, they screwed up. They weren\u2019t perfect because nobody is. But when they die, it\u2019s comforting to dwell on the perfect things. Remembering the dead in this unrealistic way reveals something about our relationship to death. Maybe romanticizing those we have lost is our way of recognizing how they were intended to be, how we want them to be, which is alive. We see them as perfect people and this seems help us cope with the blow of death. Like death wasn\u2019t supposed to happen to them because look how funny they were or how musical or how beautiful. Death reminds us that we each have a calling, and life has meaning.</span></p> <p><span>And so the headlines announcing the loss of a public figure make us all stop. Life means something. A couple weeks ago, we all started to mourn and mythologize David Bowie and then Glenn Frey and others who made an impact. We all posted or read the posts on our Facebooks and Instagrams. Some of us just started thinking and writing, trying to make sense of it all. Knowing that it was not okay.</span></p> <p><span>Death is a mystery and a reality. But maybe the only point in trying to understand death is to understand that this life has meaning. Some incredible human beings are no longer with us, but their lives meant something. They meant something to me and I suspect they meant something to anyone who ever engaged with their art or met them. And their lives on this earth, as everyone\u2019s life on this earth, points to something beyond, because death is not okay.</span></p> <p><span>King Solomon <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+1\">said that</a> under the sun, life is meaningless. Not that life is meaningless in and of itself, but meaningless only under the sun. I think he is saying that if life really does matter, there must be something beyond death that gives it meaning. And this is why we mythologize. This is why we make people heroes and gods when they were really just like you or me (minus a Grammy or an Oscar). Death forces us to realize the significance and beauty and preciousness of life, however flawed.</span></p> <p><span>And I know death is not a very sexy topic to discuss. Especially when Ted Cruz and Donald Trump give so much material for editorials it almost hurts. But I think it\u2019s something to think about. To really think about. It\u2019s a constant. It\u2019s the one thing we know about every human. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s okay.</span></p> <p><span>So let\u2019s go forth, friends, and live with the knowledge that every human life matters. Let us allow that knowledge to take us on a journey where we realize that maybe the brilliance of life doesn\u2019t have to be a fleeting feeling from a YouTube video. Somewhere out there, maybe we can find a forever okay.</span></p> <p><span><br></span></p> <p><span><em>Brynn A.

As the Harvard Republican Club tries to appeal to a diverse group of students who adhere to an array of conservative ideologies, Trump\u2019s rhetoric alienates other conservatives, some say.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cGenerally, the Republicans and conservatives at Harvard understand that if we truly want to appeal to the next generation, we can\u2019t be an angry, anti-immigrant, anti-religious freedom movement,\u201d said Kent K. Haeffner \u201918, treasurer of the HRC and campus leader for Harvard students for Jeb Bush.</span></p> <p><span>Four  Harvard Republicans said Trump\u2019s message, which they characterized as often racist and provocative, does not align with their mission.</span></p> <p><span>Although the Harvard Republican Club does not typically endorse a candidate during the primaries, the organization conducted a straw poll at a general meeting in November. The informal poll indicated that 48 percent of the membership supported Marco Rubio, 48 percent Jeb Bush, and four percent percent Carly Fiorina, said Aaron I. Henricks \u201916, former president of the HRC. The survey indicated no support for Trump.</span></p> <p><span>Henricks, who claims to know most public conservatives on campus, doesn\u2019t know of any Trump supporters at Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think I\u2019ve heard rumors of one existing, maybe in the far reaches of the Quad, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re serious,\u201d Henricks said.</span></p> <p><span>Other Harvard Republicans including Cameron K. Khansarinia  \u201918, a vice president of the HRC, also denied knowing a single Harvard student for Trump.</span></p> <p><span>As the National Co-chair of Students for Rubio, Khansarinia added that he is \u201cdisappointed\u201d in his party\u2019s support of Trump, arguing that his rhetoric is \u201cdivisive.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s simply not what the conservative movement or what our country stands for,\u201d Khansarinia said.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard Republicans' distrust of Trump poses a dilemma for the HRC, which Thomas said has \u201cgone all in\u201d to support the nominee of their party in the past. If Trump wins the nomination, the club will have to vote whether or not to campaign for him, Thomas said.</span></p> <p><span>Although the HRC is hopeful that Trump\u2019s pre-election polls won\u2019t equate to actual votes on election day, apprehension remains that their own party will nominate Trump.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe bubble was supposed to burst a long time ago on Trump,\u201d Thomas said.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Kabir K.

She\u2019s the missing page in a textbook filled with dead white men\u2014the closest thing to living proof that girls can win at politics, too. She\u2019s what many young women have been waiting for. So why don\u2019t we like her?</span></p> <p><span>Clinton\u2019s national lead over Bernie Sanders narrows every day, and while Clinton has stayed on top with the female demographic overall, Sanders has edged her out as frontrunner when it comes to millennials: <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/266090-sanders-winning-millennial-women-from-clinton\">Recent polls</a> have Sanders ahead among Democratic and independent women aged 18 to 34 by as many as 19 points.</span></p> <p><span>This deficit isn\u2019t new. Warning bells rang as far back as September, when the early summer\u2019s sunny numbers <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/poll-sharp-erosion-in-clinton-support-among-democratic-women/2015/09/14/6406e2a0-58c3-11e5-b8c9-944725fcd3b9_story.html\">gave way</a> to a bleaker fall forecast for Clinton. Then as now, while older women stood strong with Clinton, younger ones were slipping off to Sanders\u2019s camp. A few things might explain the gap.</span></p> <p><span>On the simplest level, Clinton seems out of touch and unrelatable. Some women say they don\u2019t see Clinton as their <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/24/us/politics/hillary-clinton-is-not-my-abuela-critics-say.html\">grandmother</a>. Others can\u2019t see her as a sister. That\u2019s understandable. Efforts at hipness from Clinton can ring as hollow as Mitt Romney standing next to a group of black people and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDwwAaVmnf4\">blurting</a>, \u201cWho let the dogs out?\u201d before woofing twice. It\u2019s a problem a gig on Saturday Night Live and a few stump speeches from <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/01/10/lena-dunham-makes-the-feminist-case-for-hillary-clinton/\">Lena Dunham</a> can\u2019t fix. But there\u2019s more to Clinton\u2019s crisis than stiffness or an age gap.</span></p> <p><span>Clinton\u2019s femaleness seems to have backfired. Instead of drawing young women closer to her, it\u2019s pushing them further and further away. It doesn\u2019t matter that Clinton is a woman. It matters that she\u2019s not our kind of woman. Millennial female voters never expected to see themselves in Sanders. Not seeing ourselves in Clinton, or Clinton in us, is so jarring precisely because we think we should.</span></p> <p><span>These past weeks, it\u2019s been easier than ever to feel jarred. No longer is it only recent missteps, like a private email server, that dog Clinton. Now, decades-old indiscretions have come back to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/21/us/politics/90s-scandals-threaten-to-erode-hillary-clintons-strength-with-women.html\">haunt</a> her as well: The scandals of the 1990s, when Bill Clinton\u2019s campaign for a second term came under threat amid multiple allegations of sexual harassment, have started to loom large over his wife\u2019s own run.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cBimbo eruptions,\u201d Clinton aide Betsey Wright famously said in response to the claims. \u201cFloozy,\u201d Bill Clinton called one of the women who spoke out. \u201cWe have to destroy her story,\u201d Hillary Clinton announced of a second. Fearful that Republicans were preparing to turn the tide against the then-president, the Clintons formed a united front.</span></p> <p><span>For many younger women, Clinton\u2019s choices in the \u201990s doom her in 2016. Certainly, the discrediting crusade she helped wage against her husband\u2019s accusers wouldn\u2019t fly in today\u2019s political climate. But for older women, it has proven easier to write Clinton\u2019s decision off as a product of the past\u2014just as it has proven easier for them to forgive Clinton for holding more conservative positions in more conservative climates.</span></p> <p><span>Different circumstances call for different decisions. Those who have lived long enough to witness society\u2019s shifts are more likely to comprehend how someone could make a decision in one era that she wouldn\u2019t make in another. It\u2019s tough for younger women, who only know today\u2019s standards, to relate.</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps older women have also discovered that sometimes life calls for, well, hard choices. Sometimes, no option falls in sync with the people we think we are, or the people we want to be. It\u2019s difficult always to make the right call over the course of three decades\u2014especially when, as in Clinton\u2019s case, every personal decision turns political and public. This is a problem younger women haven\u2019t yet had to confront and a problem they may have more trouble understanding.</span></p> <p><span>Thinking that way, it\u2019s fair to weigh more heavily what Clinton says and does now than what she said and did in the \u201990s. Because presidential candidates <a href=\"http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/january_february_2012/features/campaign_promises034471.php?page=all\">tend to</a> do in the Oval Office what they vowed to do on the campaign trail, that\u2019s not a bad tack to take.</span></p> <p><span>The notion of girl power shouldn\u2019t be enough to keep every female Democrat worshipping at the altar of Hillary. But past and personal slip-ups that don\u2019t jibe with our current conception of sisterhood shouldn\u2019t be enough to keep us away, either\u2014at least for those of us who find the candidate\u2019s policy positions up to snuff.</span></p> <p><span>As far as those positions go, Clinton has a strong record on women\u2019s rights, from equal pay to emergency contraception, and has campaigned for change in the same direction. And even aside from the feminist front, the country needs a progressive pragmatist in the White House\u2014not a mythmaker with a pipe dream for a platform. With the policy smarts to think up solutions and the political skill to push them through, Clinton is the best person for the job.</span></p> <p><span>Hillary Clinton is not our sister. She\u2019s a politician. If we get behind her, she could be a president.</span></p> <p><span><br></span></p> <p><span><em>Molly L.

{"title": "New York Values | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>In a tight race for Missouri\u2019s 6th district Congressional seat back in 2008, Representative Sam Graves launched an attack campaign against his opponent, Kansas City Mayor Kay Barnes, over her \u201cSan Francisco Values.\u201d One particularly risible <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uROhNSsi79E\">attack ad</a> featured scenes of champagne glasses clinking in the air interspersed with clips of flamboyant ethnics gyrating on each other to the beat of vaguely sexual elevator music. Graves\u2019s margin over Barnes deepened after the commercial aired, leading to a 59-37% victory. Now, eight years later, Graves\u2019s campaign manager and the mastermind behind the \u201cSan Francisco Values\u201d bit \u2014a man by the name of Jeff Roe\u2014<a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/videos/2016-01-30/cruz-campaign-manager-jeff-roe-thinks-they-ll-win-iowa\">manages</a> Ted Cruz\u2019 presidential campaign.</span></p> <p><span>But you didn\u2019t need to know all this to tell that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TM6qRl3dSME\">Cruz\u2019s \u201cNew York values\u201d jab</a> at Donald Trump two Republican debates ago was nothing more than political theater. If you can remember what seems like years ago in election time, Cruz seemed ill at ease up on stage\u2014unconvincingly making an entire city the punch line of a joke that the rest of the country was in on, then seeming too exhausted to deliver any of the million possible rebuttals against Trump\u2019s uncomfortable exploitation of 9/11. He seemed like a candidate unaware of his eventual upset Iowa victory, ready to try anything to stop the Trump machine.</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps Cruz does genuinely believe New York City is an accurate trope to highlight the most un-conservative parts of Trump\u2014his \u201csocially liberal, pro-abortion, pro-gay marriage\u201d track record and his \u201cfocus around money and the media\u201d as Cruz put it. Perhaps\u2014and most likely, I\u2019d say, considering his debate performance\u2014he doesn\u2019t. This hardly matters though, since Jeff Roe\u2019s strategy\u2014though distasteful and overblown\u2014worked well before and was <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ted-cruz-credits-attack-donald-trumps-york-values/story?id=36658796\">an important contribution</a> to his victory over Trump in last Monday\u2019s crucial battle of Iowa.</span></p> <p><span>It\u2019s worth noting first though that many of Trump\u2019s most echt-New York qualities are what drew his adherents in the first place. Conor Freidersdorf <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/01/the-new-york-values-that-donald-trump-supporters-love/424320/#article-comments\">writes</a> in <em>The Atlantic</em>, \u201cHe\u2019s big, loud, brash, unafraid to brag, and full of superlatives. He speaks his mind and has [a] high opinion of himself. He\u2019s comfortable with being pushy and with open conflict. He values ruthlessness and winners.\u201d It\u2019s this New York bravado, this cosmopolitan penchant for melodrama that holds together the Savior complex that fuels the Trump machine: From a wretched hell full of PC witch hunts and being reminded that <em>se habla espa\u00f1ol</em>, The Donald will save Iowa\u2014you know, the <em>real</em> America\u2014and make it great again.</span></p> <p><span>Cruz\u2019s response to the angst of today\u2019s middle American was far more effective, I think. Whereas Trump delivers exhausting outrage and gimmicky machismo, Cruz chose the more timeless approach of identity politics. Somewhere early on the campaign trail\u2014probably when Trump\u2019s support started to pick up\u2014the senator stunningly <a href=\"http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-03-04/ted-cruz-dumbs-himself-down\">rebranded</a> himself from the Princeton debate champion and husband of a Goldman Sachs executive to the southern evangelical who likes his beer cold and guns hot. He became a hopeless bromantic of Trump, but only incidentally\u2014as a side-effect of his focus on the culture war against moral decay and religious lethargy, a twin issue to Trump\u2019s culture war against political correctness.</span></p> <p><span>Accusing Trump of espousing New York values fits well into Cruz\u2019s general strategy, and critics were too quick to declare Trump the winner of this altercation. Branding New York as a modern American Gomorrah surely alienates urban voters, presumptuously intervenes in the fruitless search for the \u201creal America,\u201d and of course obscures the truth: That New York represents vice and excess far less compellingly than it does limitless opportunity and vibrant multiculturalism. But that\u2019s a small price to pay to exploit Trump\u2019s greatest vulnerabilities\u2014his social liberalism, his glitz, and other unforgivable red flags for the middle American voters who will likely choose the Republican nominee.</span></p> <p><span>In these weeks after Iowa, Cruz will only attempt to further undermine Trump\u2019s urban appeal, likely drawing connections between him and Hillary Clinton, a fellow denizen of New York and easy target for embodying the city\u2019s values. Trump, for what it\u2019s worth, has already done his part: In perhaps the most New York move of all time, he tweeted a threat to sue Cruz for rigging the caucuses. \u201cBad!\u201d The great American bard ends his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/694879900256354304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">tweet</a> accusing Cruz of not winning Iowa, but stealing it.</span></p> <p><span>But not even self-destructive Trump can help Cruz\u2019s cause if Cruz himself doesn\u2019t press the \u201cNew York values\u201d bit more believably and more often than he did on the debate stage two weeks ago. The Rubio supporter in me wishes he won\u2019t. But the part of me that admires Cruz\u2019s skillful ability to play the game is intrigued. In a particularly overpopulated field where candidates had to move, adapt, or die, Cruz has demonstrated a level of adaptability and a readiness to prioritize that just might take him to the White House. I would like to see that.</span></p> <p><span><em>Shubhankar Chhokra, \u201918, a Crimson editorial writer, concentrates in social studies. He lives in Eliot House.</em></span></p>"}

The data set does not include students or administrators who are not listed as teachers or researchers.</span></p> <p><span>Donations from faculty members with appointments at multiple schools at Harvard only counted toward the total of the school at which they hold  primary appointments.</span></p> <p><span>For candidate committees, contributions are limited to $2,700 a person for each of the primary and general elections. A small portion of the funds included in this analysis\u2014 less than $500\u2014are already reserved for the general election, since contributors may elect to give over $2,700 during the primary phase of an election that may only be spent if their chosen candidate receives the nomination.</span></p> <p><span>The contributions data are made public in quarterly filings to the Federal Election Commission. The figures do not include contributions made to super PACs and nonprofits groups organized under section 501(c)(4) of the tax code that engage in electioneering communications, and excludes contributions made to candidates who have since dropped out of the race.</span></p> <p><span><strong>BREAKDOWN</strong></span></p> <p><span><strong></strong>Instructors and researchers at the Business School contributed the most money to presidential candidates in 2015, donating $36,600 overall, while those with the Faculty of Arts and Sciences contributed a total of roughly $26,000, the next largest contribution total per Harvard school.</span></p> <p><span>All donations from FAS researchers and instructors went to Sanders and Clinton, as did all contributions from their peers at the Kennedy School of Government, Harvard Medical School, the Graduate School of Education, the School of Public Health, the Graduate School of Design. Former University President Lawrence H. Summers and former Kennedy School Dean Graham T. Allison both contributed the primary election limit of $2,700 to Clinton.</span></p> <p><span>Two Business School instructors contributed $5,400 to GOP candidates\u2014the highest amount of support of all of Harvard\u2019s schools. The only other Republican donor was Law School lecturer Norm Champ, who contributed to the Christie and Rubio campaigns. </span></p> <p><span>Government professor Theda R. Skocpol, who donated $650 to Clinton\u2019s campaign, said she was not surprised by faculty donations thus far.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe know that business leaders and very wealthy private fortunes tilt towards the conservative and Republican side, and we know that professors tilt towards the liberal and Democratic side\u2014that\u2019s been true for a long time,\u201d Skocpol said.</span></p> <p><span>The results mirror a similar <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/5/1/faculty-political-contributions-data-analysis/\">data analysis conducted by the Crimson</a> last spring, which found that 84 percent of contributions made by a comparable group of Harvard affiliates between 2011 and the third quarter of 2014 went to federal Democratic campaigns and political action committees. Several major donors listed during that time period, including Law School dean Martha Minow and Dunster House Master Roger B. Porter, did not make a campaign contribution last year for the 2016 presidential race.</span></p> <p><span>With many of her Harvard contributors giving the $2,700 cap, Clinton received an average donation from those individuals of about $1,263. Sanders, by contrast, received an average contribution of roughly $89.</span></p> <p><span>Skocpol noted, however, that since the contributions analyzed end last December, the data may not capture the surge of support Sanders has seen over the past month. Sanders won the New Hampshire Democratic primary by a wide margin late Tuesday evening.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThat was a period when it wasn\u2019t 100 percent clear there was going to be a huge amount of competition in the Democratic primary,\u201d Skocpol said.</span></p> <p><span><strong>POLITICS AT HARVARD</strong></span></p> <p><span>When Barack Obama <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2007/5/1/obama-seeks-professors-help-as-presidential/\">ran for his first term in 2007</a>, he turned to Harvard academics\u2014<a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2008/11/2/obamas-quiet-harvard-roots-brad-a/\">among them</a> applied economics professor David M.

By 10:30 a.m., the students hit Nashua\u2019s snow plowed streets.</span></p> <p><span>Both campaigns enlisted the support of Granite Staters using the \u201cGet Out The Vote\u201d canvassing technique, where volunteers seek out likely supporters identified through research and focus on ensuring they cast their vote on election day. Volunteers use this campaigning method near election time, when most voters have already decided on their favorite candidate.</span></p> <p><span>Susan X. Wang \u201917, President of the Harvard College Democrats and a Clinton supporter, described the process as \u201ca little less voter convincing, a little more getting people to go vote on Tuesday.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The trip, organized by the Harvard College Democrats, included members of both <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/2/1/students-man-phone-banks-for-Sanders/\">Harvard Students for Bernie</a> and Harvard Students for Hillary, eager to explain the merits of their candidates to locals.

Erney \u201919 said.</span></p> <p><span>This divide is common in New Hampshire, a swing state famous for its first-in-the-nation primary. With its independent and libertarian-leaning electorate, the state\u2019s primary comes on the heels of the <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/2/3/Iowa-caucus-reactions/\">Iowa Caucuses</a>, in which Texas Senator Ted Cruz and Clinton prevailed.</span></p> <p><span>Theda R.

Trump will win among the Republicans, and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders among the Democrats.</span></p> <p><span>The most recent <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/07/politics/new-hampshire-poll-full-results/index.html\">CNN poll</a> from New Hampshire shows Trump with 33 percent of surveyed Republican primary voters, ahead of Senators Marco A. Rubio and Ted Cruz, each of whom had 16 percent and 14 percent respectively. On the Democratic side, Sanders leads former Secretary of State Hillary R. Clinton, 58 to 35 percent.</span></p> <p><span>Sanders' grassroots support and pre-election polling numbers in New Hampshire indicate he will likely be the clear winner.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cNew Hampshire, of all the 50 states, is probably the best state in the race for Sanders,\u201d Harvard Kennedy School professor Thomas E. Patterson said.</span></p> <p><span>After his narrow loss in Iowa, Sanders needs a decisive victory in New Hampshire, because \u201cif Clinton\u2019s loss is smaller than expected, it will likely diminish his chances,\u201d Patterson said.</span></p> <p><span>This would be an important victory for the underdog from Vermont.  The most recent national <a href=\"http://www.quinnipiac.edu/images/polling/us/us02052016_Ust53w.pdf\">Quinnipiac survey</a> put the Sanders two points behind Clinton nationally with 42 percent and 44 percent of the Democratic vote respectively.</span></p> <p><span>After New Hampshire, Sanders will likely face an uphill battle. \u201cThe election calendar after New Hampshire begins to favor Clinton,\u201d Patterson said.</span></p> <p><span>For the Republicans, the New Hampshire primary serves as an opportunity to whittle down the number of candidates vying for the nomination. Kennedy School lecturer Timothy P. McCarthy \u201993  predicts that candidates will suspend their campaigns if they struggle in New Hampshire.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think if Jeb Bush, or Kasich, or Christie don\u2019t get in the top three, it\u2019s over,\u201d he said. \u201cI think New Hampshire has the potential to cut in half the Republicans that are still in the game.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Though Trump is poised to win by some distance, Rubio, the establishment candidate who McCarthy said thrived in the <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/2/3/Iowa-caucus-reactions/\">Iowa caucuses</a>, may overtake the New York businessman.</span></p> <p><span>An upset against Trump could be detrimental to his campaign. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t win in New Hampshire, that\u2019s a huge problem for him,\u201d  McCarthy said.</span></p> <p><span>Patterson, however, maintained that he felt Trump would prevail.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe question is whether Trump can translate his poll popularity to votes? It looks like he\u2019ll be able to do that in New Hampshire and that will increase his credibility as a candidate,\u201d Patterson said.</span></p> <p><span>On both sides, the New Hampshire primary plays a key role in establishing leaders from both parties and sets the tone for the primary elections and caucuses to follow.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s the first real vote test of candidacies,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cIt\u2019s a source of momentum.  If you win there, you get more media attention, you get more funds flowing into your campaign, and you can carry that into subsequent states.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>While the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary are important in their signalling effect to candidates, it is dangerous to allow the results to over-inform the voting choices of Americans more broadly, McCarthy said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think that as the country moves to a majority of color-people country in the next generation, Iowa and New Hampshire will remain even more disproportionately white and that becomes even more of a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cThe weight of those victories gets undue power in the way the election gets spun.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><em>This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: </em></span></p> <p><span><strong>CORRECTION: Feb. 10, 2016</strong></span></p> <p><span>An earlier version of this article misstated the class year of lecturer Timothy P.

{"title": "Questions of Travel | Magazine | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>I was told on the first day of a writing workshop that only two narrative structures exist in the entire history of plot: 1) a hero goes on a journey, and 2) a stranger comes to town. As useful as this maxim is in plotting the beats of a screenplay, the question of perspective puzzles me in parsing the tangled strands of my own journeys. A real-life wanderer lives any story as its hero\u2014when we travel, we do things. Things happen to us. It\u2019s difficult to escape this self-centered narrative, or view oneself as a stranger, particularly when trying to really see a place. It\u2019s even more difficult to escape later on, in the telling of that place.</span></p> <p><span>Traveling to India for the first time, on a loosely defined fellowship with little-to-no preconceived narrative structure (despite its funding by the English department), I wanted to shed the heroic-journey paradigm, to impartially absorb a new and entirely different place. But certain stories and images of India had been provided for me as a 23-year-old American woman. Would it be \u201cEat, Pray, Love\u201d or \u201cA Passage to India?\u201d I pictured the Beatles: shaggy-haired, unshaven, posing with a sitar, or the even more fully bearded Allen Ginsberg transcribing visions in his Indian Journals. Then, there\u2019s \u201cSlumdog Millionaire.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Practically as soon as I cleared my Dubai layover and landed in Kolkata, the Facebook messages started arriving: \u201cOMG how is India? Can\u2019t wait to hear everything!\u201d and I began to think of my experiences in terms of how I would tell them. I became aware of how difficult this would be on the first day, wandering through my neighborhood. The stray dogs and decapitated chickens bleeding into the street didn\u2019t seem part of the same story as the terrifying chaos of traffic, or the mysterious rhythms of the university my travel partner and I were visiting. Nothing paused to cohere into a story we could tell: It just was. We were strangers come to town, but there was nothing remarkable about that.</span></p> <p><span>Stories to write home aside, constructing narratives about the trip for ourselves was a difficult project. Most signifiers had been robbed of their expected meanings\u2014water was danger; our iPhones functioned only as malaria pill alarm clocks. The atmosphere was subsumed by smog into a kind of hazy non-weather, detached, in the mild Bengali winter, from ideas of hot or cold. The usual criteria for evaluating situations did not apply\u2014I had lost the ability to measure safety, feasibility, or even distance (and the ability to Google it), and operated largely on best guesses, vague guidebook advice, and the hospitality of Kolkatans who were always happy to give directions to two lost American girls. Often, crowds would form in the street to collaborate on the project of calling us an Uber, or arguing over the best route to the restaurant we were looking for. In a class at the university\u2014Postcolonial Literature\u2014I was surprised to find my own continent the subject of study. Everything was flipped; the distant and exotic Americas, ravaged by European imperialism. Places I had never felt close to\u2014the waters of the Caribbean and ancestral Inca stomping grounds\u2014suddenly felt like part of my own history.</span></p> <p><span>At a Kolkata literary festival one weekend, held at the colonial-stamped locations of the Oxford Bookstore and the Victoria Memorial, we found keys to the collective narratives we needed to tap into\u2014a little less \u201chero\u2019s journey,\u201d a little more \u201cstranger comes to town.\u201d Certain stories came up at every panel we attended, whether about book publishing and book covers, Southeast Asian writing, or the literature of trauma, the bloody 1971 partition of Pakistan and Bangladesh. On another weekend trip to Varanasi, the holy city, we puzzled over religious inscriptions on temples.</span></p> <p><span>Sitting in a professor\u2019s apartment over takeout Chinese and rum with flat, syrupy Coke, we told each other stories. Sometimes we stumbled, conversations stalled by the insurmountable obstacle of scale. Our hosts reached the end of a long answer to one of many questions only to sigh, visibly grappling with the counter examples. What role did caste play in contemporary India? Though everyone in the room claimed that it wasn\u2019t relevant, they could read each other\u2019s castes in their last names. Several students teased their Brahmin friend and he described half-heartedly participating in his family\u2019s coming-of-age ritual, wearing a string around his neck and spending a solitary day or two in prayer. His younger brother had bought a cow with his coming-of-age money. Elsewhere, caste really did dictate everything from profession, to income level, to marriage, to place of residence. Embedded in a liberal, privileged university community, our companions couldn\u2019t represent India to us. Likewise, we couldn\u2019t represent America. We don\u2019t like Donald Trump, we insisted.</span></p> <p><span>In Darjeeling, we encountered tourists of all kinds: fashionable Nepali teenage girls who wanted a photo with us, American backpackers flocking to WiFi in an alarmingly Brooklyn-style caf\u00e9, Indians from around the northeast. We wanted to hear about local culture\u2014the Tibetan influence, the tourism industry, the continued existence of colonial-era continental restaurants and resorts\u2014but our Buddhist homestay host turned instead to theories about the connection between ISIS and Angela Merkel as we huddled around his space heater.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe government created ISIS, and now they won\u2019t take in any refugees,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s all there online, but the media isn\u2019t reporting it.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>He offered us black tea, wondering if, as American coffee-drinkers, it might be unfamiliar. When we demurred because of the late hour, he insisted that the idea that tea contained caffeine was a myth, and also warned us against the ubiquitous chai we consumed by the miniature, ceramic cupful. Milky, full of sugar and cardamom, this seemingly national drink of India, he claimed, was in fact a chemical byproduct posing as tea.</span></p> <p><span>Towards the end of the trip, exhausted and fed up with processing the raw information of our experience, we turned back to familiar narratives of India. We hijacked university Internet, surreptitiously torrenting Wes Anderson movies with palpable shame. It wasn\u2019t just that we missed American culture; we wanted to see American narratives of India, specifically to be told how to think about the place we were in. We watched \u201cThe Darjeeling Limited,\u201d \u201cBend It Like Beckham,\u201d and, abandoning all pretense of decency, \u201cSlumdog Millionaire.\u201d I felt dirty, voyeuristic. It was as grotesque to me as it had seemed the first time I saw it in theaters, profiting on poverty and violence, spinning a happy ending with a Bollywood-esque dance number. But, although I recognized some of its imagery after three weeks in India, I had no better read on how realistic its depictions were, or how reasonable or acceptable a story it made. Of course, the movie doesn\u2019t describe what India is like\u2014as a quintessential hero\u2019s journey, \u201cSlumdog Millionaire\u201d is about what happens to Jamal. Perhaps frustratingly, but still necessarily, my stories from India are about what happened to me there, and nothing else. In both seeking and resisting narrative, my stories of the trip have probably morphed by now into a mix of inherited images, retrospectively romanticized adventures, and a jumble of sensations and strange details. Several weeks out, the photos and the souvenirs have already taken on meanings they never really had: things chosen randomly and opportunistically, and now forced to contain the entirety of the trip. When asked how my trip to India was, I\u2019ve settled on the non-answer, \u201cintense.\u201d</span></p>"}

Cotton \u201999, Republican U.S. Senator from Arkansas and a Law School alumnus, may have begun to look towards the 2020 election.</span></p> <p><span>Cotton, 39, recently traveled to Iowa for four days of campaign stops, concluding his visit by delivering the keynote speech at Scott County\u2019s Republican dinner\u2014a meal that Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence also attended. Cotton\u2019s travels prompted the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, and The Economist to publish articles speculating on the senator\u2019s presidential ambitions.</span></p> <p><span>Cotton's staff did not respond to request for comment.</span></p> <p><span>Government and sociology professor Theda R. Skocpol said she also thinks Cotton is eyeing the 2020 race.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think he\u2019s to be taken very seriously,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s already in Iowa, he\u2019s laying the basis for capturing an aggressive stance on foreign policy and the following of Donald Trump in this election, but doing so in a way that will be more disciplined than [Trump].\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t say things to alienate women, for example,\u201d Skocpol added, referring to the Republican presidential nominee\u2019s lewd comments about women in a tape first reported by the Washington Post. She also said Cotton is \u201cmore in control of his personal emotions\u201d than Trump, who is known for firing insults at political opponents and detractors over Twitter.</span></p> <p><span>Government professor Harvey C. Mansfield \u201953 largely agreed with Skocpol, deeming it \u201cunsurprising\u201d that Cotton would seek the presidency or that other people would consider him a contender for the role.</span></p> <p><span>Mansfield, who has been at Harvard <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/3/1/harvey-mansfield-scrutiny-FM/\">for nearly five decades</a>, said he taught Cotton as an undergraduate in \u201ca couple of courses\u201d and was \u201cquite close\u201d to him, even reading Cotton\u2019s senior thesis. Though Mansfield could not recall the topic of Cotton\u2019s paper, he said he well remembers Cotton\u2019s propensities as a student.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe\u2019s very tall and he sat in the front row, so you couldn\u2019t miss him,\u201d Mansfield said. Cotton is six foot four. \u201cHe leaned forward, he had a very intent expression, watching, and he liked to talk, to raise a question. Not the simple question but the pressing, probing [one].\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe [also] came to office hours, not everybody does that,\u201d Mansfield added.</span></p> <p><span>If Trump loses to Democratic nominee Hillary R. Clinton on Nov. 8, enabling Cotton to launch a presidential bid in 2020, the senator\u2019s chances of success are far from clear, according to political experts.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cCotton has been mentioned on the potential \u2018wannabe\u2019 list for 2020, but that assumes that Trump loses and assumes lots of other things, which are right now not really calculable,\u201d Lee M. Miringoff, the director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, said. \u201cBecause, if Trump doesn\u2019t win, it\u2019s really cloudy to figure out where the GOP is going to go. I mean, where does the party pick up the pieces after this really fractured time for them?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Kyle D. Kondik, a political analyst at the University of Virginia, agreed with Miringoff. Kondik noted that although Cotton has the \u201cright profile\u201d for Republican primaries, given his conservative views and his \u201chawkish\u201d attitude towards foreign policy, the senator\u2019s likelihood of winning the nomination is dependent on \u201cwhere the party may want to go in 2020.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Mansfield said he thought the current \u201csplit\u201d in the Republican party might benefit Cotton as \u201csomeone new who hasn\u2019t been on the scene before.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe\u2019s quite young, maybe too young,\u201d Mansfield said. \u201cOn the other hand, an early try at [the presidency] might still be to his advantage.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>While an undergraduate at Harvard, Cotton wrote for The Crimson\u2019s Editorial Board, penning a 1996 article about another tall, ambitious politician from Arkansas: Bill Clinton.

{"title": "Letter to the Editor: American Dream, American Nightmare | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>To the editor:</span></p> <p><span>Millions of Americans, including many in my hometown, will vote for Donald J. Trump in November. Several million will do so because they believe Trump has the answers to their material problems, and because they have valid grievances with the American political system. Regardless of whether those reasons are based in reality, I consider it unfair to condemn all Trump supporters to the so-called basket of deplorables. However, I do consider it fair to condemn certain justifications for supporting Donald Trump. Namely, I write to condemn wholeheartedly a reason put forward in the recently published <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/10/4/cullen-defense-donald-trump/\">op-ed</a>, \"In Defense of Donald Trump.\" The author of this article claims that Trump \"actively gathers support by reawakening a sense of pride in the identity each of us has as an American,\" and that Trump's policies \"strike a deep and patriotic chord with their connotation of national strength.\" Most troublingly, the author suggests that Trump's campaign \"does not signify a lack of compassion for foreigners,\" but rather fights to prevent a \"socialistic infringement on the American Dream.\"</span></p> <p><span>To the author of this article, and to those who agree with it, I pose one simple question: where do you find the audacity to dream on behalf of your compatriots?</span></p> <p><span>The author invokes the founding myth when defining such malleable topics as national identity, patriotism, and the American Dream. But the American Dream is intentionally difficult to define because it is a set of aspirations that vary from person to person. Propped up by a near-irrelevant Patrick Henry quote, the author stains the myth of the American Dream with toxic notions of white nationalism and global domination. By arguing that Donald Trump inspires patriotism and pride in American identity, the author implies that Trump's dissenters are un-American. Their national pride is invalid, and they don't want America to be \"great.\" Further, the author implicitly links American nationalism to white nationalism, and therefore to the ideology of white supremacy. The author brushes aside Trump's xenophobia, which is dwarfed by the greater goal of making America \"great.\" Minorities and dissenters are not enemies to be vanquished on the path to everlasting glory; they are key to our national identity.</span></p> <p><span>As long as we share an American mythos, it must be used for good. I caution Trump apologists against venturing down the well-trodden and dark path of fervent nationalism. As current struggles for civil rights demonstrate, our history trails only so far behind us. We must recognize and indeed treasure the idea that not all Americans want the same thing for their country and for their life. We must recognize that these myths are malleable for a reason: they can be and have been summoned in support of unjustified wars, imperialistic geopolitical schemes, and violence against minorities here at home.</span></p> <p><span>And above all, we must recognize that one person's American Dream is another's waking nightmare.</span></p> <p><span><br></span></p> <p><span><em>Daniel J.

Truman, found himself at the helm of a nation recovering from war and the most gripping economic depression in American history.</span></p> <p><span>The day after he was sworn in as our nation\u2019s 33rd president, Truman famously <a href=\"https://www.trumanlibrary.org/lifetimes/whouse.htm\">remarked</a> to reporters on Capitol Hill: \u201cBoys, if you ever pray, pray for me now. I don't know if you fellows ever had a load of hay fall on you, but when they told me yesterday what had happened, I felt like the moon, the stars, and all the planets had fallen on me.\"</span></p> <p><span>Truman was at that point only 82 days into his vice presidency, and needless to say, he felt daunted by the task ahead of him. He wasn\u2019t totally unprepared\u2014Truman had a <a href=\"https://www.trumanlibrary.org/hst-bio.htm\">history</a> of service in the Missouri National Guard and had fought in World War I. He presided as a local county judge and served a decade in the U.S. Senate. By many accounts, he had earned a reputation of honesty and integrity and was <a href=\"http://teachingamericanhistory.org/webinars-page/2004-hamby/\">praised</a> as being a \u201cman of the people.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>As president, his experience and preparation were crucial. In the first four months of his presidency, Harry Truman negotiated the end of the war in Europe, led the Potsdam Conference to determine Germany\u2019s future, and made the grueling decision to detonate two atomic bombs over Japan.</span></p> <p><span>The deployment of the world\u2019s first atomic bomb in Hiroshima and the subsequent bombing in Nagasaki <a href=\"http://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii/bombing-of-hiroshima-and-nagasaki\">killed</a> more than 120,000 Japanese citizens instantly, and tens of thousands more were gravely injured from radiation. Truman made the decision, the most difficult of his life, to save hundreds of thousands of American lives and finally halt the Second World War.<br></span></p> <p><span>After the war, in 1960, Japan and the United States signed a <a href=\"http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/n-america/us/q&amp;a/ref/1.html\">mutual cooperation treaty</a>. The Japanese constitution, written during the U.S. occupation, <a href=\"http://time.com/2946076/japan-ends-ban-on-military-self-defense/\">precludes</a> the country from maintaining a military, so U.S. bases are responsible for the country\u2019s defense. Today, Japan pays over $4 billion towards America's military presence in the country, and the alliance is a linchpin for the U.S. defense strategy in East Asia.</span></p> <p><span>At the Presidential Debate last Monday, the Republican nominee for president boldly <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/09/26/495115346/fact-check-first-presidential-debate\">declared</a>, \u201cThey [the countries we defend] do not pay us what they should be paying us because we are providing tremendous service and we\u2019re losing a fortune,\u201d and \u201cthat's why we\u2019re losing, we\u2019re losing, we lose on everything.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Answering a question by the moderator about his stance on our country\u2019s  policy on first use, Trump\u2019s answer devolved into incoherent criticisms of China and the Iran Nuclear Deal. He denounced our decades-old alliances with countries like Japan and the Republic of Korea, a bulwark against growing Chinese influence, while also criticizing the president and the State Department for not doing enough to combat rising Chinese economic and military power.</span></p> <p><span>Last Monday, Donald Trump failed to demonstrate even a modicum of understanding of foreign policy. And most frustratingly, he appeared to give no thought to the consequences of his statements.</span></p> <p><span>It was abundantly clear that Donald Trump did not <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/24/us/politics/presidential-debate-hillary-clinton-donald-trump.html?_r=0\">invest</a> a single ounce of energy into preparing substantively for the first debate, nor has he invested any energy into preparing for the responsibilities of being president. Trump\u2019s visionary foreign policy agenda is to build a wall and negotiate better deals\u2014whatever that means\u2014while backing down on support for our allies and receding further into American isolationism. His flippant threats about the use of force are unsettling, from his intention to \u201cbomb the <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2015/11/13/trumps_updated_isis_plan_bomb_the_shit_out_of_them_send_exxon_in_to_rebuild.html\">shit</a>\" out of ISIS to his threat to shoot Iranian <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/09/09/trump_if_iran_harasses_us_ships_they_will_be_shot_out_of_the_water.html\">ships</a> out of the water. His <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/29/us/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-intelligence-briefings.html?_r=1\">comment</a> about knowing \u201cmore about ISIS than the generals do\u201d illustrates both an incredible lack of respect for the U.S. military and an unacceptable arrogance about the complexities of armed conflict.</span></p> <p><span>And at one point in the debate Trump <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNZenoPC3Hs\">yelled</a> about having a good temperament.</span></p> <p><span>As a leader like Harry Truman showed us, no one is ever truly prepared to be president. But they can try. Behind every decision to act to save an American\u2019s life, soldier or citizen, is a series of trade-offs and consequences we have to accept. Our commander in chief should approach the job with thoughtfulness and appreciation for the complexities that make governing and international diplomacy so challenging. He or she should understand that when it comes to nuclear warfare, our whole planet is at stake.</span></p> <p><span>Our country\u2019s next leader will face their share of trials; from coping with international terrorism and trying to heal painful racial divides to helping our nation compete in a global economy.</span></p> <p><span>Donald Trump is not a \u201cman of the people.\u201d He is not prepared to be president, nor, in my opinion, does he have what it takes to be the leader our country deserves.</span></p> <p><span><br></span></p> <p><span><em>Caroline M.

Clinton, and 26 percent said they would back other candidates.</span></p> <p><span>Overall, a plurality, or 36 percent of respondents, said they supported Johnson.</span></p> <p><span>Earlier this summer, the Republican Club denounced Trump in a <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/8/5/republican-club-not-support-trump/\">scathing statement</a>, citing \u201cboth policy and temperamental concerns\u201d about the Republican standard-bearer. The decision is the first time that the club\u2013the oldest college Republican chapter in the country\u2013declined to endorse their party\u2019s presidential nominee since the group\u2019s founding in 1888.</span></p> <p><span>Kiera O\u2019Brien \u201920, a Republican Club member who supports Johnson, wrote in an email that she did not believe either major party candidate represented her political values.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI originally supported Rubio, and now I find myself unable to get behind Trump, similar to many other members of the Harvard Republican Club,\u201d she wrote.</span></p> <p><span>She added, \u201cFor me, voting for Johnson is a not a wasted vote, since\u2026 I believe [it] sends a message that many of us are unhappy with the major party candidates on the ballot.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But not all club members believe Johnson is the appropriate conservative alternative to Trump.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAs far as protest votes go, Johnson is a pretty poor vehicle because he would not make for a particularly good president,\u201d John S.

{"title": "In Defense of Donald Trump | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Along with my fellow board members of the Harvard Republican Club, I long wrestled with the prospect of Donald Trump receiving the nomination and potentially winning the presidency. The club\u2019s decision not to endorse him stems from a party-wide hope to regroup and retake the Oval Office in four years\u2019 time, under the pretense that Republicanism would be damaged by a Trump administration. But it is my contention that Donald Trump possesses presidential attributes and ideals that appeal not only to Republicans, but also to everyone honored to dwell in this country.</span></p> <p><span>In 1775, Founding Father Patrick Henry <a href=\"https://www.history.org/almanack/life/politics/giveme.cfm\">declared</a>, \u201cThere is a just God who presides over the destinies of nations; and who will raise up friends to fight our battles for us. The battle, sir, is not to the strong alone; it is to the vigilant, the active, the brave.\u201d Trump actively gathers support by reawakening a sense of pride in the identity each of us has as an American. Firm and bold promises regarding border security, military prestige, financial supremacy, and the preservation of capitalism strike a deep and patriotic chord with their connotation of national strength. Trump\u2019s advocacy for American greatness does not signify a lack of compassion for foreigners, but rather is a reply to an erosion of our foundations, embodied by tendencies toward entangling political correctness, dangerous diplomacy, and socialistic infringement on the American Dream. His condemnation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s wish to impose more taxes on the wealthy while reducing the incentive for welfare recipients to rise above unemployment stems from trust in the aptitude and desire of all Americans to diligently meet the needs of themselves and those dependent upon them.</span></p> <p><span>As a Christian and a conservative, I am not alone in questioning Trump\u2019s views on certain social matters, but I am confident that he will not allow a reckless desire for change\u2014or a selfish mission to preserve his image\u2014to bypass due process or to silence members of either party. I admire his faith in citizens\u2019 capacity to wield the Second Amendment in an empowering manner. I echo his message of entrepreneurship applied toward providing for oneself and one\u2019s family. And I commend his efforts to engage with the underrepresented\u2014note his frustration at a rally in Colorado, when event coordinators, to avoid a fire hazard, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/01/politics/donald-trump-fire-marshals-crowd-size/\">denied</a> admission to many supporters. He is repelled by the prospect of leaving any listeners on the outside looking in.</span></p> <p><span>Some are quick to mention Trump\u2019s fluctuating stances. For instance, a segment in the recent debate dealt with whether he had initially opposed the Iraq war. Through allegations and controversy, his campaign has unwaveringly demonstrated support for our military, confirming his steadfast loyalty to those like my father who have served and continue to serve our nation. In hindsight it is easy to deem past decisions regrettable, but it is unfair to criticize them solely on this premise, and instead we must focus on using the wisdom that history offers for the present. In further response to critics, contemplate the hypocrisy of <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/clinton-releases-first-general-election-ad-against-trump-n590441\">current Clinton ads</a>, which speak of her desire to give \u201cevery man, woman, and child the chance to live up to their God-given potential,\u201d despite her readiness to dismiss the unfulfilled potential of the unborn, evidenced by <a href=\"http://www.ontheissues.org/2016/Hillary_Clinton_Abortion.htm\">unprecedented proposals</a> for abortion.</span></p> <p><span>It\u2019s true that Trump lacks political experience, but one individual\u2019s shortage of experience has rarely doomed any endeavor. Consider President Eisenhower, who with a non-political background settled the Suez Canal crisis, signed the 1957 Civil Rights Act, and established the Interstate Highway System. Hope unfailingly rests on appointing seasoned advisors, and in turn to wisely weigh their counsel. It is chosen individuals such as Governor Pence\u2014those undeniably informed in the political sphere\u2014who will sharpen Trump\u2019s understanding.</span></p> <p><span>Weeks ago, Trump\u2019s rhetoric involved Clinton\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/06/us/politics/hillary-clinton-fbi-email-comey.html?_r=0\">escape from federal prosecution</a> in the wake of her email scandal, generating legitimate concern about the Democrats\u2019 integrity in upholding Constitutionality equally in all cases. Later, he focused on the Democratic Party\u2019s ineffectiveness in combating racial tensions despite an ever-increasing influx of funding in intercity communities. He has noted Clinton\u2019s lack of vigilance, as witnessed by her role in the overly concessive nuclear deal with Iran, whose leader has openly spoken for \u201cdeath to America\u201d\u2014in fact, <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-signed-secret-document-to-lift-u-n-sanctions-on-iranian-banks-1475193723\">sanctions were lifted prematurely</a> last week from two Iranian banks that had supported Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program. In what he has said and written, his attacks have centered on Clinton\u2019s tangible failure (or on matters that would induce failure). Moreover, though she is not to be blamed for shortfalls of President Obama\u2019s domestic policy, the role of any new candidate is to put forth solutions to problems left by his or her predecessor. With Clinton, we instead see a disappointing absence of ideas to remedy the more than $19 trillion national debt and to alleviate racial unrest, and a refusal to recognize the downfalls of the Affordable Health Care Act.</span></p> <p><span>In a scenario where the vote will most pivotally shape our course, I urge all who will listen not to dismiss their qualms about Donald Trump, but foremost to genuinely consider his merits and the capacity he has to admirably serve the United States.</span></p> <p><span><em><br></em></span></p> <p><span><em>Alexander J.

Finding its roots in what liberals like Dave Rubin have taken to calling the regressive left, the new creed has but one law: \u201cTo disagree is to be deplorable.\u201d Deviance <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/29/opinion/sunday/the-liberal-blind-spot.html\">not tolerated</a>.<br></span></p> <p><span>The rise of Donald Trump\u2014a lying, amoral, corrupt, racist-pandering charlatan who is not qualified to lead his local kindergarten\u2019s bake sale\u2014is often cited as evidence of the veracity of the creed. But the rise of Trump is not so much indicative of the bigotry of the Republican electorate as it is of the age-tested truism that dogma breeds unthinking resistance.</span></p> <p><span>Recently\u2014since around the turn of the century\u2014the left\u2019s prohibition on dissent has come to dominate their thinking. The pervasiveness of the creed is felt perhaps most sharply on college campuses, where adherence to the new law is <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/author/katherine-timpf\">well-documented</a> and has recently <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/liberal-but-not-tolerant-on-the-nations-college-campuses/2016/02/11/0f79e8e8-d101-11e5-88cd-753e80cd29ad_story.html?utm_term=.4ac6d075c2bb\">expressed itself in ugly and destructive ways</a>. Conservative media outlets are dominated by examples, new ones appearing almost daily, of figures on campus or in the media smugly dismissing those who disagree with them as racist for everything from <a href=\"http://humanevents.com/2013/06/05/msnbcs-bashir-irs-is-the-new-n-word/\">criticizing the IRS</a> to <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2055158/Herman-Cain-seen-GOP-Black-man-knows-place-says-Karen-Finney.html\">voting for black politicians</a>. Political differences are understandable, and the hackneyed counsel to \u201chit your opponent where it hurts\u201d is as much a part of the day to day trudge through the trenches of modern American politics as anything else. But for too long, the left has rejected the idea that <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/jonathan_haidt_on_the_moral_mind?language=en\">two moral human beings can come to different conclusions</a> on a variety of issues.</span></p> <p><span>By emphasizing the impossibility of benign dissent, Democrats have won elections. But liberal alarmism on issues of identity has always been a shortsighted goal\u2014as in the case of the boy who cried wolf, the village folk will only believe the hysterics for so long.</span></p> <p><span>In direct response to years of these vapid accusations and (often feigned) outrage, it has become dogma on the right that the when the left cries \u201cbigot!\u201d the proper reaction\u2014always\u2014is a disappointed shake of the head and a downward smirk. Thus, alarmism on the left has bred ossification and codified unbelief on the right. Effective communication between the sides was severed. Everyone on the right who opposed Donald Trump on moral grounds was immediately declared to be Of The Left, a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/25/politics/alt-right-explained-hillary-clinton-donald-trump/\">cuck</a>\u201d and a traitor who wished to see Hillary Clinton elected. We destroyed our ability to defend against the wolves, and perhaps we deserve to pay the price. In any case, our wolf has arrived.</span></p> <p><span>Donald Trump <em>is</em> a bigot. Many of his comments about women are <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/women-you-have-to-treat-them-like-shit-new-ad-highlights-trumps-statements-on-women\">horrible</a>. Democratic politicians correctly argue that they have been pointing this out for months, and that they therefore cannot possibly bear blame for his ascension. But they have made the same accusations about <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xxUxO820PE\">Mitt Romney</a>, <a href=\"http://www.capitolhillblue.com/node/10086\">John McCain</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXyryUHItuc\">George W. Bush</a>, and likely most every Republican politician of whom you have ever heard. These accusations all looked shallow, desperate, and outright false to most conservative Americans. With this precedent set, why should the average Republican voter treat the allegations against Trump any differently?</span></p> <p><span>The problem is that a broken clock is right twice a day.</span></p> <p><span>The left has been crying Trump for a generation. Millennial conservatives have never known anything other than a left more trigger-happy than the NRA\u2014a left ever-ready to thoughtlessly dismiss people about whom coastal elites have little genuine understanding as <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/ben-smith/2008/04/obama-on-small-town-pa-clinging-to-religion-guns-xenophobia-007737\">bitter clingers</a> or <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/09/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-basket-of-deplorables/\">deplorables</a>.</span></p> <p><span>The left has in this way lost the ability to effectively call out bigotry of any sort. Because of the standards developed over the years, accusations of Republican bigotry must always operate one level higher than the truth: Mitt Romney, instead of having a different worldview to be evaluated on its merits, is a racist\u2014and if Mitt et al. are racists, then Donald Trump can\u2019t just be a racist\u2014his bigotry must be elevated to a nearly <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/08/7_times_donald_trump_has_been_compared_to_hitler.html\">Hitlerian</a> magnitude.</span></p> <p><span>We are creating a dangerous self-perpetuating cycle. The more accusations are stretched, the less credible they will become, and the more likely it is that the right will refuse to acknowledge any form of bigotry, regardless of blatancy. Conservatives have thus been forced into a very difficult position in this election. Either they grudgingly embrace The Donald\u2014and overtly do what they have always been accused of doing covertly: spending their moral capital on a politician who <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-keeps-up-attacks-on-judge-gonzalo-curiel-1464911442\">flirts with racism</a>\u2014or they disavow Trump, thereby granting a patina of credibility to a leftist worldview that will in the future be used to smear them, attacking them as merely less raucous, more tactful incarnations of the Trumpian worldview. Conservatives should know that the \u201cStrange New Respect\u201d given to them by the left for opposing Trump is merely loaned, and as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/douthatnyt/status/778659029480513541\">Ross Douthat learned</a> in the aftermath of his recent <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/21/opinion/campaign-stops/clintons-samantha-bee-problem.html?_r=0\">column on Samantha Bee</a>, easily revoked.</span></p> <p><span>Of course, the right also bears blame for the ascension and normalization of a detestable man. \u201cWhoever fights with monsters,\u201d Nietzsche <a href=\"http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/f/friedrichn124387.html\">said</a>, \u201cshould look to it that he himself does not become a monster.\u201d As the right battled in vain to deflect superfluous allegations of racism, they became lax and reactionary, and, finally, the Nietzschean abyss gazed back into them, releasing Donald Trump from its hellish maw.</span></p> <p><span>The fault borne by the right for the rise of Trump is already clear to us, though, having been shouted from the rooftops by everyone left of Reagan. But what perhaps is still murky is the fact that, in searching for the Dr. Frankenstein to blame for the Trumpian beast, the left ought to gaze\u2014for a moment\u2014into the mirror.</span></p> <p><span><br></span></p> <p><span><em>Jack McIntire '20, a Crimson editorial comper, lives in Matthews Hall.</em><br></span></p>"}

{"title": "Donald Trump Must Renounce Hatred  | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>This past Sunday, some Harvard undergraduates received an unpleasant surprise in their inboxes: <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/10/4/white-supremacy-email-circulates-college/\">an email</a> from the white supremacist hate group \u201cEducators and Students Against White Genocide.\u201d The message\u2014with the subject heading \u201cFight White Genocide - Vote Trump!\u201d\u2014was as deluded as the name of the organization that sent it would suggest. In brief, it argued that \u201c\u2018diversity\u2019 means chasing down the last white.\u2019\u201d</span></p> <p><span>No one has yet invented language strong enough to condemn such bizarre and dangerous ideas. The intrusion of this odious racism and hatred into the Harvard community is of course unfortunate, but what is more unfortunate is that such rhetoric has been on the rise in parts of the country we too often dismiss as not relevant to our own lives. This email underscores just how alarmed we should be that views like these still find any significant audience anywhere in the United States, or indeed anywhere in the world.</span></p> <p><span>While it goes without saying that this email\u2019s contents are a reflection of a twisted worldview, we wish to highlight one of its assumptions that deserves particularly fierce rebuttal: the idea that the United States is a country for white people. Besides its failure to acknowledge that powerful Native American civilizations peopled this continent long before Europeans set foot on its shores, this view also fails to acknowledge the African-Americans, Hispanics, Asians, and countless others who have built this country and who, in many cases, have been here just as long as Americans of European descent, if not longer. To erase them from the nation\u2019s history is historical malpractice of the highest order.</span></p> <p><span>But to address the contents of this email in the terms of traditional historical analysis or discourse is nearly laughable. This email glorifies the most disgusting and shameful parts of our country\u2019s history. There is no reason for them to return from the depths of the past.</span></p> <p><span>Of the email\u2019s many disturbing qualities, however, by far the most worrying is its invocation of a major party\u2019s presidential candidate to render racist views mainstream. Rhetoric like this is not only wrong on its face; it is also a threat to the foundational ideas that have animated this nation\u2019s history, to the future of a republic whose constant pursuit of a more perfect union has inspired people around the world, and to an increasingly diverse nation that has always struggled to find strength in difference. It has no place in a race for leader of the free world.</span></p> <p><span>All candidates should renounce any groups that hold that Americans of non-European descent have less of a right to this country than their fellow citizens, and any campaign should find it disturbing that avowed white supremacists consider its rhetoric encouraging. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton has already made it abundantly clear that she unequivocally disavows this sort of hateful rhetoric. We call on Donald Trump to do the same.</span></p>"}

We would have the best of the Republican Party and the best of the Democratic Party in our administration,\u201d he said. \u201cCut taxes, reduce government spending, and reduce the deficit. That\u2019s our plan.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The speech was followed by a question and answer session, where Weld faced some friendly fire over a gaffe from his running mate.

Garvey \u201917 said he was excited to host Weld, especially with many Republican Club members looking for alternative candidates to support this cycle.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe\u2019re exploring our different options,\u201d Garvey said. \u201cWe\u2019re bringing him here because he was a very successful Republican governor of Massachusetts.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>However, Weld\u2019s visit was not all political. For a while, he talked about his own memories from his time <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/5/23/William-Weld-Profile/\">as an undergraduate</a> at Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI used to have a lot of classes in Emerson and Sever and I used to take a nap at 1:40. I had a 2:00 class. Harvard time\u2026that\u2019s a really good thing,\u201d Weld said, referring to the classroom buildings in Harvard Yard and the fact that Harvard classes typically start seven minutes after their scheduled time.</span></p> <p><span>The roughly 75-member audience greeted Weld with applause and laughter on multiple occasions, sometimes cheering at his proposals. Many stopped to take pictures with him and ask him additional policy questions after the discussion was over. Weld was happy to oblige, even asking people with questions to come down to the front.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI thought it was very interesting,\u201d attendee Ninos Mansor said. \u201cNot surprising that he studied at Harvard.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Other attendees said they found the talk interesting, with many saying they wished Weld was at the top of the Libertarian ticket.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe\u2019s definitely much more polished,\u201d Mansor added.</span></p>"}

{"title": "What You Leave Behind | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Whatever you set out to do, you usually justify it by telling yourself or others something along the lines of \u201cI want to make a lasting legacy.\u201d But what exactly does that mean?<br></span></p> <p><span>It seems to me that when most people talk of legacy, they mean to create some sort of object that would last forever and speak to one\u2019s achievement, like a Roman statue that attested to an emperor\u2019s greatness. However, like many objects of history and great achievement such as the Great Wall of China or the Mona Lisa, there is a tendency for these things to deteriorate into rubble and residue.</span></p> <p><span>So it\u2019s hard to say that legacy in any line of work would last forever. But it\u2019s tempting to want such a thing. Just take a look at the conversation around President Obama\u2019s last year in office.</span></p> <p><span>Commenting on the President\u2019s speech at this year\u2019s Democratic National Convention, Vox\u2019s Matthew Yglesias \u201803 makes the <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/7/27/12303476/obama-democratic-convention-speech\">argument</a> that the President likely considers that this election will make or break his legacy. If Clinton wins the election, \u201cObama\u2019s America\u201d will be preserved. If Trump wins, \u201cit will all wash away as a strange anomaly.\u201d However, such terms inadequately describe the impact of the President\u2019s efforts.</span></p> <p><span>On one hand, to think that Obama\u2019s America could be preserved if Clinton won the presidency overestimates the power of the presidency. Just as Reagan\u2019s America existed for a moment and no longer exists today, Obama\u2019s America will disappear and transform into something different.</span></p> <p><span>On the other hand, believing that the President\u2019s work would be completely washed away if Trump won underestimates Obama\u2019s impact. His efforts to provide healthcare, mend the economy, and wage a war on terror have affected many people and will continue to have residual effects in the future.</span></p> <p><span>However much one wants to believe that the impact of one\u2019s work will be eternal\u2014or however much one wants another\u2019s legacy to be obliterated\u2014it is unrealistic to put things in such terms.</span></p> <p><span>How, then, should people view their work and its legacy? I suppose that when people say they want to make a lasting impact, what they are really talking about is wanting to leave behind a certain kind of residue.</span></p> <p><span>What do I mean by residue? Let us take as an example a typical Harvard student. A typical student might have an A- GPA, belong to one or two extracurricular activities that they put a substantial amount of time into, take an internship or two, and have a close group of friends with which they spend most of their time. In each of these efforts, students leave behind a residue of themselves as a result of the time they devoted.</span></p> <p><span>You might not consider the work or the impact of a college student to be all that significant. But these very small efforts make up college life. Contributing in section, volunteering for a few hours for PBHA, or simply eating lunch with your block mates all leave behind small amounts of residue that contribute to a heap left behind by generations of typical Harvard students. And it is this heap that, every year, incoming freshmen come to know and graduating seniors take a piece from to take with them.</span></p> <p><span>Looking at work and its impact this way, the efforts of a college student can be considered just as important as the efforts of the President. Although the President\u2019s work does leave behind a large amount of residue, it is in no way wholly constitutive of the American people\u2019s present or future experience. It is simply another amount that contributes to people\u2019s lives, which are accumulations of pieces of countless other people.</span></p> <p><span>This kind of impact and legacy may not seem as grand as a project that will last forever. However, one\u2019s work can live on in other ways. Even if, say, Trump were to be elected president and reverse many of President Obama\u2019s executive orders, we might still think about the President\u2019s efforts in terms of residue and conclude that his executive orders could live on as inspiration for future legislation, court cases, or even grassroots movements. Even if your life\u2019s work cannot live on literally, people will take what they can from your legacy and build from there.</span></p> <p><span>Similarly, what we do here at Harvard could live on in many ways. That paper you wrote for class could turn into a senior thesis. The friend that you always had long conversations over lunch with could turn into a business partner. These residues act as the basic materials for building deep, meaningful lives. Given this, I think it\u2019s important to always keep the following question in mind: What residue would you like to leave behind?</span></p> <p><span><em><br></em></span></p> <p><span><em>Dan A.

{"title": "Yellow Love, Politics, and Poetry | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Everyone loves Constance Wu. She has a sick, no-nonsense TV persona. She\u2019s one of the few public figures who\u2019ll <a href=\"http://time.com/4433113/constance-wu-matt-damon-great-wall/\">cuss</a> out the white kids saving China with a Tumblr-like vengeance. A couple of weeks ago she took a <a href=\"https://www.yomyomf.com/yes-constance-wu-can-have-a-white-boyfriend-still-advocate-for-asian-americans/\">picture</a> with her white boyfriend\u2019s lips glued to her face, smiling like no one\u2019s business. The yellow boys started out asking what she was doing with this \u201c<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hapas/comments/4nlt58/constance_wu_and_her_average_white_boyfriend/\">mediocre</a>\u201d Moby Dick. Someone made a Reddit page called \u201cConstance Wu and her average white boyfriend.\u201d The yellow boys got called out because men shouldn\u2019t feel entitled to women\u2019s bodies, or we live in 2016, or Wu really seems to be in love.<br></span></p> <p><span>Love\u2019s workings should be unrelated to those of politics. But at the same time, there\u2019s nothing more political than deciding whom you mess with, whose experiences you take on as your own. It seems in every public context other than Asian-American activism, partnerships are factored unapologetically, essentially, into identity. Who did not point to Melania\u2019s plagiarism as a display, also, of Trump\u2019s inadequacy; her immigrant status as contradictory to his nativist rhetoric? Who does not view the Bill aspect to Clinton\u2019s presidential run as significant, a contribution to her identity as an insider? We talk about the social significance of Michelle Obama\u2019s skin color, <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2009/1/30/690881/-\">darker</a> than the president\u2019s. There are sociologies and national histories and tropes that solely exist to define who cuffs you up, because there are white trophy wives to rich black men, skinny yellow boys to hallyu\u2019d-up white girls, black girls to hip-hop posing yellow boys, and of course, white boys to yellow girls. There are forces beyond fluffiness and attraction that bring people together.</span></p> <p><span>In some ways, the yellow boys are asking the same question as the rest of us: Is it ever possible to love an idea, a country, a cause, as deeply or completely or powerfully as you could love another human being?</span></p> <p><span>For yellow females, it is simple to paint the white-boy-yellow-girl pairing as a place in which we are always, continually, and forever victims. We claim we are fetishized; we sing about misogyny. We say we are judged unfairly, because yes, love is not activism, sex is not an essay. But yellow fever doesn\u2019t explain our complicity. Locking away the opinions of the people we represent is not calling someone out. In our models, we critique the opinions of everyone except for our own because our models are based on denial. We need to utilize a model of the world in which we have control over our bodies. Agency is a timely, weighted concept.</span></p> <p><span>The backlash against Constance Wu\u2019s boyfriend is not just, or even mostly, about Constance Wu. It is, instead, a response to seemingly continual proof that love is not possible without whiteness. It would be ignorant to deny that our community\u2019s identity lies in the forces that bring a disproportionate amount of yellow men and women to white lovers. Even our love poetry contemplates whiteness, on how we can hate whiteness but love its people. Jenny Zhang <a href=\"http://www.rookiemag.com/2015/04/far-away-from-me/3/\">asks</a>, \u201cHow could I have loved these men who wanted a living China doll instead of a three-dimensional woman?\u201d In a bone-hard personal essay, she concludes that it is possible to really love a fetishizer and to be really loved by one. Because to some extent, we are always, no matter the color of our lovers, imagining our partners wrong, buying into the illusion that convinces us of their worthiness. Because our racialized desire to be accepted is also a part of us, a want we can\u2019t separate from our intangible needs. Ocean Vuong, who <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/detail/57586\">pleads</a> to his partner, \u201cSay autumn despite the green in your eyes,\u201d will never stop writing poetry in which his small-Vietnamese-boyness does not surround his language, his desires. What does it mean if, in our poetry, a partner\u2019s climax is equitable to surrender? What does it mean if we imagine ourselves next to Trevors who are \u201ctoo fast &amp; not enough\u201d or who toss \u201cpanties in the lake <em>for fun</em>;\u201d what if we really are \u201cyellow &amp; nearly nothing\u201d? Yes, there are Asian-Asian couples as well: Helen Zia and Lia Shigemura, MC Jin and Carol Au-Yeung, Randall and Jae Suh Park. But these relationships are not presented as thought-over, snuck-into, poeticized, sexed-out, or struggled as their interracial counterparts. They do not compose our poetry, our romance, our big bad dreams.</span></p> <p><span>But we cannot ignore the forces that may drive an interracial relationship: the tendency to fetishize and the desire to be accepted, the integration of stereotypes into illusion and the adoption of whiteness as ideal. And though it is generally coarse, rash, and misdirected, the critique of Constance Wu as \u201chypocritical\u201d is not illogical. Because the representatives of our community truly do contradict themselves, in ways that demonstrate superficial advocacy for our community but never real love for it. Like when, on Season 6 of America\u2019s Next Top Model, Gina Choe talked about representing Asian Americans in the modeling world, then claimed that she didn\u2019t date Asian men because they were \u201c<a href=\"https://antm411.com/category/gina-choe/\">too short</a>\u201d for her. Even I wonder how strong, deep, a person\u2019s sense of identity can be if too much of it revolves around explaining it to someone incapable of feeling it. I wonder how much of our activism\u2019s language is created with white partners as the implied audience. Because I know when I talk about representation, fetishization, emasculation, I am pleading to be seen. For my people to know that they are as good, as beautiful, as interesting lovers as white people.</span></p> <p><span>I talk about love because I know the power of two bodies with the same glisten as the hotel room\u2019s fade. I know what\u2019s behind the picture. When I see you see me. To yellow kids who know. With you, everything I touch turns to gold. I didn\u2019t choose you for comfort. Not because I was supposed to. I chose you because you see me. And when you closed your eyes I was loving the tear marks on your cheeks.</span></p> <p><span><br></span></p> <p><span><em>Christina M.

His die-hard supporters are just as much in denial. In fact, they, not his ever-shrinking inner circle of former pollster Kellyanne Conway and erstwhile Breitbart editor Steve Bannon, are the ones enabling this delusion, roaring their approval as he dismisses the tales of his campaign\u2019s demise as exaggerations by a scurrilous media.

(I\u2019ll be the first to predict a Bob Dylan landslide in 2020, should he choose to accept it!)</span></p> <p><span>And just check out the polls! No, the real polls, not the \u201ccrooked\u201d ones that show him <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/\">far behind Hillary Clinton in swing states</a> and losing his grasp on Republican necessities like <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/arizona/\">Arizona</a> and even <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/alaska/\">Alaska</a>. If you want to really know who won Sunday\u2019s debate, look at the (nonrandom and nonscientific) polls on the websites of Drudge, Time, and Breitbart (which he admitted was, I kid you not, \u201cslightly conservative\u201d).</span></p> <p><span>The great irony is that Trump was once a great believer in actual polling. Trump taught data journalists (and optimists worldwide) a stunning, valuable lesson with his victory in the Republican nomination. Trump tweeted polls gleefully throughout the primary process; he took the lead <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-national-gop-primary\">in early July</a> 2015 and never looked back. But pundits, often criticized as obsessed with the horse race, maintained a gradually waning confidence that he was a Herman Cain-style flash in the pan, even as his lead lasted...and lasted.</span></p> <p><span>Nate Silver, a founding father of data journalism and frequent defender of the poll, wrote an <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/donald-trumps-six-stages-of-doom/\">uncharacteristically gut-feeling-based piece</a> last August that defined the genre and possibly shaped the Trump-bearish conventional wisdom. He estimated Trump\u2019s odds of winning the nomination at just two percent.</span></p> <p><span>In defense of Silver, the two percent figure, which he called \u201cabsurd specificity,\u201d may actually have been correct: Things with two percent likelihood happen all the time (<a href=\"http://www.math.harvard.edu/\">about one in 50 times!</a>), and Trump\u2019s rise required the spectacular failure of the Republican establishment to unite behind an alternative. I would even argue that something as minor as the \u201cRubiobot\u201d incident, which happened when Marco Rubio was coalescing establishment support following a strong finish in Iowa, could have given Trump the election, and the <a href=\"https://electionbettingodds.com/GOP_chart_maxim_lott_john_stossel.html\">betting markets agree</a>.</span></p> <p><span>Silver also wrote a <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-i-acted-like-a-pundit-and-screwed-up-on-donald-trump/\">fantastic mea culpa</a>, \u201cHow I Acted Like a Pundit and Screwed Up on Donald Trump.\u201d The takeaway is that data journalists didn\u2019t fail to predict Trump because the data was wrong; they failed because they ignored the data. Public opinion polls don\u2019t have a perfect track record in primaries, far from it. But they\u2019re among the only information we have. When confident Trump supporters and panicking liberals cite Trump\u2019s unexpected primary victories as a reason not to count Trump out just yet, they\u2019re missing the point: People underestimated Trump in spite of the polls, not because of them. In fact, Trump actually slightly underperformed his polls, perhaps because his voters typically had voted less in previous elections than other candidates\u2019.</span></p> <p><span>Now that they show Trump trailing by such a margin that a <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-there-any-precedent-for-a-trump-comeback/\">comeback would be unprecedented</a>, the campaign that made tweeting polls cool is offering no shortage of increasingly dubious reasons that the polls don\u2019t matter. Most are easily refuted with a simple question: What about, you know, the very recent past?</span></p> <p><span>The polls are missing Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mitchellvii/status/786266978566701056\">supposed deluge of new voters</a>? They didn\u2019t miss them in the primaries. They <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mitchellvii/status/786265233325223936\">oversample Democrats</a>? Take it up with <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/11/whole-romney-ticket-believed-unskewed-polls/321618/\">President Romney</a>. The pollsters are just \u201ccrooked\u201d and set on destroying Trump\u2019s candidacy?

Anderson Cooper, who was interviewing Conway, observed that <a href=\"http://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/\">46 percent is better than 37 percent</a>. \u201cOne needs not be a pollster to know that,\u201d Conway retorted.

{"title": "Non-Conference Play Continues for Ancient Eight | Sports | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Gant Player", "body": "<p><span>\u00adIt\u2019s the middle of October and that means two things: the Presidential race is heating up, and Ivy League football is in full swing. The two are a lot more similar than you might think. Both are heated races between an eclectic group of contestants that are vying for a relatively meaningless prize (seriously, how much power does the leader of the free world ACTUALLY have?).</span></p> <p><span>On top of that, in the heat of both races, an unlikely hero wearing red has emerged. From the Presidential race, I\u2019m obviously talking about my boy Kenneth Bone! Out of ashes of the awfulness that was the last debate, we were taken into the BONE ZONE. Nothing better than his red sweater and gnarly mustache. As for the Ivies, I\u2019m looking at you, Cornell. Didn\u2019t think you\u2019d win a game to be honest.</span></p> <p><span>We have the clear front-runners whose names begin with H. There\u2019s the orange one that\u2019s basically from New York (Princeton is practically right in the city!). Then there\u2019s the guy who probably can\u2019t name any foreign leaders because, frankly, they\u2019re just not as good a candidate as the rest. That one is Yale. Cause people who go to Yale aren\u2019t as smart or good-looking or cool as people who go to Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>Will this season end up being as much of a mess as the presidential race? We\u2019ll find out soon enough. But this week, smack-dab in the middle of Ivy  play, we have the last set of non-conference games as well as a few Ivy League matchups. Let\u2019s get into some predictions.</span></p> <p><span>HARVARD AT HOLY CROSS</span></p> <p><span>Just like my girl Hillary is going to obliterate the Donald in Massachusetts, the Crimson is going to come out guns blazing in this matchup after beating Cornell in what might be its toughest matchup of the season.</span></p> <p><span>Holy Cross has already lost to one Ivy League team this season, Dartmouth. I\u2019ll get into Dartmouth\u2019s struggles a little later, but suffice it to say, they aren\u2019t all they\u2019re cracked up to be this season. So Harvard is going to roll through this matchup pretty easily.</span></p> <p><span>Prediction: Harvard 42, Holy Cross 13</span></p> <p><span>YALE AT FORDHAM</span></p> <p><span>Fordham has looked pretty solid this year. They\u2019re 3-2, and one of those losses came to Navy who just beat Houston. They\u2019ve beaten one of the better Ivies in Penn, and they\u2019re coming off a 24 point victory against a conference opponent.</span></p> <p><span>Yale, on the other hand, is 1-3 overall and has only beaten Dartmouth so far. They\u2019ve only scored more than 21 points once, and they\u2019ve given up a combined 118 points to non-conference opponents so far. Oh, by the way, Fordham put up 83 on an opponent this year.</span></p> <p><span>Yale\u2019s non-conference struggles will continue this week.</span></p> <p><span>Prediction: Fordham 49, Yale 17</span></p> <p><span>SACRED HEART AT CORNELL</span></p> <p><span>What a surprise, am I right? Cornell is so good this year! I mean, they lost to Harvard, but so does everyone. Other than that, they\u2019ve rolled straight through their opponents, surprisingly enough. Check out the preview from last week for more info on how bad Cornell has been in the past. They are, however, playing a Sacred Heart team that\u2019s 4-1 on the season. Regardless, I\u2019m cheering for Cornell. Everyone likes a surprise. Like the Oakland Raiders. Or Donald Trump.</span></p> <p><span>Prediction: Cornell 31, Sacred Heart 21</span></p> <p><span>TOWSON AT DARTMOUTH</span></p> <p><span>To be perfectly honest, I\u2019ve never heard of Towson before. Apparently it\u2019s in Maryland. Who cares. They\u2019ve lost all but one this season including a blowout loss to USF in the season opener. At least they\u2019re playing good teams. Dartmouth is 0-2 in the Ivy League and lost to Yale, but they were supposed to be Harvard\u2019s toughest competition this season. To quote Obi Wan Kenobi, \u201cYou were the chosen one!\u201d Well I\u2019m choosing you to lose. So hah! Just kidding, Dartmouth has this one.</span></p> <p><span>Prediction: Dartmouth 24, Towson 17</span></p> <p><span>COLUMBIA AT PENN</span></p> <p><span>Big surprise: Columbia is bad at football. They\u2019re 1-3 so far even losing to Georgetown. Penn, on the other hand, will very likely be the Crimson\u2019s biggest game this season. They\u2019re 2-2 but are undefeated in the Ivies and lost to the powerhouses that are Fordham and Lehigh. As upset as I am that I have to go to Philadelphia to watch the game against Harvard, just as much as I believe that it\u2019s ridiculous a football team\u2019s mascot is named after a group of pacifists, I also believe in Penn.</span></p> <p><span>Prediction: Penn 35, Columbia 10</span></p> <p><span>BROWN AT PRINCETON</span></p> <p><span>I don\u2019t know. Princeton is 3-1. They\u2019ll probably win, right?</span></p> <p><span>Prediction: Princeton 42, Brown 17</span></p> <p><span>Staff writer Gant Player can be reached at</span></p> <p><span>wplayer@college.harvard.edu.</span></p>"}

He loved to brag about his ratings, and he knew how to draw attention to himself,\u201d Zucker said.</span></p> <p><span>Zucker denied having any insight into a recently unearthed video from 2005 of Trump, featuring the Republican nominee making lewd comments about women.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI would say what is out there now, I\u2019m unaware of any of that,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was certainly not in the context of the way I knew him.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Attendee Betty Pu viewed Zucker as being overly \u201cdefensive of CNN.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Another attendee, Chandler Beyer admired Zucker\u2019s insistence in abstaining from endorsing one of the candidates.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI really appreciated how he stayed firm on not saying what political candidate he supported,\u201d Beyer said. \u201cI think that really is imperative to staying as unbiased as possible.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Zucker also outlined the ways in which he believes he has changed CNN\u2019s trajectory for the better as CNN Worldwide president. The three strategies he outlined were \u201cgoing all in\u201d on the big news stories, creating original series for CNN\u2019s television channel, and investing in the development of its digital platform to grow its millennial viewer base.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that traditional news organizations have wanted to chase millennials,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are the number one source of news information of any digital platform in the world.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>During the conversation, Romano brought up a previous comment Zucker made about Buzzfeed, another popular digital platform, in which he called Buzzfeed not a \u201clegitimate news organization.\u201d She pointed out that he recently hired their political investigatory research team.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI said they weren\u2019t a real news organization\u2014they are a real news organization,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Before joining CNN as its president in 2013, Zucker spent 25 years at NBC Universal, where he served as the Entertainment President from 2000 to 2004 before becoming the CEO in 2007.</span></p> <p><span>When an audience member asked Zucker to look back at how his time at Harvard shaped where he is now, Zucker said being the former president of The Crimson gave him a \u201ctremendous foundation for journalism.\u201d</span></p>"}
{"title": "I am Not Your Enemy | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>For pre-orientation one year ago, I chose the First-Year Urban Program\u2014a whirlwind week of social justice in both debate and practice. We lived with no air conditioning, donated breakfast in garbage bags, and sandwiches with only one piece of ham. At night, we debated all the intricacies of privilege, BGLTQ rights, feminism, and police brutality.</span></p> <p><span>While this social justice thing was completely new to me, it was also the only part of Harvard where I felt like I fit in. As a lower-middle class, Chinese-American woman, I was not made for Harvard. But in the social justice community, I found others who shared my experiences, my story, and my values\u2014a group of \u201cothers\u201d that became a lifeline I held on to tightly.</span></p> <p><span>First semester of freshman year, I volunteered for the Phillips Brooks House Association, took Professor Matthew Desmond\u2019s class on poverty in America, read Upworthy articles religiously, and even cried over a debate on assimilation. I objected more than a few times when someone talked about BGLTQ issues or sexual assault without a \u201crepresentative\u201d in the room. I cringed when \u201cAfrican-American\u201d and \u201cBlack\u201d were used incorrectly. I established myself as an authority on all things Asian.</span></p> <p><span>I embraced these exacting habits because FUP wasn\u2019t just the first time I learned about social justice\u2014it was the first time I felt validated, heard, honest, and powerful. It was the first time I realized I have a right to be myself, a right to be passionate, a right to demand change. But I also quickly discovered that the social justice community isn\u2019t perfect.</span></p> <p><span>To claim a place in this \u201caccepting\u201d community, I had to think perfectly, talk perfectly, act perfectly, live perfectly. There was no room for unintended marginalization, for career considerations that paid too high, for ignorance towards the ever-expanding set of causes that the social justice movement adopts. As much as I want to sympathize, too much of it is unacceptably exclusive.</span></p> <p><span>Instead of focusing on the very real \u201cbigots\u201d of this world and tackling head-on the political structures of inequality, the loudest voices of the movement have become preoccupied with witch-hunting for \u201cfake liberals.\u201d There is this strange conviction that only the most extreme versions of a position can be true, and that all minor deviations, all attempts to compromise or to even consider the other side are forms of bigotry.</span></p> <p><span>The result of this extremity is a tendency to prioritize flashiness over truth. It means that if, as a woman, you suggest that being careful with clothing, especially when walking by yourself, is a good way to reduce the risk of sexual assault, you will be immediately caricatured as blaming women for rape. It means that if you talk about the higher SAT and GPA scores needed for Asian-Americans in college applications in a debate about affirmative action, you will be immediately shut down as trying to pit minorities against each other.</span></p> <p><span>Using exaggeration and shame to deny the tension of real nuances is both ignorant and irresponsible. No issue that deals with thousands of people can be so crudely simplified. And if my unwillingness to support these exaggerations earns me the ultimate disqualifier of \u201ccenter-left,\u201d that is the identity I want to embrace. Because this active polarization is more than a Harvard drama\u2014it is a denial of humanity to the rest of this country.</span></p> <p><span>As someone who comes from a lower-middle class neighborhood of moderate conservatives, I can\u2019t support this criminalization of conservatism. I not only know but also have friends who are Trump supporters. I hate the misogynistic and racist elements of the modern Republican Party, but the \u201cangry white men\u201d who have been deserted by their manufacturing jobs are the past owners of foreclosed houses in my city. These are people who can barely afford to get by, let alone have the time to concern themselves with social justice. And to believe that this world can move forward in hatred of these people is a mistake.</span></p> <p><span>Social justice does not justify exclusion. And acceptance cannot involve putting someone\u2019s politics above their humanity. We cannot truly claim to embrace diversity when we expect everyone on the inside to look the same. People like me may not be \u201cperfect\u201d by your standards of social justice, but as a \u201creal\u201d liberal, I am also trying to make this world a better place.</span></p> <p><span>And I am not your enemy.</span></p> <p><span><em><br></em></span></p> <p><span><em>Elizabeth Y.

It was moderated by New York Times columnist Ross G. Douthat \u201902. </span></p> <p><span>Douthat, a former Crimson columnist, said from the onset that he hoped the discussion would bridge some of the gaps that exist in the historical and popular record.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cPeople have more limited knowledge than they should of political conservatism, and particularly, religious conservatism,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>In light of the presidential election, much of the event focused on the split between grassroots and establishment conservatism. Michelle Nickerson, who teaches history at Loyola University Chicago, said current divides between Republican presidential nominee Donald J. Trump and other members of the GOP have led to confusion over the definition of conservatism.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to determine who the real conservatives are,\u201d she said. \u201cHistorically, we haven\u2019t always been able to differentiate between grassroots and elitist conservatives, which leads us to ask who we want to put forward as representatives of conservatism.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>However, Arizona State University history professor Donald Critchlow had a different take on the election and said Trump has changed political tactics more than the definition of conservatism.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cFigures such as Trump can be conservative, but their political tactics can be separated from their beliefs,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Beyond the election, Douthat said in an interview that the fact that academia has been <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/2/10/faculty-donate-clinton-2016/\">dominated by liberals</a> adds to a lack of knowledge about conservatism on <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/10/1/conservatives-scrutiny-oct-2015/\">college campuses</a> in particular.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere were conservative and liberal activist movements [in the 1960s]. What tended to happen was that conservative activists didn\u2019t tend to go into academia whereas the liberal activists did,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Charmaine Yoest, a senior fellow at American Values, a conservative organization, argued that a lack of trust towards conservatives has led to gaps in historical archives and general knowledge.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe fear of the other, especially in politics, can often harm productivity,\u201d she said.</span></p> <p><span>Yoest said that modern culture and technology can further harm trust.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere is an increasing problem of having silos and filter bubbles online, where none of us are getting enough info that comes at us,\u201d she said.</span></p> <p><span>But Yoest said there are ways to remedy political polarization. She suggested becoming familiar with different points of view can help bridge the trust gap.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere\u2019s no shortcut to bridging the trust gap, there is only constant interaction,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to be more intentional in our personal news gathering, to resist the increasing partisan Balkanization we have in our culture, which is creeping in because of the choice we now have in what we consume.\u201d</span></p>"}

Foley discussed his new book, \u201cBallot Battles: The History of Disputed Elections in the United States,\u201d at the Kennedy School\u2019s Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation on Thursday. He presented his findings on disputed elections throughout history and advocated for concrete legal measures to prevent future controversies.</span></p> <p><span>Referencing the <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/10/20/students-react-final-presidential-debate/\">final U.S. presidential debate</a> that took place Wednesday night, Foley began his talk by drawing a parallel between the current election and the 1876 presidential election, in which a divided Congress disagreed on the vote count days before the inauguration.</span></p> <p><span>Foley attributed the \u201cpassive voice\u201d in the 12th Amendment as cause for dispute in U.S. elections. That the 12th Amendment states \u201cthe votes shall then be counted\u201d is, he said, \u201cthe Achilles\u2019 heel in U.S. legislation.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe passive voice doesn\u2019t assign responsibility,\u201d Foley said. \u201cWho actually counts the votes? [The founding fathers] never thought there would be an issue about it.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Foley noted that personal virtue and a candidate\u2019s respect for the electoral system can often resolve the issue in highly disputed elections. In the hotly contested 1792 New York gubernatorial election between John Jay and George Clinton, Foley explained, founding father Alexander Hamilton advised Jay to concede defeat. This set a precedent: The losing candidate should concede despite personal issue with the electoral rules.</span></p> <p><span>In his talk, Foley gave other examples of U.S. election disputes. Some resulted in concessions, such as Nixon\u2019s voluntary termination of his 1960 presidential bid, while others resulted in violence, such as the assassination in 1900 of a Kentucky gubernatorial candidate.</span></p> <p><span>Foley argued that non-partisan courts are the best way to resolve disputed elections.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cCourts are better than legislatures\u2014we risk the rawest of raw partisan greed if we let legislatures rule,\u201d Foley said. \u201cIt is up to us to create an institution that is robust enough to handle any instances where the rules aren\u2019t perfect.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Following Foley\u2019s talk, several Kennedy School students asked questions about the 2000 presidential election between George W. Bush and Al Gore \u201969, as well as voiced their concerns about the current election.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe most interesting thing to realize is how often this happened and how chaotic the process has been when it is a dire crisis,\u201d said Seth N. Soderborg, a Graduate School of Arts and Sciences student who has studied disputed elections in Indonesia and Brazil. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a single set of rules governing both how elections are administered and who is a voter in different parts of the country.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Foley painted a picture of short-term pragmatism and long-term optimism at the end of his talk.</span></p>"}

Thirteen current U.S. senators can claim ties to Harvard, bearing degrees from the College, the Law School, or the Kennedy School. Pending the results of this election, that number could rise to 14 after Nov. 8. </span></p> <p><span>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s surprising,\u201d professor of government and sociology Theda Skocpol said of Harvard\u2019s representation in the Senate. \u201cWe know Harvard, along with a few other institutions, are elite colleges that set people up for success.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The Harvard graduates running for reelection to the Senate are Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal \u201967 from Connecticut, Republican Senator Michael D. Crapo\u2014a Law School graduate from the Class of 1977\u2014from Idaho, Democratic Senator Charles E. Schumer \u201971 from New York, and Republican <span class=\"il\">Senator</span> Patrick J. Toomey \u201984 from Pennsylvania.</span></p> <p><span>Democratic candidate Russell D. Feingold\u2013who graduated from HLS in 1979\u2013from Wisconsin is also running for reelection to the Senate, though not as an incumbent. Feingold served as Wisconsin\u2019s senator from 1993 to 2011 before suffering a defeat in his 2010 campaign for reelection at the hands of Oshkosh businessman Republican Ron Johnson.</span></p> <p><span>FiveThirtyEight, a website known for its elections predictions, currently gives Blumenthal, Crapo, Schumer, and Feingold high chances of winning their individual Senate races: 98.8 percent, 98.9 percent, 99.9 percent, and 91.1 percent, respectively. According to the site, the Senatorial races in Connecticut, Idaho, and New York are unlikely to play a significant role in deciding whether the Democrats or Republicans gain a majority of the chamber\u2013Wisconsin, however, may.</span></p> <p><span>This year, more than twice as many Republican-held Senate seats are up for election as Democratic seats: 24 as opposed to 10, allowing Democrats to go on the offensive in their quest to take back the majority. Democrats must gain a net five additional seats to win numerical control of the Senate. If Democratic presidential nominee Hillary R. Clinton gains the White House, however, Democrats need nab just four, given that the Vice President\u2019s vote can serve as a tiebreaker.</span></p> <p><span>Wisconsin, where Feingold is running against incumbent Johnson, is one of the states likely to switch hands this election, and could help Democrats seize a Senatorial majority. FiveThirtyEight ranks Wisconsin\u2019s \u201ctipping-point chance,\u201d or the probability that the state\u2019s Senate race will decide whether Democrats or Republicans attain a majority, at 2.9 percent.</span></p> <p><span>Lee M. Miringoff, the director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, said he agreed with FiveThirtyEight\u2019s assessment of Wisconsin, deeming it \u201ca pretty pivotal state\u201d for both political parties. He added that Democrats are \u201cbanking on\u201d Feingold, as a former senator to reclaim his seat.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThat would be one of the four seats Democrats would have to pick up, assuming they win the presidency,\u201d Miringoff said. \u201cIt would be very hard for the Democrats to get to 50 [Senate seats] without picking up a Wisconsin seat and flipping that back to the Democratic column.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Miringoff disagreed, however, with FiveThirtyEight\u2019s confident projection of a Feingold victory. Referencing polling data from RealClearPolitics, which gives Feingold a slim advantage over Johnson, Miringoff said he thinks Feingold has only a \u201csingle digit lead.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAlthough FiveThirtyEight might have it at 91 percent, it\u2019s probably closer than that,\u201d he said. \u201cSomething that\u2019s within the margin of error is something that you can\u2019t count on at this point. I think it\u2019s still competitive.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Other senators with Harvard degrees not currently up for reelection include Tim Kaine, an HLS alum and Clinton\u2019s pick for vice presidential running mate, and Law School graduate Ted Cruz, who ran for the 2016 Republican nomination before losing to Donald J.

Trump may give a whole new meaning to the phrase \u201cthe elephant in the room.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>As the populist appeal of the Republican presidential nominee burned its way through the nation this past year, some students in the ivory tower at Harvard have felt the heat of his message, too. Just don\u2019t expect them to walk around wearing \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats.</span></p> <p><span>Surrounded mostly by liberal-minded peers and abandoned politically by the Harvard Republican Club, which took the unprecedented step of publicly denouncing its own Party\u2019s standard-bearer as <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/8/5/republican-club-not-support-trump/\">\u201ca threat to the survival of the Republic</a>\u201d in August, a small number of undergraduates still count themselves as Trump supporters.</span></p> <p><span>Overwhelmingly in the minority, some pro-Trump students have shied from speaking openly about their political preference.<br></span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf someone asks who I am voting for, I have no problem telling them Trump, but I\u2019m not about to put a \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 sticker on my Macbook,\" said Republican Club member Luke K. Kelly \u201919.</span></p> <p><span>A <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/10/4/plurality-republican-club-supports-johnson/\">straw poll</a> sent out to members of the Harvard Republican Club this summer found a comparably small minority\u201412 percent of respondents\u2014said they supported Trump, compared to 20 percent who supported Democratic nominee Hillary R. Clinton and 36 percent who supported Libertarian Party nominee Gary E. Johnson. Roughly 50 club members indicated their preferences in the poll, according to Alexander J. Cullen \u201918, the Republican Club\u2019s secretary.</span></p> <p><span>The Republican Club also took the extraordinary step of condemning Trump in a statement, writing that the candidate was \u201cpoisoning our country and our children\u201d The denouncement drew widespread attention from the likes of The Washington Post and CNN.</span></p> <p><span>Still, some Trump supporters remain resolute in their support for Trump. Cullen said that he has not felt silenced when it come to expressing his political views, and even wrote an <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/10/4/cullen-defense-donald-trump/\">op-ed in The Crimson</a> entitled \u201cIn Defense of Donald Trump.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been oppressive or anything,\u201d Cullen said. \u201cBut it has been a little tough to speak out at times, especially as the only [Republican Club] board member who supports Trump.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Others, though, have chosen to keep their political preferences to themselves. One Trump supporter declined to comment for this article, citing a discomfort with publicly expressing political opinions. Thayer D. Wade, who is currently taking off what would be his senior fall to work as a field representative for the Trump campaign in New Hampshire, did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</span></p> <p><span>Trump supporters on Harvard's campus are greatly outnumbered. In <a href=\"http://features.thecrimson.com/2016/freshman-survey/lifestyle/\">The Crimson\u2019s survey</a> of the College\u2019s incoming Class of 2020, just six percent of respondents said they planned on voting for Trump in the November\u2019s election, compared to 80 percent who planned to vote for Clinton. A <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/11/5/crimson-presidential-poll-2012/\">2012 Crimson election survey</a> of undergraduate and graduate students found 17 percent of respondents planned on voting for Republican nominee Mitt Romney.<br></span></p> <p><span>In fact, Republican Club President Declan P. Garvey \u201917 said that the club has \u201cno qualms\u201d with its members crossing the aisle this election to vote for Clinton, who they might see as \u201cthe lesser of two evils.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI\u2019m registered in Illinois\u2014not a swing state\u2014so I feel comfortable voting third-party,\u201d added Garvey. \u201cBut if I were registered in a swing state like Florida or Colorado or Ohio, I would very likely vote for Hillary Clinton\u2013which is a testament to just how dangerous I believe Donald Trump to be, given the many misgivings I have with Hillary Clinton and her candidacy.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Still, Cullen and Kelly defended Trump\u2014even on some of his more controversial policies and remarks.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cTrump believes in the greatness of this country and the boundless potential of the American people,\u201d Cullen said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s always the general premise I start off with in explaining why I support Trump\u2014his policies flow out of his care for his people.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>At the same time, however, both conceded that Trump is not without his faults. Particularly in light of recently unearthed footage which showed Trump making extremely lewd comments in 2005 about groping and trying to have sex with women, Cullen said the incident, \u201cdefinitely made me think. I don\u2019t in any way excuse remarks like that, since they contradict how I strive to treat women.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>However, \u201cstill standing by Trump through this scrutiny,\u201d he contrasted Trump\u2019s response to the scandal with Clinton\u2019s reaction to her own email controversy.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cTrump confronted the footage, saying he was not proud of it, and that he will be a better man from this day forward,\u201d Cullen said. \u201cWith Clinton, I have not seen the same forthright apology regarding the email scandal, which in fact is much more costly than Trump\u2019s video.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Focusing in on Clinton in particular, both supporters warned the alternative to a Trump presidency could be much worse.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIs [Trump] a perfect candidate? By no means,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cBut he is the best option we\u2019re left with to turn the tide of Obama\u2019s failed policies.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>While Trump and his supporters have complained about how the media has treated the candidate, Kelly said the narrative that paints Trump\u2019s followers as \u201cdeplorables\u201d misses a core tenet of his appeal.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt is easy for the media to supply the narrative that Trump supporters are racist, xenophobic, or \u2018deplorable,\u2019 but they are ignoring the very real struggles that many Americans have, which have been caused by Obama and will only continue under Clinton,\u201d Kelly said.</span></p> <p><span>Further diving into the specifics of a laundry list of policy issues, Cullen said he was encouraged to see that Trump intended to strengthen the U.S. military, stem illegal immigration, and bring jobs back to America.</span></p> <p><span>Neither were shy about addressing Trump\u2019s critics either.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cA lot of people have labeled him as anti-Hispanic, or anti-Muslim,\u201d Cullen said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cPeople are quick to make fun of the Skittles,\u201d he added, referring to a Twitter post in which Donald Trump, Jr. compared Syrian refugees to a bowl of Skittles sprinkled with a few that \u201cwould kill you.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you would use candy, but there is some truth to the argument,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there is a small percentage of fundamentalist Islamists that could get into our country and initiate some sort of attack, then it makes sense to implement a stricter vetting process.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>As the Harvard Republican Club moves away from Trump and focuses on down-ballot races, Cullen said he thought the club was making a strategic mistake.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI reserve the utmost respect for the other board members of the [Harvard Republican Club],\u201d Cullen said. \u201cBut their decision not to endorse Trump was overly far-sighted. Their philosophy is to regroup and try again in 2020\u2014that underestimates the damage a Clinton presidency could do to our country.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Derek G.

{"title": "\u200bSo What Do You Believe? | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>I assumed that the questioning would stop with my application essay. This is it, I remember thinking to myself, as I wrapped up frantically spell-checking my supplement for the third time. I\u2019ve told Harvard everything it ever needs to know about me.<br></span></p> <p><span>How wrong I was.</span></p> <p><span>I think the realization hit sometime during my first section for my government course. I flipped through my notes, desperately searching for something halfway intelligent-sounding to contribute to a discussion on whether the dominance of established economic powers precludes the growth of developing nations. Never mind that this was one of the most enduring and hotly-debated enigmas of 21st-century international relations. I was expected to have an answer, and I was expected to have it then and there.</span></p> <p><span>Or perhaps the realization hit during my first few lunches at the dining hall. After navigating the schizophrenia of the noon Annenberg rush, I would invariably find myself seated in some table full of exceptionally well-groomed fellow freshmen who were excitedly charting out the course of their entire Harvard careers down to the month.</span></p> <p><span>The realization was that Harvard is something of an unending interrogation. Our experience on campus is, in many ways, defined by a single question: \"What do you believe?\" It is an inescapable question, one that is asked and re-asked in a seemingly endless number of ways. It\u2019s asked to us in class, at the student activities fair, and amidst the post-presidential debate chatter in a common room.</span></p> <p><span>I am thankful that I am constantly asked this question. That was, after all, why I chose to come to Harvard: to try to challenge my view of who I was and what I believed. However, as I sat in that government section or around an Annenberg table, watching my peers eloquently offer jargon-riddled defenses of American economic dominance and detailed breakdowns of their career plans, I learned that simply asking the question wasn\u2019t enough. Like with all things at Harvard, you have to know the answer.</span></p> <p><span>When it comes to our beliefs, it often seems that the worst imaginable opinion is not an unpopular one but rather having none at all. Any indecision or wavering is chalked up to ignorance or intellectual cowardice. To me, this was a source of terror. As Ted Gup once put it in an <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4837776\">NPR essay</a>, I had a tendency \u201cto stand in the no-man's land between opposing arguments, yearning to be won over by one side or the other, but finding instead degrees of merit in both.\u201d But at Harvard, it seemed I had no choice: I had to pretend that I knew where I fell on every single issue, big or small.</span></p> <p><span>Of course, this is hardly limited to life at Harvard. Ours is an era of hashtag debates and Snapchat politics, tantrums, and Trump campaigns. It\u2019s an age where our very sense of individuality rests upon our ability to concisely and emphatically express our identity and beliefs, to constantly advertise what separates us from the horrifying faceless mass that is \u201ceveryone else.\u201d In an age where having an opinion defines the way we live, we equate wavering with stupidity or spinelessness.</span></p> <p><span>There is certainly nothing wrong with having a firm, well-grounded opinion. It is also necessary, however, to recognize the importance of weighing conflicting opinions, the value in struggling to find a firm answer. To assume that lack of an opinion implies laziness or thoughtlessness is to ignore the fact that many of the most important dilemmas we face today are far more complex than they may initially appear.</span></p> <p><span>It may seem self-defeating to write an opinion piece in defense of not having an opinion, but at a time when political polarization is at a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/04/23/a-stunning-visualization-of-our-divided-congress/\">historic peak</a> and cultural rifts seem more apparent than ever, the courage to see the nuanced, messy middle ground is just as needed as the courage to take a firm ideological stance.</span></p> <p><span>While at Harvard, the appearance of self-assuredness in our beliefs can at times feel all important. Ultimately, however, an obsession with finding definite answers on every issue may lead to stagnation as opposed to discovery. Perhaps what we need more than ever is the courage to not have an answer.</span></p> <p><span><br><em>Joon Lee \u201820, a Crimson editorial comper, lives in Canaday Hall</em></span></p>"}

They imagine that non-Harvard  women will be readily impressed by their Harvard credentials and also less likely to report them for sexual assault. They exchange tips and tricks for picking up women.

In 2012, Republican nominee Mitt Romney (a man with not one, but two, degrees from this august institution) barely <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/5/22/senior-survey-commencement-naveen/\">cleared the double digits</a> among students, and this year, <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/2/10/faculty-donate-clinton-2016/\">91% of faculty donations</a> were bound for the Clinton camp.</span></p> <p><span>Of course, ideological diversity gets endorsements in the <a href=\"http://www.harvard.edu/president\">occasional convocation address</a> by President Drew G. Faust\u2014and from the Republican Club and a few right-wing professors. But, on the whole, inertia and apathy rule the day.</span></p> <p><span>This has always frustrated me, because I believe that a more diverse set of views makes for better debate, richer discussion, and wider outlooks. To be sure, this is painting in broad strokes, but I can\u2019t help but think that section in my government courses would be more dynamic if half of the country were more vocally represented. Let me put it another way: The folks who Dean Khurana loves to say are the citizen-leaders of tomorrow often appear to only be looking to lead those citizens from blue states.</span></p> <p><span>Traditionally, the university resolves these issues by adding a tablespoon of Republicans and stirring. Witness the IOP fellows, where invariably two or three of the six are the token conservatives. Indeed, ideological diversity is often equated with bi- or non-partisanship. It\u2019s why the temporary decamping of IOP Director Maggie Williams to Hillary HQ in Brooklyn has some conservative alumni <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/8/25/williams-alumni-letter-iop/\">up in arms</a>.</span></p> <p><span>I could imagine a 2012 version of myself being worked up about those sort of dust-ups. That was before <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ab9AnZaLL1U\">the Donald stepped onto that escalator</a>\u2014and upended my conception of ideological diversity.</span></p> <p><span>In the long, gold-plated list of things to deplore about Donald Trump, the cognitive dissonance he gives me is a pretty minor footnote. Nevertheless, put simply: I don\u2019t know where my policy preferences stop and my principles start.</span></p> <p><span>I\u2019ve sadly found my commitment to ideological diversity fraying. I don\u2019t think my politics have changed, and neither have my arguments for why Harvard needs a loyal opposition. But once mine eyes had seen the coming of the Trump, there was no going back.</span></p> <p><span>Usually, in our firmly entrenched two party system, if I merely dislike the name next to \u201cRepublican\u201d on the ballot, my instinctive response is have a lively debate and then cross the aisle. When that name is anathema, and for bigotry and ignorance no less, I simply have no wish to hear the apologists.</span></p> <p><span>For a while, I wondered if that was intellectual cowardice, a desire to curl up in a Fox-free zone. (Dare I say safe space?) Some are anxious to seek out the \u201ctrue\u201d conservatives as sparring partners, but this too is an exercise in intellectual half-truths. The base voted for the elephant in the room, and it is orange. Sure, he may be a bigot, but is there not some threshold of support and respectability and mainstream-ness \u2013 he is the nominee of one of this country\u2019s two major parties, after all \u2013 that he has earned? And are universities not places where ideas can be freely debated?</span></p> <p><span>Let me be clear: I think anyone, including Harvard students, has the right to speak in Trump\u2019s defense. Yet the outer bound of the legally possible ought not to be the limits of the desirable. Especially in an academic environment, it is not censorship to tell racism to get lost any more than it was when <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/08/25/hillary-clintons-alt-right-speech-annotate\">Bob Dole, George W. Bush, or John McCain</a> did it.</span></p> <p><span>Therein lies the difference between this election year and every other: The Republican nominee\u2019s proposals are so fringe, so offensive, so misguided, and so un-American that their inclusion serves only to push the conversation towards what a recent article in <a href=\"http://www.cjr.org/analysis/trump_inspires_murrow_moment_for_journalism.php\">the Columbia Journalism Review</a> called \u201cdeviance.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Trump\u2019s danger is that he drags the deviant into the arena of legitimate controversy. When budget policy and the President\u2019s birth certificate can share a stage, the merger of the fringe and the mainstream is complete, thoroughly complicating any attempt to argue for political balance in an academic discussion. I can keep wishing for more ideological diversity at Harvard, but it\u2019s an impossible ask when separating conspiracy theorists from the \u201ctrue\u201d Republicans requires a fine-toothed comb and a pair of tweezers.</span></p> <p><span>For me, this isn\u2019t an election to count the number of Ds and Rs on the faculty. It\u2019s an election to be counted, to stand up in favor of principles held even more deeply than any musings on partisan balance. If a commitment to some platonic ideal of ideological diversity requires putting Donald Trump next to Hillary Clinton, treating him like an ordinary conservative, and asking ourselves with a straight face whose tax plan we\u2019d prefer, count me out.</span></p> <p><span><br></span></p> <p><span><em>Derek K.

{"title": "Artist Spotlight: Tyler S. Parker   | Arts | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Hanaa J. Masalmeh", "body": "<p><span>\u201cThe Flag,\u201d a documentary by Tyler S. Parker \u201917, explores the debate over the Confederate flag in the wake of the Charleston shootings. The short film focuses on the protests, both pro- and anti-flag, that took place in the South Carolina state capitol in the summer of 2015 and that eventually resulted in the flag\u2019s removal. Parker\u2019s documentary won several awards at the Harvard College Film Festival and will also be showing at the Arlington and New Orleans Film Festivals. The Crimson sat down with Parker to discuss his work.</span></p> <p><span>The Harvard Crimson: Where did you find the inspiration for \u201cThe Flag\u201d?</span></p> <p><span>Tyler S. Parker: I went to South Carolina [in the summer of 2015] to work for the Hillary Clinton campaign, and while I was there, there were the shootings at the Emmanuel AME Church. I\u2019m a pretty strong Christian, and I\u2019ve been to lots of black churches back home, and that was something that really moved me. The grace that the family showed to the killer was really powerful. I kept watching that situation in case there was an opportunity for a documentary. A couple of weeks later, one of the state senators, Clementa Pinckney, [who was murdered in the shooting] was lying in state in the state capitol building, and there was a Confederate flag that was flying outside. All the flags in the state capitol were half-staff except the Confederate flag. A lot of people were outraged. My office was two blocks from the the front of the state capitol building, so when I could get free time from the campaign I grabbed my camera and did as much recording as I could. \u201cThe Flag\u201d turned out to be a really fascinating piece of work about people arguing with each other outside the state capitol building. \u201cDemocracy at its rawest\u201d is how I describe the film.</span></p> <p><span>THC: You titled the documentary \u201cThe Flag\u201d as if it\u2019s a taboo thing that is both instantly recognizable but impossible to talk about directly. And of course, there\u2019s a big conversation on campus about symbols, such as the names on Harvard buildings and the vandalized images at the Harvard Law School. When you created this documentary, which is at its heart about symbols, what were you hoping to explore\u2014either through the flag or about the flag?</span></p> <p><span>TSP: The topic of racist iconography is inevitably there, and it was really interesting to go into the South and watch a lot of people celebrate the fall of the Confederate flag, but people outside of South Carolina\u2014especially people here at Harvard who may come from places like California or the Northeast\u2014[were] confused about why this was even a question. I also think that there is a real distance between the experiences of a lot of African-Americans and other people of color who live in places of entrenched racism like the South, or people who may be used to less overt forms of racism such as microaggressions or systemic racism. [For example,] I have family that live in Stone Mountain, Georgia. The mountain that is called Stone Mountain has a big Mount Rushmore-style murals [of] Confederate generals. There are many issues that black people in the South have learned to tolerate, whereas African-Americans in the North are not used to these experiences. Ultimately, the fight to have the Confederate flag removed has been a tremendously uphill battle, and I think that if the shootings hadn\u2019t happened the way they did with a white supremacist responsible, we would still be seeing the Confederate flag in South Carolina\u2019s state capitol.</span></p> <p><span>THC: In this documentary you make sure to use very close personal shots, zooming in on the faces of protesters from both sides. What was the purpose of this technique, and what are some other artistic choices that you made to get your message across?</span></p> <p><span>TSP: When I first started filming, I thought I could make a film that was a really straightforward \u201ctake down the flag\u201d film. But then I wanted to make something more journalistic and even-handed. There\u2019s a scene in a film there\u2019s a girl who\u2019s crying because one of the anti-flag protesters called her a pig, and that happened on the first day I shot, and it was something that stuck in my mind during the entire process of shooting. I wanted to capture more of that emotion because I think that in difficult conversations it\u2019s so easy to forget that every human being, no matter what side of the issue they are on, has a story, and has reasons that, if not objectively reasonable, are subjectively reasonable [and] are informed by their life experiences, by the opinions and stories that they have been told. I was really conscious to make sure to allot both sides equal amounts of time in the film. I really tried to focus on close-ups because there is something about seeing someone\u2019s eyes as they are giving an impassioned speech that can tell you more about what they are saying than their words. I also didn\u2019t want to use music. I really wanted to use the sounds of the space that I was shooting in, since the story and people\u2019s reactions are enough to create a world. I wanted the people in the film to tell the story and to take myself out of it as much as possible.</span></p> <p><span>THC: Do you think that we as a country need to work toward racial equality? Or do you think that the time for a national conversation is over and that we need to abandon the debate in order to begin tangible work on this issue?</span></p> <p><span>TSP: Nikki Haley [governor of South Carolina] came and gave a speech at Harvard saying that after the shootings people came together and had conversation peacefully, and eventually came to the conclusion to take the flag down. There are two opposing world views about how to solve social problems in United States: One is to do something; the other is to have a conversation and convince people that something needs to be done. At the end of the day, all that matters is that something was done about the flag. I think that [in many historical cases] people were doing stuff, and then hearts and minds will follow.</span></p> <p><span><br>\u2014Staff writer Hanaa J.

Ulrich, brandishing the\r\ncurved yellow fruit that sits in front of her.\r\n\u201cWhat is the meaning of a squash?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The squash is one part of a quotidian\r\nensemble laid out on the table at the first meeting\r\nof Ulrich\u2019s history seminar titled \u201cThis Old\r\nHouse.\u201d It sits in the company of an axe, a miniature\r\nreplica of the John Harvard statue, a\r\nthree-footed cooking pot, several ears of corn,\r\nred Solo cups, and a kitschy teapot designed\r\nto resemble a pineapple\u2014relics of everyday\r\nAmerican life, throughout the ages.</span></p> <p><span>Ulrich, a celebrated scholar of early American\r\nhistory, often grounds her research in the\r\nmundane, examining broad social dynamics\r\nthrough the lens of everyday life. In her most\r\nfamous book, the Pulitzer-winning \u201cMidwife\u2019s\r\nTale,\u201d Ulrich constructs a coherent vision of\r\n18th century marriage customs, crime rates,\r\nand medical practices from the details of an\r\nordinary midwife\u2019s diary.</span></p> <p><span>Although much of Ulrich\u2019s scholarship\r\nfocuses on New England, her own origins lie\r\nin small-town Idaho. When I ask her about her\r\nupbringing, I make the mistake of locating her\r\nhome state in the Midwest, and she is quick to\r\ncorrect me.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIowa is in the Midwest, but Idaho is in the\r\nRocky Mountains,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s my pet\r\npeeve\u2014and it\u2019s really common.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>When Ulrich was growing up, Sugar City,\r\nIdaho was home to about 990 inhabitants,\r\nunnamed roads, and a few stores. She graduated\r\nhigh school in a class of 56, made up of\r\n\u201ctown kids and farm kids\u201d alike. By the time\r\nUlrich delivered the valedictory address at the\r\nUniversity of Utah in 1960, she had been married\r\nfor nearly two years. When she finished\r\nher doctorate at the University of New Hampshire\r\nin 1980, she and her husband had raised\r\nfive children.</span></p> <p><span>Ulrich is a longtime scholar of women\u2019s history\r\nand a self-professed feminist. Now, for the\r\nfirst time, she is writing and teaching about\r\nthe intersection of feminism and another crucial\r\npart of her identity: her Mormon faith. In\r\nher newest book, \u201cA House Full of Females,\u201d\r\nUlrich examines Mormon plural marriage and\r\nEuropean encounters with other family structures.</span></p> <p><span>Ulrich\u2019s current research echoes some of\r\nher early academic endeavors: In the 1970s,\r\nshe and a colleague discovered copies of the\r\n19th-century women\u2019s newspaper Woman\u2019s\r\nExponent in Widener Library. The newspaper,\r\nwritten for Mormon women, promoted\r\nwomen\u2019s suffrage and equal rights. This finding\r\ncame at a time when women\u2019s history was\r\nstill a budding field.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere wasn\u2019t any feminism when I was\r\ngrowing up, the term really came back into\r\ncurrency in the 1960s and 1970s,\u201d she explains.\r\n\u201cI had the excitement of pioneering women\u2019s\r\nhistory.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cExcitement\u201d is perhaps Ulrich\u2019s most distinct\r\ncharacteristic as a professor. The yellow\r\nsquash is meaningful because it is indigenous\r\nto the Americas, she says, eyes widening.\r\nDescribing the seminar\u2019s upcoming field trips\r\nto the Harvard Forest and the 18th-century\r\nArtemas Ward house as \u201cabsolute serendipity,\u201d\r\nUlrich can hardly contain her enthusiasm for\r\nold shoes and cellar holes.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe are going to have so much fun,\u201d Ulrich\r\npromises the class. She jokes that she sounds\r\nlike Republican presidential nominee Donald\r\nTrump. \u201cBut it\u2019s okay to be enthusiastic if you\r\nhave the facts with you.\u201d</span></p>"}

{"title": "The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Bundled against the record-breaking cold, a group of students gathered in Harvard Yard for an unconventional class project in March of 2015. They recited poetry and prose, and placed \u201csacred bundles,\u201d small burlap bags filled with ephemera, on trees. Turning more than a few heads, the students, members of \u201cSpanish 126: Performing Latinidad\u201d, placed a cardboard cut-out of Jennifer Lopez across from the iconic John Harvard statue.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThat is my favorite class to teach at Harvard,\u201d Lorgia H.

Before becoming a professor at Harvard, Garc\u00eda Pe\u00f1a taught at the University of Georgia. In 2003, when Georgia\u2019s board of regents passed a ban on undocumented college students, Garc\u00eda Pe\u00f1a\u2014herself a first-generation college student with undocumented family members\u2014took matters into her own hands.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cSeeing the pain that my students were experiencing... We decided to create a separate space,\u201d  she says. Along with a handful of professors intent on protesting the ban, Garc\u00eda Pe\u00f1a co-founded Freedom University, a \u201cmodern-day freedom school\u201d aimed at giving a space and voice to students affected by the ban. Now in its fifth year, the program is continuing to expand.</span></p> <p><span>Back at Harvard, students file into Sever Hall for the second session of \"Performing Latinidad\" this semester. Walking among the rows in the mostly-full lecture hall, Garc\u00eda Pe\u00f1a transitions effortlessly between describing her own Dominican heritage and childhood in New Jersey, and issues taking place on a global and historic scale. It\u2019s just the beginning, but Garc\u00eda Pe\u00f1a has lofty goals for the semester.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhat I\u2019m hoping is that people can reflect critically about where we are as a  world, as a society and as humans,\u201d Garc\u00eda Pe\u00f1a says of the weeks and work ahead. \u201cHow do we look at this intersectionally, how do we look at this transnationally?

Clinton come election day.</span></p> <p><span>At least at Harvard, the answer appears to be yes.</span></p> <p><span>Sanders supporters on campus are rallying behind Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee and former Secretary of State, though with the caveat that some feel less enthusiastic about the nominee.</span></p> <p><span>The so-called \u201cBernie or Bust\u201d movement, that had a demonstrable presence at this summer\u2019s Democratic National Convention, is not visible on Harvard\u2019s campus. Justin G. Curtis \u201919, vice president of the former Harvard Students United for Bernie student group, said all of the former members of his organization with whom he has recently spoken recently plan to vote for Clinton.</span></p> <p><span><span class=\"redactor-invisible-space\"></span></span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhen we were canvassing in New Hampshire for the primaries, we were canvassing for Bernie and they were canvassing for Hillary. It was a very amiable relationship,\u201d he said, referring to a <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/2/8/democrats-canvass-new-hampshire/\">Harvard Democrats trip</a> last semester. \u201cThey stand for many of the same things, so I think there should be a pretty natural transfer of support.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Compared to other university campuses across the country, Curtis said he believes Harvard students have more readily accepted Clinton\u2019s nomination, and himself called the DNC Bernie or Bust parades \u201cquite frankly ridiculous.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Several members of the Harvard Democrats, including board members, who previously canvassed and phone-banked for Sanders have offered their help to the Clinton campaign, Harvard Democrats President Susan X. Wang \u201917 said. Wang added that she hopes to improve outreach efforts to former Sanders supporters across campus in the coming weeks as well, with canvassing trips to New Hampshire and phone-banking into Nevada and Pennsylvania planned for the near future.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe are really trying to make sure to reach out to the people who were actively campaigning for Bernie and trying to get them involved with our canvassing activities,\u201d she said. \u201cWe realize that at the end of the day we\u2019re all Democrats and unfortunately the way the election has played out, if it\u2019s not Hillary Clinton, it\u2019s going to be Donald Trump.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>He Li \u201916-17, who served as president of the former Harvard students for Sanders group, said everyone he has spoken to has decided to rally behind Clinton, though many were initially \u201cdisenchanted,\u201d himself included, with her candidacy. Li said several former members of his organization are working for Clinton over the next few months running up to the election.</span></p> <p><span>Both Li and Curtis attributed the successful transfer of support from Sanders to Clinton among their membership to Clinton\u2019s adoption of elements of Sanders\u2019s platform.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI preferred Sanders to Hillary mostly because of his stance on campaign finance reform, and a lot of what he said actually has worked its way into Clinton\u2019s program calling for a constitutional amendment to repeal Citizens United,\u201d Curtis said, referring to a Supreme Court ruling that made it easier for corporations to make political donations. \u201cSo I think that a lot of that ideological carry over has influenced a lot of my peers to support Secretary Clinton.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Kabir K.

{"title": "\u200bWhat the Hell Do You Have to Lose? | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Hold onto your hats, because I\u2019m starting this column with a bombshell.<br></span></p> <p><span>Donald Trump is not connecting with black Americans.</span></p> <p><span>Now, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. After all, this is a man who has a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/04/donald-trump-i-have-a-great-relationship-with-the-blacks/237332/\">great relationship with the blacks</a>\u201d and would be reelected with \u201c<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/donald-trump-african-american-vote-227218\">95 percent of the black vote</a>.\u201d In fact, Rudy Giuliani <a href=\"https://twitter.com/oliverdarcy/status/771868671924903936\">argues</a> he might outperform every modern Republican in the demographic. (That one\u2019s technically true, as Nate Cohn <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nate_Cohn/status/771870977688997888\">notes</a>, because the election hasn\u2019t happened yet.)</span></p> <p><span>You already know where I\u2019m going with this. In the non-Trumpian reality, for whatever it\u2019s worth, Trump is polling very poorly among black Americans. By <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-is-in-fourth-place-among-black-voters/\">FiveThirtyEight\u2019s count</a> last month, he\u2019s in fourth place. His recent appeals to the demographic have prompted offense and scorn, and deservedly: <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/08/trumps-perplexing-play-for-black-voters/496991/\">Trump is giving these speeches</a> to overwhelmingly white audiences while doubling down on dog-whistle politics. And even an uncharacteristically pitch-perfect entreaty would only work if blacks forgot Trump\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/18/opinion/why-blacks-loathe-trump.html?_r=1\">career-long history</a> of discrimination towards blacks and winking sympathy towards white nationalists.</span></p> <p><span>So the pivot probably won\u2019t work. (Sorry, Rudy.) But a phrase at the heart of Trump\u2019s message to black voters\u2014and the reaction to it\u2014reveals a fascinating insight about how we think about politics. After rattling off a list of Black America\u2019s problems, Trump asks, \u201cWhat the hell do you have to lose?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>This is essentially the same pitch Trump makes to whites. Trump embraces, even exaggerates, how wildly different he is from other politicians. Since <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/congressional_job_approval-903.html\">we all hate them so much</a> (the thinking goes), why not give an outsider a chance? This idea won Trump a plurality of the Republican primary vote. It\u2019s actually <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/interactive/2016/08/31/fox-news-poll-aug-31-2016/\">winning him</a> a plurality of white voters in the general election, too. If Trump weren\u2019t, well, Trump\u2014that is, if another candidate, without his numerous racial miscues, tried this \u201cWhy not?\u201d strategy\u2014would it work with blacks?</span></p> <p><span>I don\u2019t think so, because of a psychological concept called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_aversion_(psychology)#Prospect_theory_and_gain-loss_asymmetry_.28S-shaped_value_function.29\">gain-loss asymmetry</a>. When we feel we\u2019ve gained something, we\u2019re reluctant to gamble it away; when we feel we\u2019ve lost something, we\u2019re willing to risk a considerable amount to get it back.</span></p> <p><span>Black Americans are <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/doc/270133740/The-American-Dream?secret_password=1Rj95jqAHMgw9Cddc7Jq\">far more optimistic</a> about the country\u2019s trajectory than whites. Black voters over 65, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/06/10/upshot/voting-habits.html\">who vote more than anyone else</a>, are old enough to remember times before the Civil Rights Act, Voting Rights Act, and Fair Housing Act (the latter of which gave Trump his <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/inside-the-governments-racial-bias-case-against-donald-trumps-company-and-how-he-fought-it/2016/01/23/fb90163e-bfbe-11e5-bcda-62a36b394160_story.html\">first brush with infamy</a>). The rest at least remember a time when all American presidents had been white. Many will hear Trump\u2019s question, think of the incremental-change model <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/05/23/president-obama-speaks-his-mind\">beloved by President Obama</a>\u2014to whom they give an <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/121199/obama-weekly-job-approval-demographic-groups.aspx\">approval rating in the 90s</a>\u2014and answer, \u201cEverything.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The white working class, though, feels that they\u2019ve lost, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4OaicWAw4M\">bigly</a>.\u201d Facing stagnant wages, decreasing lifespans, and shrinking political clout, they\u2019ve largely grown pessimistic about the future, and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/22/us/politics/donald-trump-rnc-speech.html\">Trump\u2019s bleak take on the nation\u2019s future</a> matches their own. Maybe Trump\u2019s message resonates with these voters because they see their livelihoods drifting away and are willing to roll the dice to get them back.</span></p> <p><span>The gain-loss asymmetry framework helps explain how Trump fares among other demographics. Bisexual, gay, and lesbian Americans, who in their lifetimes have witnessed a stunning reversal of public opinion and equal treatment under the law, have especially good reason to distrust a candidate whose very slogan promises a return to the past. Sure enough, a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2016/05/WINS-Findings-Among-LGBT-Voters-May-2016.pdf\">poll released in May</a> found that BGLT voters preferred Clinton to Trump by an even greater margin than they preferred their 2012 counterparts, even though Trump\u2019s rhetoric on <a href=\"http://www.ontheissues.org/2016/Donald_Trump_Civil_Rights.htm\">same-sex marriage</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/04/21/donald-trump-says-transgender-people-should-use-the-bathroom-they-want/\">gender-neutral bathrooms</a> are to the left of <a href=\"http://www.ontheissues.org/2016/Mitt_Romney_Civil_Rights.htm#Gay_Rights\">Romney\u2019s</a>.</span></p> <p><span>The same framework also helps us reckon with Trump\u2019s success. He presents himself as a wild card, a long-shot solution to revitalizing the American Dream. I imagine that a large number of third-party voters and even of Trump\u2019s supporters think, \u201cSure, this guy could turn out to be a real disaster, but he couldn\u2019t be worse than what we have.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Such thinking, though, betrays a lack of imagination. Donald Trump could definitely be worse than what we have\u2014or what we\u2019ve ever had. That Trump is <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/11/politics/hillary-clinton-health-2016-election/\">a stumble away</a> from the presidency represents a failure on the part of the Republican Party and the horse-race-obsessed, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/11/public-editor/the-truth-about-false-balance.html?_r=0\">false-equivalence-prone</a> media. Whomever you consider to be the most destructive president in our history\u2014W., Carter, Obama, whoever you\u2019d like\u2014still, inarguably, had guardrails to prevent him from doing anything truly cataclysmic. But those guardrails, like <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/7/28/12281222/trump-clinton-conventions\">normal</a> dispositions, mostly competent advisors, and a willingness to rule out first use of nuclear weapons, are not intrinsic to the office. A President Trump could, for example, launch nuclear weapons, still the most serious (and most strangely overlooked) threat to humanity, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/06/2016-donald-trump-nuclear-weapons-missiles-nukes-button-launch-foreign-policy-213955\">with little deliberation</a>.</span></p> <p><span>Risk is thrilling. If you feel like our country\u2019s not as great as it used to be, you might feel like taking a gamble. But America risks throwing away a whole lot more than a few bucks at a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Taj_Mahal\">failing Atlantic City casino</a>.</span></p> <p><span><br></span></p> <p><span><em>Trevor J.

{"title": "Stop Rubbernecking Through the 2016 Election | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Rubbernecking: the act of slowing down in a moment of morbid curiosity or harmless fascination. The phrase was originally coined in the early 20th century to refer to tourists who slow down the normal pace of things because of their fascination with a new environment (looking at you, John Harvard statute tourists). Synonyms include: curiosity delay, gaper delay, gawk block, and Lookie Lou.<br></span></p> <p><span>We\u2019ve all been there. An accident on the side of the road causes traffic delays, a four-lane highway is bottlenecked, and cars and trucks have to merge left to avoid the three-car pile up surrounded by law enforcement and emergency responders. Onlookers resolute to identify the cause of the accident (and figure out what precisely caused their 40 minute delay) exacerbate the already slow moving traffic. Is anyone hurt? Whose fault is it? How bad do the cars look?</span></p> <p><span>At a fundamental level, rubbernecking is part of human nature. There is a body of scientific <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2014/10/08/science_explains_why_we_cant_look_away_from_a_car_wreck_and_other_disturbing_events/\">evidence</a> suggesting that the physiological reaction we have to being scared or repulsed is similar to the reaction we have when we\u2019re excited. When we slow down to observe a wreck, we do so because we find the wreck fascinating and our behavior easy to justify: Everyone else has slowed down to pay attention to the wreck; I guess I should take a look too.</span></p> <p><span>But unfortunately, rubbernecking is likely to cause more accidents and slowdowns. According to a 2013 <a href=\"http://file.scirp.org/pdf/JTTs_2014012613374086.pdf\">study</a>, rubbernecking caused by vehicle crashes and other incidents accounted for 16 percent of all vehicle crashes, amounting to more congestion and more accidents.</span></p> <p><span>The good, and bad, news about rubbernecking is that it\u2019s entirely in control of the onlookers. Fellow drivers can choose to slow down as the car in front of them does, but they can also choose to keep driving at a normal pace.</span></p> <p><span>Which brings me to my point, and my plea: Please do not rubberneck your way through the 2016 election.</span></p> <p><span>It\u2019s tempting. When Hillary Clinton \u201c<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/10/politics/hillary-clinton-dance-ellen-degeneres/\">whips and nae naes</a>\u201d on the Ellen Show, or Donald Trump seemingly <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/08/02/488395073/trump-kicks-baby-out-of-rally\">removes a baby</a> from his rally, it can be hard not to succumb to the click bait and revel in the absolute absurdity that is the 2016 presidential election.</span></p> <p><span>But the consequences of focusing on the unimportant can be drastic. An <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/upshot/measuring-donald-trumps-mammoth-advantage-in-free-media.html?_r=0\">analysis</a> featured by the New York Times attempted to track the amount of airtime, understood succinctly as earned or \u201cfree\u201d media, each candidate received throughout the primary election. Whether or not that media attention was truly \u201cearned\u201d is a debate for another time, but I\u2019d argue the massively disproportionate coverage of some candidates over others is in part a product of political rubbernecking.</span></p> <p><span>Each outrageous statement made (or tweeted) by Donald Trump has perpetuated his coverage. Each new \u201cTrump gaffe\u201d (which somehow never gives rise to any of the political symptoms usually associated with a gaffe, like a drop in the polls) just drives more media attention his way. And the more that rubbernecking drives attention toward Donald Trump, the more that Hillary Clinton is able to skimp on her own exposure in the media. Secretary Clinton avoided giving a press conference for <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/hillary-clinton-press-russia-putin-227748\">275</a> days until breaking her streak last week.</span></p> <p><span>While the press has been repeating awkward incidents by candidates to fulfill the public\u2019s appetite and focusing on the competitive, \u201cwho is up and who is down\u201d nature of campaigns, substance has fallen to the wayside. In a <a href=\"http://shorensteincenter.org/news-coverage-2016-presidential-primaries/\">study</a> conducted about the 2016 presidential primaries by the Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s Shorenstein Center, it was determined that only a paltry 11 percent of all primary coverage focused on a candidate\u2019s policy positions, leadership ability, or personal and professional history.</span></p> <p><span>Political rubbernecking is not new to media coverage, but it definitely seems intensified this time around. I don\u2019t argue that every outrageous and seemingly irrelevant statement (or tweet) made by presidential contenders should be ignored. But I do know that the press reports on what the public reads, and there is a serious need to press both candidates on their respective policy positions.</span></p> <p><span>A recent <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/urn:publicid:ap.org:428681f59b0c40e9af1f973dd30bc1ca\">evaluation</a> of both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump\u2019s campaign websites reveals exactly how much substantive policy is (or isn\u2019t) being addressed: the Clinton site details a total of 112,735 words dedicated to 38 policy issues, and the Trump site lists a total of seven policy issues amounting to just over 9,000 words.</span></p> <p><span>This discrepancy feels strange. As a country, we have to consider what factors should be most central to our decision to elect a new president, and in turn we need to hold our nominees responsible for delivering relevant information. As we get closer to Election Day, let\u2019s start having real conversations. Or at least stop rubbernecking the sillier ones.</span></p> <p><span><em><br></em></span></p> <p><span><em>Caroline M.

Nabokov\u2019s writing reveals how utterly meaningless the term \u201coriginal\u201d is\u2014every work of art relies on the one preceding it, either as inspiration or antithesis. While this creative genealogy is essential, it has often been maligned, as \u201cinspired by\u201d and \u201cbased on\u201d are increasingly interpreted as \u201cknock-off.\u201d Nowhere is this more evident that in Hollywood, where the recent surge of remakes has caused critics to lament the death of a medium. As is often the case, however, the implications are much more complicated.</span></p> <p><span>Hollywood is a cultural behemoth, and while its vast capital allows it to create lavish blockbuster hits, it is also difficult for a giant to follow with the delicate two-step that is today\u2019s culture. The #OscarsSoWhite boycott is one such example. While a lack of racial diversity begins long before award shows, with allegedly unfair hiring practices and a dearth of minority writers, the controversy soon centered on the Oscars. It quickly became clear that change does not come quickly to such a large cultural institution. The blockbuster business model, in which studios focus on a handful of big-budget films, necessitates tried and true formulas; if one film fails, the entire studio goes down with it. For this reason, Hollywood tends to rely on the safety and cultural capital of memory, and even when women or minorities are cast in leading roles\u2014a \u201crisky\u201d move\u2014they are cast into films like \u201cGhostbusters\u201d and \u201cStar Wars,\u201d the fame of which ensures that audiences will flock to see them no matter what.</span></p> <p><span>Disney is a prime example of the remake market, and it has been outspoken about its plans to create a steady stream of remakes until 2019. Is Disney simply out of ideas? Or is there another reason for the lavish barrage of remakes? Once again, the answer lies in the business model: A film has essentially a single shot at success, one that can either end spectacularly or disastrously. Once the verdict is out on social media, there is little chance for the film to redeem itself. Television, on the other hand, is much more flexible; when Donald Trump began his run for president, \u201cScandal\u201d was quick to create an analogous character, and then take him down, fulfilling the fantasies of their liberal audience. \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d one of the most successful TV shows of all time, relies on tantalizing its audiences to create buzz. Whereas film is the one-night stand of media, a TV show is a long term-relationship, in which both parties are equally invested. This type of investment is primed to take advantage of social media, in which endless memes, fan theories, and recaps generate cultural momentum for TV shows, often resulting in a snowball effect in which the number of viewers increases between seasons. Films, however, don\u2019t work this way, because someone who has not seen the first film is unlikely to see the sequel.</span></p> <p><span>It is for this reason that Hollywood panders to topical appeal, as opposed to plot appeal. While the trillions of superhero film remakes are a mishmash of sequels, prequels, and reboots, they are never marketed this way; instead, they are treated as a \u201cnew version\u201d of events, ones that require no familiarity with the previous film but rather only a familiarity with characters. It is for this reason that Disney\u2019s reboots are so successful: They draw upon a certain nostalgia, as well as a guarantee that their middle-class, value-seeking audiences will get the most of their money. Many film critics lament this fact, alleging that this \u201cpandering to the masses\u201d will cause a decline of the film medium.</span></p> <p><span>This \u201cproblem\u201d is nothing new. In the middle of the 19th century, German critics lamented the fact that their avant-garde music was misunderstood by the masses, who allegedly preferred classic formulas to the pioneering work of \u201ctrue\u201d musicians. These artists failed to grasp the idea that a medium can exist on multiple levels, from the plebeian to the profound; the existence of \u201ccommon\u201d music does not preclude the existence of \u201ctrue art.\u201d Furthermore, what is often seen as a destructive influence in one era is hailed as an innovation in another; history is replete with examples of artists who failed to find fame in their own eras, only to become astoundingly well-known after their deaths. While the artists\u2019 work itself remained unchanged, the way in which audiences interpreted this art slowly shifted.</span></p> <p><span>Viewed from this lens, the medium of Hollywood is arguably the purest or the most sordid form of art, depending on how one views audience opinions. Unlike niche-art, which often serves the artist\u2019s sensibilities more than the audience\u2019s, big-box Hollywood cinema is not shielded from the power of its viewers. It is precisely this audience that has allowed the remake industry to continue; if audiences wouldn\u2019t pay to see these films, it would make no sense to continue to make them. And while it might be true that many Hollywood films today are formulaic, one must also consider the fact that recreations and remakes have long been part of the history of film. \u201cScarface\u201d is one such example\u2014a remake that went on to become a hallowed classic.</span></p> <p><span>While the financial aspects of cinema causes many studios to cement themselves into reliable money-making formulas, this should come as a surprise to no one who refers to the film \u201cindustry.\u201d Cultural production is a business like any other, and the remake strategy has been a veritable gold mine. Despite our so-called desire to explore the future, nostalgia and past memories retain a strong pull. It is this appeal that Nabokov understood so strongly: The human mind will always be drawn to untouched, hallowed memories, a safe space amid the rankling controversy of today. Hollywood allows us to relive the past in a new way\u2014while making a hefty profit all the while.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Hanaa J.

It seems that things would be a heck of a lot more reassuring if the presidency held no consequential power at all. A titular presidency, that would compare in powerlessness and extravagance with the British monarch, would possibly quench Clinton\u2019s thirst of the iron throne, and it would most certainly bestow enough publicity on Trump to compensate for his other insecurities. The hawks would be hearty and the wars could be prevented.</span></p> <p><span>Such a powerless presidency is a far cry from where we stand now, but a discussion on reining the executive power of the American president does merit some attention.</span></p> <p><span>The American presidency has been gradually becoming more unilateral in waging wars. The second World War, the Cold War and the more recent War on Terrorism have greatly empowered the American president to commit the nation to war-path without any authorization from Congress.</span></p> <p><span>President Harry Truman\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/korean-conflict/\"><span class=\"Hyperlink0\">didn</span><span class=\"Hyperlink0\">\u2019</span><span class=\"Hyperlink0\">t think</span></a> that he needed the authorization of Congress to commit American troops to war in Korea. In 1991, President George H.W. Bush didn\u2019t <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/1991-01-13/news/mn-374_1_persian-gulf\"><span class=\"Hyperlink0\">wait</span></a> for congressional approval to commit troops in the Gulf Kuwait. Similarly, President Bill Clinton chose <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/04/peter-king/rep-peter-king-says-bill-clinton-continued-kosovo-/\"><span class=\"Hyperlink0\">not to listen</span></a> to Congress regarding the intervention in Kosovo. In recent years, President Obama <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/08/the-authority-to-declare-war-a-power-barack-obama-does-not-have/279212/\"><span class=\"Hyperlink0\">felt</span></a> that he did not need any authorization from Congress in either the NATO intervention in Libya in 2011 or our action in Syria.</span></p> <p><span>Furthermore, Obama himself was found to be making final decisions on unilaterally authorized drone strikes and targeted killings\u2014all under the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/31/opinion/too-much-power-for-a-president.html?mtrref=undefined&amp;assetType=opinion&amp;_r=0\"><span class=\"Hyperlink0\">shadow</span></a> of the war on terrorism.</span></p> <p><span>The simple truth is that the American presidency has accumulated an enormous amount of raw firepower in it. The ability to authorize drone strikes, launch nuclear missiles, or commit troops is all vested in the presidency, and over the years, the checks on this power by Congress have eroded and been loosened. In his speech on drone policy, President Obama himself acknowledged the potential executive misuse of targeted killings and has called for a greater congressional oversight on drone operations.</span></p> <p><span>It has long been taken for granted that the American president would be morally prudent. Given the choices we have, and Donald Trump in particular, that conventional wisdom has to be let go. At some point in summer, Donald J. Trump <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/poll-donald-trump-up-over-hillary-clinton-nationally/\"><span class=\"Hyperlink0\">commandeered</span></a> the vote of a plurality of the American population. If the election were held that day, Trump could have possibly won. And the presidency, with all its power, would belong to him to fool around.</span></p> <p><span>It has, therefore, become imperative that we revisit the question: how do we prevent or at least minimize the damage done by a potentially reckless, belligerent, and hawkish president?</span></p> <p><span>Democracy has never been free from the threat of demagogues. And this is certainly not the first time\u2014nor the last\u2014that demagogues have held power or have come close to holding it. However, the salient feature of democratic systems is that they prevent unconstitutional usage of power, or dramatic deviations from acceptable policy norms. A robust democracy acknowledges the demagogic threat to the democracy and tries to limit, with constitutional balances and checks, the damage a demagogue could possibly do.<br></span></p> <p><span>Madison <a href=\"http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa51.htm\">wrote</a> in the Federalist Papers, \u201cIf angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary.\u201d Men and women\u2014even the best\u2014are vulnerable to impulses, to biases, to greed and to recklessness. Robust constitutional checks and balances are required to make democratic systems impervious to someone like Donald J. Trump. The reason the prospect of a Trump presidency is frightening is the kind of potentially devastating things he could do with the power vested in the current executive.</span></p> <p><span>The task at hand is to reassert the weakened checks to the power of presidency. A democratic society cannot put its trust in the good faith and moral prudence of its leaders and elected representatives. Democratic systems have to be designed to be impervious from the threats of belligerent demagogues. Though we can never get rid of demagoguery, we can, however, reinforce our state structure to restrain such a demagogue from coming to power or to minimize the potential damage such a demagogue could breed\u2014the first step of which will be to rethink the amount of power vested in the commander-in-chief. As it stands now, I don\u2019t think anyone should have that amount of power. Not Trump, not even Clinton.<br><br><br><em>Pradeep Niroula </em><em>\u2019</em><em>18, is a Crimson editorial writer, lives in Quincy House.</em></span></p>"}

{"title": "It\u2019s Been Said Before | Arts | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>In 1892, after reading a fairytale about devilish wintry sprite Jack Frost, an 11-year-old girl wrote a short story called \u201cThe Frost King.\u201d Upon its publication in the Perkins School for the Blind\u2019s literary magazine, the story was reported to the school\u2019s head. Not long after, the young girl\u2014who happened to be future author and activist Helen Keller\u2014was accused of lifting her story straight from Margaret Canby\u2019s \u201cFrost Fairies.\u201d Luckily, tween Keller was <a href=\"http://wordsdance.com/2015/07/5-literary-plagiarism-cases-some-famous-some-obscure/\">eventually acquitted of the charges</a>.</span></p> <p><span>We are taught from an early age that plagiarism is practically a capital offense, punishable by a zero on an assignment, expulsion from school, and so forth. Today\u2019s world of copyright infringement and copy-paste mentality drills it into our heads that <a href=\"http://tedx.amsterdam/2011/06/close-up-on-culture-copy-paste-culture/\">copying is wrong</a>. Instead, postmodern culture praises the values of authenticity and originality. Innovation and creation require us to be authentic, to be fresh, to come up with ideas no one else has yet considered. These are the new principles that society values and encourages. If copying another person is not outright illegal, it is at the very least disappointing.</span></p> <p><span>Ten years after the Frost King incident, author Mark Twain expressed his frustration about how it was handled <a href=\"http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/05/bulk-of-all-human-utterances-is.html\">in a letter to Keller</a>: \u201cThe kernel, the soul\u2014let us go further and say the substance, the bulk, the actual and valuable material of all human utterance\u2014is plagiarism. For substantially all ideas are second-hand, consciously and unconsciously drawn from a million outside sources\u2026\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Ideas, much like the ocean\u2019s fish supply back at the height of the fishing industry, appear to be limitless. They are abstractions of the mind, neural firings of an inconceivably complex brain. Approximating the number of potential ideas feels comparable to approximating the number of stars in the universe: impossible. Our gut reaction is to push back against Twain\u2019s suggestion that the pool of ideas might be finite. It\u2019s alarming to consider that Twain could be right, that we are in fact doomed to echo our predecessors without any new words to offer. If so compelled, one could even take it a step further into the realm of existentialism: How can we justify our individual existence if we are only mimicking lives that have passed by before us</span></p> <p><span>Ralph Waldo Emerson, after reaching a similar conclusion to Twain\u2019s, took comfort in the fact that originality may have never really existed anyway, saying: \u201cThe originals are not original. There is imitation, model, and suggestion, to the very archangels, if we knew their history.\u201d<br></span></p> <p><span>What is not innate must be learned, and humans learn best through imitation. It\u2019s a smart way of doing things: Leonardo touched a stove and burned his hand? Don\u2019t do as Leonardo does. Leonardo created a mind-blowing painting that has been studied and lauded by art experts around the world for centuries? Do as Leonardo does. In its most innocent form, copying is a compliment. Imitation stems from inspiration\u2014we copy what we like. As such, imitation has worked its way into every facet of our lives, whether it be the visual arts, films, novels, poetry, music, fashion trends, consumer products or even our conversations with other people: Studies show that <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/7931299/Humans-subconsciously-mimic-other-accents-psychologists-claim.html\">we tend to imitate</a> the person who we are speaking with in order to make the interaction more comfortable. When we are born, our brains are stuffed with mirror neurons in order to make living life a little easier. Do as others do. Don\u2019t touch the stove. Paint the Mona Lisa.</span></p> <p><span>And the appropriation marches on. A surprising number (or perhaps not?) of the last century\u2019s brightest and freshest minds have been found guilty at some point or another. T.S. Eliot, renowned poet and Nobel Prize winner, <a href=\"https://www.plagiarismtoday.com/2015/02/10/5-great-people-who-plagiarized/\">was accused of</a> creating a potpourri of other people\u2019s texts and rebranding it as the famous poem \u201cThe Waste Land<em>.</em>\u201d In June, rock legend Led Zeppelin <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/led-zeppelin-prevail-in-stairway-to-heaven-lawsuit-20160623\">was declared not guilty</a> after allegedly stealing the opening of hit \u201cStairway to Heaven\u201d from an instrumental song by singer Randy Wolfe. And this past July, even the scintillatingly original Melania Trump fell into the hole of plagiarism when her convention speech <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/20/us/politics/melania-trump-speech.html?_r=0\">bore striking resemblances</a> to Michelle Obama\u2019s 2008 version.

{"title": "The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><em></em></span></p> <p><span><br></span></p> <p><span><em>Award-winning novelist Ian McEwan has explored complex issues of morality and science, from quantum physics to the contradictions that arise when religious beliefs stand in the way of a life-saving blood transfusion. His new novel is perhaps his boldest yet. McEwan spoke last week at the Harvard Book Store about Nutshell, a modern interpretation of Hamlet narrated by a sardonic, self-aware fetus. </em><em></em></span></p> <p><span>Fifteen Minutes: <span></span>What was your inspiration for \u201cNutshell\u201d\u2019s unconventional narrator?</span></p> <p><span>Ian McEwan: Well, partly sitting with my daughter-in-law when she was heavily pregnant. I became aware of his [the fetus\u2019s] presence in the room, and it lodged a sort of question mark in my mind. And then I guess I really wanted to connect back to my writer self of 40 years ago when I had a lot of crazy and improbable narrators and take a break from researching. I had the sense that it would be playful and fun and break with the laws of physics and biology.</span></p> <p><span>FM: Had you been actively searching for a topic to write about or did it just come to you?</span></p> <p><span>IM: It just came to me, really. I re-read Shakespeare a lot, so that\u2019s always at the back of my mind. It just began, and once I had the concept, I just had fun with it. It was a pleasure to write.</span></p> <p><span><br></span></p> <p><span>FM: When did you develop the idea of basing the premise on Hamlet?</span></p> <p><span>IM: Right from the beginning, it was always intertwined. Who is the most eloquent character ever created in literature and English? Hamlet burst upon the world scene in 1600 or 1601. We\u2019ve probably never had a character so clever, so self-doubting, so specifically a person not representing a virtue or a vice like so many were up until that time.</span></p> <p><span>FM: Many of your other works like \u201cSaturday\u201d and \u201cSolar\u201d have required extensive research. How was \u201cNutshell\u201d different?</span></p> <p><span>IM: It was great not to be talking to experts for once. It was a holiday really. I never had to stir from my desk and could reach into my own thoughts. I enjoy research, and I\u2019ve always made it integral to the process of writing, but this was just a complete departure. I don\u2019t know where it will lead me in the future.</span></p> <p><span>IM: Writing \u201cSaturday,\u201d I shadowed a neurosurgeon for almost two years, whereas writing \u201cSweet Tooth\u201d about the intelligence world, it was really a matter of a great deal of reading and one or two lunches with ex-spies. I can\u2019t draw any comparison between one [of my works] and another.</span></p> <p><span>FM: Your talk at the Harvard Book Store was with Steven Pinker, whose work lies in cognitive psychology and language development, important aspects of \u201cNutshell.\u201d Is this field something you are particularly interested in?</span></p> <p><span>IM: Steve Pinker and I have been on stage before a half-dozen times, if not more. It\u2019s not only about language learning, but also just the whole range of cognitive psychology and his reflections on science as a worldview that have impressed me enormously over the years. He seems to be an intellectual for our times. His sense of what science can do is a totality of how we view the world... My fetus narrator has quite a strong scientific worldview, and some might find confidence with Steve.</span></p> <p><span>FM: On the second page of \u201cNutshell,\u201d the narrator calls itself a \u201cblank slate\u201d that writes upon itself as it grows by the day. \u201cBlank Slate\u201d is the title of one of Pinker\u2019s books.</span></p> <p><span>IM: It\u2019s a little tease in Steve\u2019s direction. \u201cNutshell\u201d is not a scientific treatise. It has abandoned all the laws of biology. But I am sort of raising my hat in Steve\u2019s direction with that blank slate moment.</span></p> <p><span>FM: Did you ever think about being a fetus?</span></p> <p><span>IM: I have never thought of myself in those terms, simply because we don\u2019t have any memory. Salvador Dali claimed to remember being in the womb. There simply isn\u2019t enough connectivity between neurons to lay down memories.</span></p> <p><span>FM: \u201cNutshell\u201d is clearly pushing some boundaries, but is there anything that you would never write about?</span></p> <p><span>IM: Yes. Golf. One of the most tedious games I\u2019ve ever witnessed. Maybe taxes. Joking apart, I think all writers should be prepared to address all subjects. The issue is not what the subject is but what we do with it.</span></p> <p><span>FM: Speaking of writers, who are some writers who have influenced you?</span></p> <p><span>IM: At the beginning of my career, I was very influenced by Kafka. He was partly the source for a whole series of unusual narrators. \u201cNutshell\u201d has an origin in that influence. But over my lifetime, I guess everything influences me, specifically everything I enjoy. Beyond a certain stage, influence becomes less important. Influence is really what happens to a writer in the first years of his or her caree. Then they find their way forward.</span></p> <p><span>FM: You told me earlier that writing \u201cNutshell\u201d was like going back to the beginning of your career. How so?</span></p> <p><span>IM: It was rejuvenating. Earlier this year, my publisher brought out my first book. I looked at these stories for the first time maybe since reading the proofs, and that was an extraordinary thing. They seemed so remote from me, but at the same time so familiar\u2014a curious sensation. Connecting back with that kind of narrator was a holiday of the senses.</span></p> <p><span>FM: Many of your books have been made into movies. Have you thought about \u201cNutshell\u201d as a film? Who would play the fetus?</span></p> <p><span>IM: Yes, well I can\u2019t see Tom Hanks playing the fetus somehow. When I finished the novel, I thought \u201cThis is safe from any movie adaptations,\u201d but we\u2019ve already had inquiries. I think computer-generated imaging has opened the field so you can do virtually anything.</span></p> <p><span>FM: The fetus thinks a lot about the world he\u2019s being born into\u2014he is very self-aware and has a firm worldview. To what extent are his thoughts your own?</span></p> <p><span>IM: Sometimes they are my own. Sometimes they are just playful fantasies. I just let him go where he wanted, so it is a bit of one and a bit of the other.</span></p> <p><span>FM: What would the fetus think of this world with its current political situation?</span></p> <p><span>IM: I think my fetus would be alarmed at the prospect of a Trump presidency. His vote would probably be cast out of fear of Trump. The fetus tries to find reasons to be cheerful and curious about the world in the 21st century, but one of his main concerns is whether we can scrape through the next 80 odd years without the use of nuclear weapons. On the evidence so far, I don\u2019t see Donald Trump will serve the cause well.</span></p>"}
{"title": "\u200bWhen \u2018Wrong!\u2019s Make a Right | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Heading into Monday night\u2019s debate, the nation expected very little from two of its opposing characters.</span></p> <p><span>One of these characters, of course, was Donald Trump, in part because his campaign had cultivated such low expectations. Despite having never debated fewer than three opponents at a time\u2014allowing him to go into \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/10/who-will-win/497561/\">a kind of hibernation</a>\u201d whenever the discussion turned toward basic substance\u2014Trump apparently scorned traditional debate preparation, preferring sessions of \u201c<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/24/us/politics/presidential-debate-hillary-clinton-donald-trump.html?_r=1\">spitballing ideas with his team</a>.\u201d MSNBC, in its pre-debate analysis, identified <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nycsouthpaw/status/780407104695853056\">three tasks</a> for each candidate. Hillary Clinton, as the first female candidate ever on such a stage, had to sell her vision for her presidency to an audience of 80 million while maintaining an intimate presentation (no shouting!) and getting \u201cthose jokes off\u201d (smile more, sweetheart!). Trump, meanwhile, had to \u201cstop lying,\u201d \u201cshow humility,\u201d and \u201cfill in the gaps in his policy proposals.\u201d The gendered implications of such wildly different standards, as noted in the tweet linked above, were hard to miss.</span></p> <p><span>Luckily for Trump, the opposing player also expected to flop was his principal target for his 15-months-and-running campaign: Truth. Like Trump, Truth just isn\u2019t at home in the debate setting. Fact-checking a debate is necessary, but it\u2019s tricky for a moderator to intervene when appropriate. Janet Brown, the executive director of the Commission on Presidential Debates, <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/25/media/janet-brown-presidential-debate/\">said</a> the candidates should \u201cfact-check each other,\u201d since the moderator would otherwise have to decide, in real time, what counted as a big enough lie to prompt intervention.</span></p> <p><span>Brown took flak from the left, but it\u2019s a good point: If a moderator interrupted to correct a rounded-up statistic (like a national debt of \u201c20 trillion,\u201d as Trump said <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/27/us/politics/transcript-debate.html\">six times</a> on Monday) or an <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dont-believe-trumps-tax-math-or-anyone-elses/\">optimistic budget projection</a>, we\u2019d rarely hear the politicians.</span></p> <p><span>Further lowering the bar for Truth, one candidate soars past even stereotypical politicians in his disregard for reality. Trump <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/\">lies</a> <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2016/09/26/journalists-are-calling-out-trumps-debate-lies/213328\">with</a> <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/emilywillingham/2016/09/27/why-does-donald-trump-lie-so-much/\">such</a> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/09/opinion/donald-trumps-big-liar-technique.html\">dazzling</a> <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/9/26/13016146/donald-trump-liar-media\">abandon</a> that any attempt to hold him to a reasonable standard of accuracy would grind the debate to a halt.</span></p> <p><span>And yet, though Trump <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/clinton-won-the-debate-which-means-shes-likely-to-gain-in-the-polls/\">failed to meet</a> even his rock-bottom expectations, Truth fared surprisingly well. At the debate\u2019s beginning, moderator Lester Holt established that the debate would take place in the universe described by facts and statistics\u2014where \u201ca record six years of job growth\u201d and rising incomes coexist with \u201csignificant\u201d income inequality\u2014rather than in Trump\u2019s near-apocalyptic post-industrial hellscape. This did not stop Trump from gravely intoning that \u201cour jobs are fleeing the country\u201d just a few minutes later, but it did at least challenge Trump\u2019s truth-less portrayal of the state of the nation.</span></p> <p><span>The more memorable shining moment for Truth happened later in the debate. Helpfully, we <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/08/us/politics/matt-lauer-forum.html\">found a lower limit</a> for moderatorial diligence three weeks ago: Matt Lauer did not follow up with a single question after Trump claimed that he had opposed the war in Iraq before it started, giving rise to the excellent hashtag #<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/laueringthebar\">laueringthebar</a>. The backlash <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/09/26/on-donald-trump-and-iraq-lester-holt-avenges-matt-lauer/\">seemed to have motivated</a> Holt, Lauer\u2019s NBC colleague, to repeat that Trump \u201chad supported the war in Iraq before the invasion,\u201d that he \u201csupported it,\u201d and that \u201cthe record shows\u201d that he was not against the war.</span></p> <p><span>Good on you, Lester Holt.</span></p> <p><span>But even if Trump lost a few exchanges to Truth, there were a few where he came out ahead. Obviously, he <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/27/us/politics/fact-check-debate.html\">told a lot of lies</a> (as did Clinton, though not nearly to the same degree). But, more worryingly for supporters of Truth, Trump revealed what might be a winning strategy in his long march on facts: Just call it \u201cWrong!\u201d</span></p> <p><span>No need for supporting evidence. No need to even believe that the statement in question is wrong. Whenever your opponent says anything to your disadvantage, just rudely interrupt her with a loud \u201cWrong!\u201d Acceptable alternatives include \u201cIt\u2019s lies,\u201d \u201cI did not say that\u201d and \u201cI never said that,\u201d \u201cUgh,\u201d and my favorite, \u201cNot!\u201d In all, Trump interjected dozens of words or phrases that simply denied what Clinton said immediately before, regardless of her veracity. It was immature, often totally false, and brilliant<em>.</em></span></p> <p><span>The secret, of course, is that the election will be decided not by who best aligns with Truth but by the votes of human beings with human psychologies. When the brain is presented with contradictory information, it\u2019s put under a much heavier cognitive load than if it\u2019s presented with just one claim at a time. This stress would make debate viewers <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1722019\">more likely to use heuristics</a>\u2014like whether they trust Trump or Clinton more, which is bafflingly <a href=\"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2016/images/09/05/rel13a.-.2016.post-labor.day.pdf\">to Trump\u2019s advantage</a>\u2014rather than \u201ceffortful processing,\u201d which might involve logical reasoning or a Google search. Whenever Trump interjected, he significantly weakened the impact of whatever Clinton was saying. However <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/09/trumps-incoherent-ideas-about-the-cyber/501839/\">incoherent his thoughts</a> on \u201ccyber,\u201d he was able to hack America\u2019s brain for 90 minutes.</span></p> <p><span>Given the results of the polls immediately after the debate, this tactic didn\u2019t quite work\u2014or it was outweighed by Trump\u2019s other problems, like his increasingly nervous <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/28/us/politics/trump-clinton-debate-body-language.html\">body language</a> or his disastrous responses to questions about his <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-trumps-fortunes-turned-south-with-a-rambling-birther-answer/2016/09/27/09443292-8440-11e6-92c2-14b64f3d453f_story.html\">racism</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/28/us/politics/women-voters-reaction.html\">misogyny</a>. But, as with some of <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/column/after-the-fact/article/2016/9/15/trump-gain-loss-asymmetry/\">Trump\u2019s other strategies</a>, we\u2019re left to wonder whether a candidate with more polish or experience\u2014or in <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21706525-politicians-have-always-lied-does-it-matter-if-they-leave-truth-behind-entirely-art?fsrc=scn%2Ftw%2Fte%2Fpe%2Fed%2Fartofthelie\">a(n even) less robust political system</a>\u2014could use it to greater effect. It\u2019s possible that Trump, like Roosevelt with radio speeches or Obama with online fundraising, has uncovered an optimal strategy that will shape campaigns for decades: To simply deny the truth at all costs, knowing that ultimately belated fact-checkers won\u2019t change hearts and minds nearly as much as the loudness of your own bluster. If this is the case, I can only pray that our future leaders don\u2019t follow in Trump\u2019s footsteps.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Harvard, Undocumented | Magazine | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Shankar Ramkellawan \u201919 carries his papers with him everywhere, and he\u2019ll show them to you if you ask.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cYou just never know when you\u2019ll need them,\u201d he says, unzipping his backpack. \u201cActually, I needed them just yesterday.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>He slides two pages and a photo ID across the table. The paperwork looks no different from the forms one might fill out at the DMV or doctor\u2019s office, and the ID card looks like a driver\u2019s license but doesn\u2019t bear the name of a state. Below his picture, the card indicates the country where he was born: Guyana.</span></p> <p><span>At first glance, the documents don\u2019t seem like much, but for Ramkellawan and other undocumented immigrants like him, the papers constitute a \u201csocial fingerprint.\u201d Through Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (commonly known as DACA), young immigrants become eligible for work authorization, a Social Security number, and most importantly, exemption from deportation. As long as he pays a $500 renewal fee every two years, Ramkellawan can be relatively certain that he will not be deported.</span></p> <p><span>DACA, created through an Obama administration executive order, confers a type of legal status to its recipients, but its effects stretch past the realm of paperwork and bureaucracy. Since the launch of DACA in 2012, young immigrants at Harvard and beyond have become increasingly open about being undocumented.</span></p> <p><span>Although the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid cannot collect data on Harvard\u2019s undocumented population, outgoing Dean of Diversity and Inclusion Emelyn A. dela Pe\u00f1a estimates that there are about 40 undocumented students at the College. Admissions officers do not consider immigration status when making admissions decisions, and undocumented students receive full need-based financial aid as their peers do. In addition, Harvard often funds DACA renewal fees and similar expenses for undocumented students.</span></p> <p><span>One might expect an undocumented student to speak about his immigration status in hushed tones, but Ramkellawan does the opposite\u2014he talks boisterously over the low hum of the dining hall, animates his words with gestures, and brandishes his DACA papers under the bright lights.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s not like anyone will report me and get me deported,\u201d he says with a laugh.</span></p> <p><span>Though he\u2019s confident, Ramkellawan faces persistent uncertainties about his family\u2019s future. He and other DACA beneficiaries at Harvard and across the country are beginning their adult lives in a political climate that is both turbulent and stagnant for undocumented immigrants. DACA, which grants its recipients the freedom to work and drive without fear of deportation, has its limits. The DREAM Act, an immigration reform bill that would provide a path to citizenship for undocumented young people, was introduced in Congress in 2001 and still has not been passed. Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA), a policy that would support mixed-status families by allowing undocumented parents to work, was effectively destroyed by a Supreme Court deadlock in June. What\u2019s more, a contentious presidential election has unearthed virulent anti-immigrant sentiments.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMy parents always told me to never tell anyone\u201d of being undocumented, Ramkellawan says. \u201cI was, and still am, trying to grasp what it really means.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Growing up in an undocumented family often means growing up fast\u2014many students share memories of filling out forms, translating for parents who don\u2019t speak English, and picking up other adult responsibilities early in life.</span></p> <p><span>When Jin K. Park \u201918 was a child, for example, he combed the internet for burn remedies after his father, a restaurant worker, was injured on the job. Because his father\u2019s low-income, undocumented status left him ineligible for most forms of healthcare, Park, the family\u2019s only fluent English speaker, turned to WebMD for solutions. </span></p> <p><span>A handful of Harvard students come from mixed-status families, meaning that some relatives are undocumented and others are not. Romance Languages and Literature assistant professor Lorgia H. Garc\u00eda Pe\u00f1a, whose scholarship focuses on racial identity and migration, grew up with two undocumented brothers and emphasizes that immigration status \u201cimpacts a whole family\u201d even if some members have citizenship. Ana C. Andrade \u201919, who was born at Cambridge Hospital near Harvard\u2019s campus, belongs to such a family. Though a U.S. citizen, she says her life has been shaped by her parents\u2019 undocumented status.</span></p> <p><span>When Andrade was four months old, her father, an undocumented Brazilian immigrant who had crossed the border, was deported. Though her father eventually returned to the U.S., his legal status remained uncertain. When Andrade was 16 years old, a police officer stopped her father for driving without valid identification. Andrade, a licensed driver, had to pick him up in the middle of the night. Fortunately, the officer let her father go.</span></p> <p><span>Because parents without papers struggle to secure permanent employment, undocumented families often struggle to make ends meet. Ramkellawan\u2019s family lived in a \u201csuper moldy\u201d basement for $400 a month before upgrading to a one-bedroom apartment in the Bronx. Paulo J. Pinto \u201918, an undocumented student from Portugal who leads student activism group Act on a Dream, recalls that his parents were unable to negotiate with their employers because of their immigration status, leaving them to take jobs that paid \u201cunder the table.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Undocumented status often reconfigures typical family dynamics. Some argue that DACA, which authorizes its recipients to work and drive, has reinforced this effect.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now with the DACA beneficiaries is that some of these young people are now taking on a lot of extra work within the family: driving parents to and from work, driving siblings to work, taking on these breadwinner roles,\u201d says Roberto G. Gonzales, a professor at the Graduate School of Education whose work focuses on undocumented status and academic performance.  \u201c[DACA recipients] are working longer hours, more jobs, so they can contribute more to family expenses, paying larger shares of family bills, rent, mortgage, et cetera.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Garc\u00eda Pe\u00f1a offers a more pointed critique of DACA\u2014she considers the policy a disappointment.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe message DACA sent out and the message President Obama sent was precisely that the immigrant community belongs in the workforce and not in school,\u201d she says. \u201cWe need to do a lot better in passing a much more comprehensive reform for people who came here as children who are trying to go to school.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Equally worrisome is the growing backlog of DACA renewals. Gonzales says that if no comprehensive immigration reform passes, DACA recipients will be \u201cperpetually in limbo,\u201d their fates set by paperwork and processing time.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThey will continue to have to make sure that their applications are in on time, they will continue to face the prospect that their applications will not be processed in a timely manner and therefore they\u2019ll fall out of status,\u201d he explains. \u201cThere are <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/these-immigrants-followed-the-rules-but-they-still-may-lose-their-jobs-1df37d99b7ea#.5007slufe\">about 500 DACA beneficiaries</a> now who have fallen out of status because of a backlog, and they have to leave work for whatever period of time because they don\u2019t have work authorization during that lapse of time.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>When Park filled out his college applications, he typed 10 zeroes where his Social Security number belonged. He hadn\u2019t yet received a Social Security number through DACA. He didn\u2019t fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, because non-citizens are ineligible for federal aid.</span></p> <p><span>According to Harvard\u2019s Admissions and Financial Aid website, undocumented students are supposed to apply as international students, even if they have spent the majority of their lives in the U.S. Although they do not qualify for federal funding, undocumented and international students alike receive need-based financial aid from the University. Many immigration reform advocates, including Garc\u00eda Pe\u00f1a, feel that this policy alienates undocumented applicants.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThat is the biggest hurdle undocumented students face when they are applying to college\u2014being treated as foreigners when they are not,\u201d Garcia Pe\u00f1a says. \u201cInternational students tend to come from higher class [backgrounds], and tend to have more resources that are not available to undocumented students.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Harvard accepts all students\u2014including those who apply as international students\u2014on a need-blind basis, offering full need-based financial aid to those who are admitted. Although Harvard\u2019s admissions policy does not affect the amount of financial aid that undocumented students receive, former Act on a Dream chair Anahi D. Mendoza \u201915 insists that it sends a discouraging message to undocumented applicants.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think Harvard\u2019s really behind,\u201d Mendoza says. \u201cIt feels like they\u2019re opening the back door for us.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Mendoza says that Harvard should \u201ccatch up\u201d to Brown University and Tufts University, two peer institutions that have made strides in their inclusion of undocumented applicants. In the spring of 2015, Tufts Dean of Admissions Lee Coffin announced that undocumented students would be included in the college\u2019s domestic applicant pool. For this fall\u2019s application cycle, Brown is following suit.  These policies will make it easier for undocumented students to receive financial aid, as both universities accept international applicants in a process that is not need-blind.</span></p> <p><span>Other members of Act on a Dream lament the lack of information available for undocumented applicants\u2014some say that the Admissions and Financial Aid Office needs to be more explicit in welcoming undocumented high school students to apply. On the College\u2019s website, for example, information for prospective undocumented applicants is buried<a href=\"https://college.harvard.edu/frequently-asked-questions\"> in an FAQ section</a>. By contrast, the Admissions website offers a plethora of blogs and testimonies for applicants from low-income, multicultural, and first-generation backgrounds. While undocumented students commonly fit into those categories, many feel that their representation is insufficient.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think Harvard can be a little more proactive in terms of saying, \u2018We accept undocumented students,\u2019\u201d Pinto says. \u201cOn the website, it\u2019s kind of unclear.\u201d A statement from Office of Admissions and Financial Aid spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven says that administrators \u201ccertainly take all feedback on [the] website into account in making updates and additions.\u201d </span></p> <p><span>Act on a Dream, which now has an informal partnership with the Admissions and Financial Aid Office, was founded in 2008 as a group for immigration reform advocacy, but has gradually taken on the role of providing resources for undocumented Harvard applicants and students. Because many undocumented students feel that Harvard\u2019s administrative resources are inadequate, Act on a Dream often acts as an informal support network. The<a href=\"http://www.actonadream.org/\"> club\u2019s website</a> features a 30-page online handbook for high school students, offering advice on scholarship applications, reaching out to financial aid officers at universities, and writing college essays.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAct on a Dream was created to be an activist organization, not to provide resources, but because we lacked so many resources, that\u2019s kind of what it became,\u201d Mendoza says. Through their partnership with the group, the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid sends a spring welcome letter to admitted students who have disclosed their status. A number of undocumented students, however, feel that Harvard\u2019s support lessens by the time they move into the Yard.</span></p> <p><span>Although Pinto does not have a passport, he spent the summer studying Shakespeare and Keynesian economics in Venice, Italy. Before his summer program began, he went to Portugal to visit family members he hadn\u2019t seen in 15 years. After his classes ended, he left the island city for an impressive tour of Europe.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI went to Florence, Rome, Milan, Paris, Edinburgh, London, Amsterdam, Barcelona, and Vienna,\u201d he says, counting on his fingers.</span></p> <p><span>All of this was possible because of advance parole, a government-granted document that allows DACA recipients to travel internationally. An application for advance parole, which must be filed several months before leaving the U.S., costs a steep $360. However, undergraduate DACA beneficiaries like Pinto need not be deterred by the fee\u2014through the College\u2019s Beneficiary Aid Program, undocumented students can have their advance parole applications and DACA renewals funded by Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>Despite the University\u2019s financial generosity, some argue that Harvard has a ways to go in its outreach and support for undocumented students. Although the College has attempted to bolster its administrative support, many undocumented students have deemed it inadequate. Moreover, experts and students are calling for additional emotional support for undocumented students, who often struggle with mental health issues.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cSometimes I feel like they admitted me and then I got here and there isn\u2019t open support about the fact that they admit undocumented students,\u201d Park says. \u201cCan [the administration] say that it\u2019s OK for us to be here? Even though the letter said that we got in, it sometimes doesn\u2019t feel like we\u2019re entirely welcome.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Two years ago, the Office of Student Life appointed dela Pe\u00f1a to advise undocumented students. On paper, this seemed to be a victory for Harvard\u2019s undocumented students, who had submitted requests for such an administrator. In practice, several students\u2014particularly leaders of Act on a Dream\u2014found the appointment insufficient. Dela Pe\u00f1a, who was also in charge of BGLTQ Student Life and the Women\u2019s Center, seemed to have little time to help undocumented students.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe tried to get her to have office hours for undocumented students on a weekly basis where people could drop in, but I think she had a lot of other things to do,\u201d says Enrique Ramirez \u201917, a board member of Act on a Dream.</span></p> <p><span>Echoing Ramirez, Mendoza says that dela Pe\u00f1a seemed to have a \u201cfigurehead\u201d role, although the position was quite new when Mendoza was still a student at Harvard. According to Pinto, several board members of Act on a Dream were unaware of dela Pe\u00f1a\u2019s upcoming departure until they read about it in The Crimson. In October, dela Pe\u00f1a will take a position at Washington University at St. Louis. Although Harvard has not yet hired her replacement, Loc Truong will assume her position as an adviser to undocumented students.</span></p> <p><span>Dela Pe\u00f1a says that she has a philosophy of \u201ctaking a backseat\u201d because students understand student needs better than administrators do. \u201cI have actually gotten feedback from students saying, \u2018You should just let us decide what we want to do with programs and events, then give us the resources to do that,\u2019\u201d she says.</span></p> <p><span>Gonzales, an expert on immigration and education, emphasizes the necessity for an administrative liaison like dela Pe\u00f1a\u2014someone to help students \u201ccut through red tape.\u201d However, anecdotal evidence and Gonzales\u2019s own research suggest that undocumented young people often need emotional support in addition to bureaucratic assistance.</span></p> <p><span>Starting in 2002, Gonzales conducted a 12-year study of young undocumented adults in Los Angeles, examining the academic and career trajectories of 150 immigrants. The most surprising finding, he says, was the prevalence of mental health challenges among his respondents.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAll of these young people that I talked to described physical and emotional manifestations of stress\u2014chronic headaches, toothaches, trouble getting out of bed in the morning, eating disorders, thoughts of suicide, and attempted suicide,\u201d Gonzales says. \u201cSo it became clear that there is a very strong link between their immigration status and their strained wellbeing.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Ilian A. Meza-Pe\u00f1a \u201917 says that several of her undocumented friends deal with clinical depression and anxiety\u2014the \u201cUndocumented Student Starter Pack,\u201d as she calls it. Two mental health counselors at University Health Services, Carmen M. Cruz and L. Carolina Gonzalez, are well-known among undocumented students for their cultural competency and knowledge of immigration issues.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThey\u2019re really good and supportive,\u201d Meza-Pe\u00f1a says. \u201cBut they\u2019re only two people.\u201d In response to inquiries about mental health resources for undocumented students, Chief of Counseling and Mental Health Services Barbara Lewis says that  \u201call counselors at HUHS receive regular training on a variety of topics and competencies,\u201d although each counselor has individual specialties and interests. </span></p> <p><span>In his research, Gonzales observed many respondents taking classes at public universities and community colleges on a term-by-term basis, taking hiatuses for personal and financial reasons. Even at selective private schools schools like Harvard, however, a similar pattern of \u201cstopping out\u201d\u2014taking a year off with the intention of returning\u2014seems to emerge among undocumented populations.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cFor most of the undocumented students\u2026 finances are the number one driver for stopping out,\u201d Gonzales says. \u201cHarvard is very generous, but nevertheless, the cost of books, the remainder of tuition sometimes, and other expenses really add up, and students find themselves in a bind financially.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Mendoza recalls that several of her undocumented friends left Harvard for a year or two before graduating, motivated by both mental health struggles and financial obligations. DACA beneficiaries are especially pressured to get jobs and provide for their families.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cOne of the hardest things about being undocumented at Harvard is graduating,\u201d Mendoza says. \u201cNot only are we students at the University\u2014we\u2019re also heads of household and are expected to send money back home for surgeries or food.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The claim that Harvard doesn\u2019t do enough for its undocumented population may seem incongruous with the institution\u2019s public image\u2014University President Drew G. Faust, for example, has been a vocal proponent of DACA and the DREAM Act.</span></p> <p><span>The DREAM Act was first proposed in the summer of 2001\u2014more than 15 years ago\u2014and has been reintroduced several times since, although it has never passed. Unlike DACA, which targets a similar demographic, the DREAM Act guarantees a path to citizenship. Faust <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2009/5/22/faust-voices-support-for-dream-act/\">first endorsed the DREAM Act</a> in 2009, but her support was concretized a year later, when she intervened in the case of Eric Balderas \u201913.</span></p> <p><span>Balderas, an undocumented immigrant born in Mexico, was detained at the San Antonio airport in 2010 for traveling without acceptable identification. Facing the prospect of deportation, Balderas garnered national attention\u2014the fact that he was a <a href=\"http://archive.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/06/19/harvard_student_wont_face_deportation/\">\u201csoft-spoken\u201d Harvard student</a> made for splashy headlines. Pressured by Faust, Illinois Senator Dick Durbin, and other supporters, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) dropped Balderas\u2019s case and granted him deferred action status.</span></p> <p><span><a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2010/9/15/balderas-faust-undocumented/\">A photo</a> from a 2010 issue of The Crimson immortalizes Faust\u2019s advocacy for young undocumented immigrants: In a red-walled office at the U.S. Capitol, she stands smiling between Balderas and Durbin, thanking the senator for his sponsorship of the DREAM Act.</span></p> <p><span>Four years later, Dario M. Guerrero \u201915 similarly <a href=\"http://college.usatoday.com/2014/10/14/harvard-student-took-his-dying-mom-to-mexico-now-hes-not-allowed-to-leave/\">made national news</a>. When his mother\u2019s chemotherapy treatments failed, Guerrero brought her back to Mexico, their home country, hoping to prolong her life at holistic medicine centers. About two months before Guerrero planned to leave, he applied for advance parole and waited. Eventually, he says, he just decided to go \u201cwith no indication that my parole would be granted anytime soon.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMy mother, her condition was starting to decline a bit,\u201d Guerrero says. \u201cSo, fuck it. Yeah, we left.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Guerrero\u2019s mother died in August of 2014. Instead of going back to school, however, he remained stranded in Mexico City for two months\u2014USCIS denied his re-entry to the States. Guerrero called Leverett Resident Dean Bilal Malik, who \u201ctold [Guerrero] he was going to get in touch with the necessary parties at Harvard and beyond.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Because Harvard cannot provide legal counsel, Guerrero relied on a nonprofit that connected him to a pro-bono immigration lawyer. As in Balderas\u2019s case, a number of legislators went to bat for Guerrero.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHarvard was also able to connect me with this senator in Illinois, Dick Durbin, and this Congressman in Boston,\u201d Guerrero recalls. \u201cSo the representatives\u2019s offices were coordinating with my lawyer to put pressure on USCIS to grant me humanitarian parole.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Ultimately, their efforts were successful. Guerrero returned to Harvard and graduated with a degree in Visual and Environmental Studies. Gonzales says that cases like those of Guerrero and Balderas, although high profile, constitute a small fraction of deportation cases. The few immigrants who have connections to university presidents and elected officials often have the most success in avoiding deportation, Gonzales says. \u201cBut most people don\u2019t have those relationships, and most people in those situations fall through the cracks,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>As undocumented students look ahead, past the gates of Harvard Yard and beyond this November, the future may seem daunting. As the election draws near, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump continues to spread vitriolic anti-immigrant rhetoric. In Washington, the Supreme Court remains tied on a landmark immigration case, U.S. vs. Texas, leaving undocumented parents vulnerable.</span></p> <p><span>In June 2016, the Supreme Court announced that it had reached a 4-4 tie in U.S. vs. Texas, therefore upholding an appeals court decision to block DAPA. DAPA, like DACA, was created through an Obama administration executive action in 2012. The policy would have allowed undocumented parents of U.S. citizens and lawful residents to get driver\u2019s licenses, work authorization, and Social Security numbers. Like DACA beneficiaries, DAPA recipients would have been shielded from deportation.</span></p> <p><span>When asked about U.S. v. Texas, Andrade recalls the days when she learned how to drive. When Andrade first received her learner\u2019s permit, she was only allowed to drive with her mother, who has a driver\u2019s license.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI could drive with her, and only her, because she didn\u2019t want my dad to feel bad if my uncles were teaching me how to drive\u2014if they were doing something that he couldn\u2019t do for me,\u201d Andrade recounts. Andrade\u2019s father may have been a recipient of DAPA if the U.S. vs. Texas Supreme Court tie hadn\u2019t blocked it.</span></p> <p><span>Although Andrade will be able to petition for her parents to become U.S. citizens when she turns 21, she realizes that the process will not be easy. Because her father was deported and returned by crossing the border, he is unlikely to gain citizenship, and her mother has been trying to get a Green Card for several years. As a citizen, Andrade feels pressure to find high-paying employment that her parents are unlikely to secure. DAPA, she says, would have taken \u201ca huge weight off [her] shoulders.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Maribel Nava \u201919, a U.S. citizen born to undocumented Mexican parents, was certain that her parents would have qualified for DAPA when it was first announced in 2012. The Supreme Court decision left her disappointed, but she remains hopeful. </span></p> <p><span>\u201cI knew it was complicated with Scalia and that the worst-case scenario was happening\u2014they\u2019re not going to let Obama appoint a new judge,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful because it is a presidential election this year, Hillary\u2019s promised to try something different from DAPA that will work within her first 100 days in office.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Legislation aside, the pressure for undocumented students to provide for their families persists. While dozens of Harvard students compete for international fellowships, many of their undocumented peers are inclined to move somewhere close to home after graduation.</span></p> <p><span>For Park, being away from his parents in New York City is a source of constant worry. \u201cIf they get sick, I don\u2019t think they would know what to do,\u201d he explains. \u201cIf something happened to them, everything in terms of my life is unplugged\u2014my parents come first.\u201d Park hopes to attend medical school. He is passionate about someday reforming health care policy\u2014particularly because the Affordable Care Act does not serve undocumented immigrants.</span></p> <p><span>For Daishi M. Tanaka \u201919, the burden of financial independence is particularly heavy\u2014his parents, immigrants from Japan, left the U.S. this summer. Because they were undocumented, Tanaka\u2019s parents struggled to find stable jobs and were frequently manipulated by employers. Because they were undocumented, it seems unlikely that they will be able to return to the U.S.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cNow my pressure is to support myself as someone living in the U.S. alone,\u201d Tanaka says. Through advance parole, Tanaka was able to visit his parents in Japan, but he is uncertain of when he\u2019ll see them again. \u201cSince I\u2019m financially independent I have to, you know, think about my finances first and see if I can afford to do that.\u201d </span></p> <p><span>Finding a job as an undocumented Harvard graduate is often an intimidating process\u2014Mendoza, who graduated last year, said that many people reach out to her for advice, nervous to disclose their immigration status to employers.</span></p> <p><span>Guerrero, who can get jobs because of humanitarian parole, is living at home in L.A. because his work authorization was not processed in time\u2014he had accepted a fellowship in D.C. and had to leave after two weeks. With comprehensive legislative reform stalled and graduates from one of the most prestigious universities in the world struggling to find employment, undocumented students commonly feel helpless.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cNo matter how much money I have, I can never take my dad on a vacation to, say, Punta Cana because he can\u2019t come back. I can never take my mom to see her father and mother that she hasn\u2019t seen in so long,\u201d Andrade says. \u201cI think that\u2019s really aggravating to be at a place where my opportunities seem so endless when in fact there\u2019s nothing I can do.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Most members of Harvard\u2019s undocumented community acknowledge that they make up a particularly privileged subset of immigrants. When her father was pulled over by a policeman on her freshman move-in day last year, Andrade learned that the Harvard name alone acts as a kind of security.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere\u2019s safety with Harvard, without question,\u201d she says. \u201cJust the name.\u201d Her father had only been pulled over twice before. When he handed his Brazilian passport to the officer, Andrade worried that he would again be deported.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe cop looked at me, looked at the back of the truck with all this Harvard move-in stuff,\u201d she recounts. Tossing the passport back into the car, the policeman told Andrade\u2019s father to get a driver\u2019s license and let them proceed. \u201cI can\u2019t help but imagine how that situation would\u2019ve gone differently if he weren\u2019t moving me into Harvard.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Garc\u00eda Pe\u00f1a, who used to teach at the University of Georgia, started an educational nonprofit called Freedom University when the state banned undocumented students from enrolling in public universities. The simple fact that the state of Massachusetts does not ban undocumented students makes for a major difference between the two states where she has taught.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cOne of the things I see my students come struggling with, both my Freedom U grads and some of my students at Harvard, is feeling guilty that they get to do this while other people can\u2019t,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of responsibility for those who will stay behind.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>At Harvard, it seems that this sense of indebtedness feeds into activism. Mendoza affirms that Act on a Dream is committed to serving undocumented high school students, particularly because of the group\u2019s position as a Harvard organization: \u201cEven though we are undocumented students at Harvard, we are still very privileged.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Ramirez, who attended a vocational high school where 12 percent of his graduating class went to college, feels fortunate in comparison to many of his peers back home.  \u201cA lot of the narratives we see ourselves having, it\u2019s really contrasting with people at Harvard who are so privileged,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>For some, the simple act of being publicly undocumented\u2014of making an unseen population visible\u2014is, in itself, a kind of activism.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI am very open, as you can see when I show everyone my papers,\u201d Ramkellawan says, putting them back in his backpack. \u201cI go to Harvard and it is important for me to educate.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Marella A.

Gal Lin, Co-Chair of The Israel Caucus at the Kennedy School, said these efforts influenced Israelis\u2019 perception of him.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe was both instrumental in solidifying Israel\u2019s security and in pursuing peace.

{"title": "An Aftermath Remedy for Racial Profiling | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Before Donald Trump\u2019s incorrect statements on <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/28/nyregion/what-donald-trump-got-wrong-on-stop-and-frisk.html?_r=0\">stop and frisk</a> during the first presidential debate on Monday night, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled that judges must consider whether or not black men have <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/22/politics/massachusetts-court-ruling-fleeing-police/\">reasonable reason</a> to flee in a police encounter on a case-by-case basis.</span></p> <p><span>The court held unanimously that black men could potentially flee in order to avoid the humiliation of racial profiling, rather than avoid arrest because they are guilty. In the wake of a long line of tragedies, we applaud this ruling for ensuring that justifiable fear and panic in an encounter with the police is not falsely equated with culpability. Nevertheless, this ruling\u2014which is largely a legal technicality\u2014is in no way a solution to persisting racial profiling in policing. More proactive measures, such as increased training, accountability, and structural reforms are the ultimate solutions to the plight of minorities before the law enforcement system, but until they are enacted, courts should accordingly exercise caution in their rulings and in their interpretations of evidence.</span></p> <p><span>This court decision is the result of the case <a href=\"http://www.mass.gov/courts/docs/sjc/reporter-of-decisions/new-opinions/11956.pdf\">Commonwealth vs. Jimmy Warren.</a> In December 2011, Warren was stopped by police looking for suspects in a break-in in Roxbury. The police were working off of a vague <a href=\"http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/09/20/sjc-judges-must-consider-high-rate-fios-between-boston-police-and-men-color/0baqga4wecvXxsWZwSnNlI/story.html\">description</a> of \u201ctwo men in black hooded sweat shirts and a third wearing a red hooded sweatshirt.\u201d Warren was asked to stop by two different officers, but his refusal caused the encounter to result in a chase at gunpoint, arrest, and a charge for unlawful possession of firearm, despite the fact that Warren was innocent of the crime the police officers were initially investigating.</span></p> <p><span>Though the exact prudence of Warren\u2019s course of action may be questioned, the police should have never approached him in the first place. Indeed, there is statistical corroboration that Warren had reason to believe they were unjustifiably biased against him. The ruling was based in large part on an American Civil Liberties Union report that found that black people <a href=\"https://aclum.org/our-work/aclum-issues/racial-justice/ending-racist-stop-and-frisk/\">accounted</a> for 63 percent of field interrogations despite composing only 24 percent of Boston\u2019s population between 2007 and 2010.</span></p> <p><span>Racial profiling, however, is not endemic to Massachusetts; it has a long history in criminal justice and policing. In traffic stops alone, black drivers are <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/07/08/the-big-question-about-why-police-pull-over-so-many-black-drivers/\">more likely</a> to be stopped for no major reason and punished for minor traffic infractions. Data from many states has shown that police target minority communities for drug offenses, even though marijuana and other drug use rates are usually the same as or <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/09/30/white-people-are-more-likely-to-deal-drugs-but-black-people-are-more-likely-to-get-arrested-for-it/\">even higher</a> for white communities. <a href=\"http://mappingpoliceviolence.org/unarmed/\">Unarmed</a> black people are also killed by police at five times the rate of unarmed whites.</span></p> <p><span>These realities make it reasonable for the black community, particularly black males, to be concerned about their safety in police encounters. In addition to the \u201cindignity of being racially profiled\u201d that the court found as reasonable motivation for fleeing police encounters, both judges and police officers need to realize the role of fear. Often, there are very low levels of trust in highly-policed minority communities and that trust is only eroded by the tragedies that have occurred. As the court has ruled, a black man has reason to fear that the request to stop will escalate to a more dangerous situation.</span></p> <p><span>Given the current situation of our criminal justice system, we fully agree that courts should consider how fear and racial profiling can affect a defendant\u2019s actions. However, for real change to be made, greater structural reform is necessary. The fear and anxiety that people feel in encounters with the police needs to be realized not only by court justices, but by the policemen and women who initiate the interactions.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Latinos for Trump | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The snowfall was still fresh as I walked through New Hampshire, knocking on doors before the Democratic Primary in February. My canvassing partner was a Colombian born student who started his studies abroad, but decided to finish his education in the U.S., now participating as an active member of the Harvard College Democrats.<br></span></p> <p><span>In an election that has contested what it fundamentally means to be American, the afternoon was more than simple civic duty. It felt more like an attempt to survive in and protect the America that insists it is for all, including us\u2014two Latino men with immigrant backgrounds.</span></p> <p><span>This election\u2019s anti-immigrant sentiments and xenophobia have been terrifying. The Republican nominee, Donald Trump, kicked off his campaign by calling Mexicans rapists and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/08/donald-trumps-false-comments-connecting-mexican-immigrants-and-crime/\">criminals</a>. Then, when the move gained him political points, he continued the rhetoric. He <a href=\"http://fusion.net/story/312578/trump-curiel-definitely-about-mexican-heritage/\">questioned</a> Judge Curiel\u2019s ability to uphold the law because of his Mexican heritage, although Curiel was born in Indiana and is as <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/06/politics/judge-gonzalo-curiel-donald-trump-university/\">American</a> as Trump himself. And, in a <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/280157-jeb-lists-insensitive-aspects-of-trumps-taco-bowl-tweet\">pitiful</a> attempt to save his image, he posted a picture of himself saying he loved Hispanics, the only evidence being a taco bowl.</span></p> <p><span>Donald Trump has made a successful campaign out of questioning American multiculturalism, making Latino individuals question if they have a space in today\u2019s America. The American Dream brought our families here, but who is allowed to dream is questionable after this election. By attacking both undocumented Latinos and Latinos with birthright citizenship, it seems incomprehensible that there would be any Latinos for Trump.</span></p> <p><span>But looking at Hillary Clinton and the Democratic party reveals that there would be understandable reason for more Latinos to support the Republican Party. Hillary Clinton has pandered by claiming that she is like my <a href=\"http://fusion.net/story/248809/why-hillary-clintons-abuela-campaign-backfired-with-latino-voters/\">abuela</a>\u2014which she sure as hell isn\u2019t. Her interventionism as Secretary of State has led to turmoil in <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2016/04/19/hillary-clintons-dodgy-answers-on-honduras-coup/\">Honduras</a>, and she's in large part responsible for the <a href=\"http://www.migrationpolicy.org/programs/us-immigration-policy-program/rising-child-migration-united-states\">influx</a> of unaccompanied Central American children to the United States.</span></p> <p><span>To top things all off, leaked <a href=\"http://fusion.net/story/329431/dnc-leak-latino-voters/\">e-mails</a> from the DNC refer to Latinos as nothing more than a \u201cbrand\u201d to be \u201cacquired\u201d \u2014 as if a whole community of Americans is nothing more than a collection of votes on the way to the presidency. This mythologized Latino monolith continues to erase the fact that the political, cultural, and social realities of Latinos in the United States are wildly diverse.</span></p> <p><span>The political system will only work for those who are present, and Latinos have been missing from the important roles that sustain our democracy. Only <a href=\"http://thehill.com/latino/283736-hispanic-membership-in-congress-expected-to-rise-in-2017\">six percent</a> of the members of Congress are Hispanic. There are only <a href=\"http://www.latinpost.com/articles/121300/20160608/as-the-senior-latino-in-the-senate-bob-menendez-condemns-trumps-racial-remarks-on-hispanic-judge.htm\">three</a> Latino senators in office. There are far fewer Hispanics eligible to vote in the first place, and those who are <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/16/upshot/why-hispanics-dont-have-a-larger-political-voice.html\">eligible</a> to vote have lower turnout rates as well. This disengagement is not always conscious. <a href=\"https://www.californiacitynews.org/2016/05/latinos-still-underrepresented-ca-government-poverty-issue.html\">Poverty</a> and inflexible working-class <a href=\"http://www.whytuesday.org/make-election-day-a-federal-holiday/\">job schedules</a> are known to deter individuals from voting and being involved in the political system, and Latinos are more <a href=\"http://www.feedingamerica.org/hunger-in-america/impact-of-hunger/latino-hunger/latino-hunger-fact-sheet.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/\">likely</a> to find themselves in these situations. When Election Day becomes a choice between taking time to support a party that sees you as no more than a vote or working another hour to put food on the table, the choice is clear.</span></p> <p><span>There is no way of getting the representation this country needs without helping those who have no entrance into the process. Starting at the local level, programs need to be set that build these bridges into the system. Predominantly Latino high schools could offer after school sessions on voting and community organizing for students who don\u2019t hear about how to get involved while at home. The possibilities are endless, but it is essential that political systems on the local, state, and federal level take steps to include all Americans as more than just a voting bloc.</span></p> <p><span>Democracy should work for all, not just those who can afford to be involved. When more of the most influential political seats are held by Latinos, there can be an accurate, diverse understanding of what it means to be Latino\u2014and, in turn, an accurate representation of the political spectrum of the \u201cLatino voter.\u201d The assumed allegiance to a certain party will finally disappear, and politicians and their parties will finally have to face the reality that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latinidad\">latinidad</a> encompasses conservatives, liberals, and everyone in between.</span></p> <p><span>This election season, the idea of Latinos for Trump may seem ridiculous, but the way limited representation has led to polarizing political parties for Latino voters, touting Latinos for Romney or McCain still seems bizarre. As much as we may disagree with the policies of those across the aisle, democracy works best with differing opinions. When Latinos are granted equal access into the process, these perspectives can thrive and both parties can begin to see us as not just Latinos for Trump, or Latinos for Clinton, but rather Latinos for Democracy and Latinos for America.</span></p> <p><span><br></span></p> <p><span><em>Ruben E.

{"title": "If History is Guide, Grad Student Unionization Path May Be Rocky Despite Ruling | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Even after last week\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/8/24/nlrb-grad-student-unionization/\">landmark National Labor Relations Board ruling</a> that would force Harvard to legally recognize an elected graduate student union, the path forward for universities is far from clear.<span class=\"redactor-invisible-space\"></span></span></p> <p><span>The NLRB overturned precedent in ruling that student assistants at private universities are considered employees, and Harvard has invited members of the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers to discuss next steps in light of the decision, according to Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Dean Xiao-Li Meng.</span></p> <p><span>But for graduate students involved in the unionization effort, the fight is not over. Graduate students weathered a period in limbo after the Board first recognized graduate students as employees in 2000, a decision effectively overturned in 2004. That rocky history shows the NLRB's recent decision may not guarantee a smooth path to unionization.</span></p> <p><span>The NLRB visited the issue of unionization in its New York University decision in 2000, granting students at private universities the right to collectively bargain. At that time, graduate students at Harvard <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2000/4/27/tf-unionization-why-it-wont-happen/?page=1\">were not actively seeking a union</a>, but other campuses saw a lot more activity.</span></p> <p><span>Student movements at several Ivy League schools moved forward with plans to hold a union election following the NYU decision. After Brown administrators refused to hold an election, the NLRB scheduled a hearing and ultimately ruled students had a right to hold the election. Ninety percent of eligible graduate students cast their vote in 2001. But because Brown\u2019s request for review was still pending at the time of the election, the ballots were impounded.</span></p> <p><span>William B. Gould, a Stanford Law professor who was chairman of the NLRB from 1994 to 1998, said it is important to have elections right away, especially on college campuses.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf you wait until that issue is resolved, those employees\u2014particularly in the university setting where they go on and graduate and go on to other things\u2014they may never be able to express their position. Because it will take a number of years to have the matter resolved,\u201d Gould said.</span></p> <p><span>By the time the NLRB decided the Brown case in 2004\u2014which allowed universities to ban unions among graduate students\u2014President George W. Bush\u2019s Republican appointees had swung the NLRB rightward, and reversed its NYU decision. The ballots were left uncounted at Brown, as well as at Columbia and the University of Pennsylvania.<br></span></p> <p><span>Labor law expert David Rosenfeld, a lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley, said it will be harder for universities to take a similar avenue, given new union election rules announced in 2015. There is no longer a 25-day period between submitting a petition and holding an election, any post-election challenges are waived, and objections must now be made within seven days of an election.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean [the universities] can\u2019t ultimately delay, but it\u2019s going to make it more difficult,\u201d Rosenfeld said.</span></p> <p><span>It is unclear how Harvard will act going forward. The University <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/8/24/nlrb-grad-student-unionization/\">reaffirmed</a> its opposition to unionization after the decision was released, and again in an email from Meng, the GSAS dean. If an election is held and HGSU-UAW wins, the University could immediately agree to sit down with organizers and negotiate.</span></p> <p><span>But Gould said he expects private universities to challenge the decision. The fact that Harvard has now agreed to sit down with union organizers did not sway his opinion.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThey will emphasize the inhospitable posture of [the Supreme Court] toward bargains in higher education and the chaos that may ensue from the Yale petition today for ten different units,\u201d Gould wrote in an email, referring to the Yale union effort\u2019s move to file ten separate petitions by department. Graduate workers in each of those departments will vote to join a single union, an approach Gould called \u201cunusual.\u201d A recent revision of NLRB rules allowing for \u201cmicrounits\u201d of workers inspired the move, and it theoretically makes it easier for a union to win an election.</span></p> <p><span>In the event of a challenge from universities, Gould said the NLRB  would litigate the matter and raise it before the appellate courts and potentially the Supreme Court.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think we\u2019re going to hear a lot more about this in the coming months,\u201d Gould said. \u201cThe Board is in for a real fight.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Despite the lengthy road ahead, John T. Trumpbour, research director of the Labor and Worklife Program at Harvard Law School, said he believes the students can win their battle.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe Harvard graduate students right now are in a much better position to achieve victory for unions than was the case then,\u201d Trumpbour said. \u201cPeople right now are so much more organized and energized.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In the same turn of events that happened in the early 2000s, the upcoming presidential election could impact the Board\u2019s decision. Trumpbour said a Donald Trump administration would be in the University\u2019s best interest, with the idea that he would pack the NLRB with Republican appointees who would reverse the decision.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThey\u2019re kind of in a tough position because they are very afraid of Trump getting elected for a variety of reasons, but on this particular issue they would much more be in need of a Republican president to get the Board\u2019s composition to change,\u201d Trumpbour said.</span></p>"}

In a letter <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/8/25/letter-iop-williams/\">published</a> in The Crimson and addressed to Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf, 15 University alumni called for Williams\u2019 \u201cimmediate resignation,\u201d condemning her political appointment as being a \u201cconflict of interest\u201d with the nonpartisan nature of the IOP.</span></p> <p><span>Williams\u2019 appointment to the Clinton campaign was never truly unexpected or unprecedented: Williams has been a consistent and <a href=\"http://iop.harvard.edu/about/director\">long-time supporter of the Clintons</a>, working with them since the 1992 election. Even before she was brought in as the IOP Director, she had served as Clinton\u2019s campaign manager in the 2008 election, as her transition director in 1992, and as the Chief of Staff to the First Lady.</span></p> <p><span>We reject the letter\u2019s argument that the leadership of the IOP must not be involved in partisan politics. Maggie Williams has every right to actively support any political cause, and it is especially in her role as IOP Director that she is entitled to\u2014and actively encouraged to\u2014engage in political expression. The IOP's commitment to nonpartisanship does not necessitate the political noninvolvement of its director, and conversely its director\u2019s political beliefs do not taint the IOP\u2019s neutrality.</span></p> <p><span>This principle is borne out by multiple precedents; the IOP has always been led by figures with significant partisan political experience. Williams\u2019 predecessor, C. M. Trey Grayson \u201994, was a prominent Republican and served as Kentucky\u2019s Secretary of State, and his own predecessor, interim IOP Director John Culver \u201954, was a Democratic Senator from Iowa.</span></p> <p><span>More saliently, even conservatives within the IOP have <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/8/26/heye-letter-williams/\">rushed to Williams\u2019 defense</a>. Douglas R. Heye, a Fall 2015 IOP resident fellow and 25-year veteran of Republican politics, has personally attested to Williams\u2019 \u201cunyielding dedication to ensuring conservative voices are represented at the IOP.\" This insider testimony makes clear that any fears of Williams\u2019 partisanship are all but unwarranted.</span></p> <p><span>If anything, the benefits of Williams\u2019 involvement in presidential politics will redound to the IOP. Professors at Harvard take time off all the time to engage in research or serve in presidential administrations, and doing so furthers knowledge in their field. Professors return with new material and ideas, and few would disagree that these leaves of absence are important and essential for development in academia.</span></p> <p><span>Similarly, Williams\u2019 decision to join an active presidential transition team may strengthen rather than hamstring the IOP, as she will return with greater first-hand experience in the national political process, in addition to stronger connections o the political elite.</span></p>"}

{"title": "\u200bI\u2019m Not From Here | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>I\u2019m not from here. I grew up in the South. I went to a 1,500 person public high school just outside of Pensacola, Fla. For reference, Pensacola is about 10 minutes from the Florida-Alabama border, and nearly everyone has the \u201cFlorida Panhandle\u201d accent. Needless to say, Cambridge is different.<br></span></p> <p><span>Living in the middle of the Bible Belt, I was one of the few non-Christian kids at my school, and I was by far the most liberal. To put that in context, there was a 10,000 person Donald Trump rally in my hometown, while the Bernie Sanders rally wouldn't have filled Sanders Theater. So from the time politics became of relative importance to my peers, I was a pariah. In some class each day, what would start as a calm conversation between another kid and me about politics or religion would end with ten other kids in the class belittling me for my opinions.</span></p> <p><span>It didn\u2019t really help matters that I would seek out these confrontations, and it didn\u2019t help that I was on the football team, possibly the most conservative group on campus. Regardless, when I was accepted by Harvard, I was more than happy to leave behind my conservative roots and start fresh among people who ostensibly shared my ideals.</span></p> <p><span>I was warned about the change in climate. And I was told that the people in the North are a little colder, too\u2014the whole \u201cSouthern hospitality\u201d thing.</span></p> <p><span>But I didn\u2019t care about those warnings, because I was finally going to be around like-minded people.</span></p> <p><span>After I moved into my dorm and settled in, I was taken aback: At Harvard, I learned, people are very outspoken and very easily offended. But while this definitely surprised me, I wasn't bothered by it, because students were expressing opinions with which I at least marginally agreed. Even when my personal opinions were more complicated\u2014like with the controversy at Yale last Halloween\u2014as a white male, I didn't want to speak out of turn. I held the same philosophy towards conversations about final clubs.</span></p> <p><span>So for a while, I carried along in ambivalent naivety. People here were Democrats and that was enough. But after months of this, it hit me: Harvard is just as politically polarized as the Deep South. Obviously, in the opposite direction, but polarized nonetheless.</span></p> <p><span>What's different is that no one here seems to understand just how polarized they are. Sure, Harvard students are remarkably more knowledgeable about political issues than my friends from back home. And there are definitely exceptions to the rule. But for some reason, the inclusivity that everyone preaches only applies to those who hold a certain political ideology. Someone like myself\u2014a Democrat and a liberal\u2014becomes the subject of ridicule or exclusion when they don\u2019t staunchly support the most left-wing views. Even my teammates, some of the people on campus to whom I feel closest, frequently make fun of my \u201cconservative\u201d or \u201cpolitically incorrect\u201d beliefs, because I am not as far left as they are.</span></p> <p><span>I come from a place where I was excluded for my political beliefs. I was never taken seriously. I was told by my grandparents, close friends, teachers, and role models that my beliefs were invalid. I ventured nearly 2,000 miles away from my hometown to escape the exclusion and intolerance of different-minded people. Yet, even amongst some of the most intelligent people in the world, this attitude persisted behind the mask of acceptance.</span></p> <p><span><em>Gant Player \u201819, a psychology concentrator, lives in Eliot House. </em></span></p>"}

Looking around my beautifully heterogenous campus, only one party represents the America I know and want.</span></p> <p><span>Donald Trump is an existential threat to our country. Hillary Clinton, despite her flaws, must be elected. As a result, her presidency may be less about what she accomplishes than what she prevents, and we have an essential role to play in that prevention. Legitimate accusations of system-rigging aside, the presidential election really is decided by the votes of those who bother to show up.

And it\u2019ll hurt a lot more if your district goes to Trump because a handful of college kids were lazier than the angry high school dropouts who <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/25/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-poll/index.html\">overwhelming support</a> his demagoguery.</span></p> <p><span>Your vote counts. It\u2019s not just that Trump doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing, whereas Hillary has spent a lifetime preparing for the job (relentless ambition does have its benefits). It\u2019s that Trump\u2019s proposals, where they even exist, aren\u2019t only erratic, they\u2019re dangerously sparse.</span></p> <p><span>Take just one issue that\u2019s particularly relevant to us: education. Hillary <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/\">proposes</a> that every public university offer the privilege we already enjoy at Harvard: no tuition for families with incomes up to $125,000. Community college would be free, student debt could be favorably refinanced, entrepreneurs could defer their loans, and historically black and Latinx colleges would receive a $25 billion stimulus to remedy lasting inequality. She would pay for this with a 4 percent tax increase on the top 0.02 percent of taxpayers\u2014Americans making more than $5 million each year. Trump, meanwhile, has a single <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/issues\">51-second video</a>: \u201cI will end common core. It\u2019s a disaster.\u201d That\u2019s it. That is his entire position on education.</span></p> <p><span>This utter thoughtlessness extends to LGBTQ rights, where Trump has no position whatsoever, to immigration, where I wish he didn\u2019t have a position. It\u2019s here that Trump\u2019s hatred and the Republican platform stray furthest from the acceptable.</span></p> <p><span>You do not need to be Mexican or Muslim to feel the sting of this injustice. Xenophobia is the antithesis of American exceptionalism, for we are a nation built on immigration. When my father\u2019s grandparents fled an intolerant Russia for Ellis Island, and when my mother\u2019s ancestors settled Boston during the Puritan Migration of the 1630s, they were all immigrants. And when my mother left her home in Australia to study in the United States, she became an immigrant as well. So when I was born in Washington, D.C. in 1996, it was only because America had welcomed my ancestors for hundreds of years that I could call this country home. We must not end that generous tradition in a burst of fear.</span></p> <p><span>There are brilliant and compassionate Republicans, but this year, most are in hiding. There are two sophisticated, well-meaning mainstream parties in the United States, but this year only one showed up. On November 8, we face the clearest choice in the latest chapter of the ancient struggle between acceptance and intolerance, intelligence and incompetence, love and hate.

Pouring rain isn\u2019t usually a welcome sight for outdoor performers, but the powerhouse Haim sisters embraced the situation, responding to the rain by exuding enough energy to help a soaked crowd ignore the moisture. HAIM are a well-oiled machine live, and one that\u2019s a joy to watch. The trio never faltered, and the set built irresistibly until a climactic drum-jam punctuated the experience (lead singer and guitarist Danielle plays drums on their studio releases). HAIM played three new originals from a forthcoming album, performing them so seamlessly and with such a pointed energy that it seemed like they\u2019d been playing them for years. And of course \u201cThe Wire\u201d and \u201cFalling\u201d are even more impossible to resist dancing to live. HAIM have stepped into the spotlight, and they\u2019re an absolute pop-rock powerhouse.

Little tweaks like that made the juxtaposition of his newer, more introspective tracks and the old boisterous ones a little less jarring. There\u2019s more singing on his newest LP, \u201cGO:OD AM,\u201d and he pulled it off pretty well live.

Bernanke \u201975 and Harvard economics professor N. Gregory Mankiw on stage at the event.</span></p> <p><span>The Radcliffe Medal is an annual prize awarded to an individual \u201cwho has had a transformative impact on society,\u201d according to the Institute\u2019s website. Previous recipients of the medal include <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/5/31/ginsburg-radcliffe-medal-2015/\">Ruth Bader Ginsburg</a>, an associate justice of the Supreme Court, <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2001/6/29/albright-honored-with-radcliffe-medal-pthe/\">Madeleine K.

Yellen, who served as vice-chair of the reserve under Bernanke, lauded the reserve for its handling of the recession and said that Bernanke\u2019s leadership \u201cwas nothing short of magnificent.\u201d Still, she lamented the fact that the reserve did not foresee the recession.</span></p> <p><span>\u201dWe are really trying now to do a better job of that,\u201d Yellen said.</span></p> <p><span>Mankiw also joked there was a cohort of New York bankers who put their trip to the Hamptons on hold to see if Yellen would divulge any new information about the economy at the event, eliciting a somewhat vague announcement from Yellen.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cLet me say a few sentences, so I don\u2019t delay them much longer,\u201d Yellen said.

{"title": "Never Trump | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The ascension of Donald Trump is an <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/14/opinion/campaign-stops/why-i-will-never-vote-for-donald-trump.html\">unprecedented event</a> in American politics. But while unique in the modern era, the rise of an outsider, nationalist-populist candidate is not necessarily surprising. Its roots lie in the growing disconnect (both cultural and economic) between the elite, college-educated denizens of so-called \u201cSuperZIP\u201d cities like Washington, New York, and San Francisco and the working-class residents of the rest of America. Out of touch politicians and culture-shapers <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w19829\">surround themselves</a> with only people of similar backgrounds and educations and then arrogantly believe they alone are wise and righteous enough to consolidate power and control the future of our nation.</span></p> <p><span>As two conservatives who went to college at an institution that serves as a feeder for these enclaves, we think working class Americans are right to be frustrated by their government. Both Republicans and Democrats alike seem increasingly unconcerned about and ignorant of the issues most important to the middle class, be it <a href=\"http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/images/mobility_trends.pdf\">stagnant paychecks</a> or <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/national/2016/04/08/we-dont-know-why-it-came-to-this/\">social disintegration</a> of their communities, even as the expanse and reach of the federal government continues to grow unchecked. These problems cannot be solved on high by Washington politicians who think they know best. We firmly believe it\u2019s time for the Republican Party to start listening. Politicians ought to ask why they are <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGWFhd5mIZQ\">so despised by the people</a>. The only appropriate response to such a clear statement of disillusionment by Americans is to empathize with their concerns and begin the long process of change.</span></p> <p><span>Nonetheless, as our party begins to humbly turn itself towards a platform and disposition more responsive to middle-class Americans, we implore our fellow Republicans: However frustrated you are by Washington politicians, please do not support Donald Trump in November. Whatever your sympathies to certain of his policies, he is morally bankrupt and so unfit for office that to support him would be a grave mistake. (We hasten to add: Hillary Clinton is no better. We advocate voting third-party or writing in a candidate like Senator Ben Sasse).</span></p> <p><span>To begin with, Donald Trump stands against the core principles that we (<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/17/opinion/have-evangelicals-who-support-trump-lost-their-values.html\">specifically as Christians</a>, but also, we believe, as Americans) hold as truths, both in his rhetoric and in his behavior. A man of countless contradictions and flip-flops, Trump is tellingly consistent only in his lying, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/01/28/upshot/donald-trump-twitter-insults.html\">hateful style</a> of speech, and <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/27/politics/ben-sasse-donald-trump-affairs-salesman-iowa/\">unrepentant serial adultery</a>. He believes the worth of a human is determined by that person\u2019s success, achievement, and power\u2014even his answer on why he changed views on abortion <a href=\"http://thefederalist.com/2015/08/10/donald-trumps-abortion-pivot/\">misunderstands</a> the fundamental value of all human life. A vote for Donald Trump is not just a vote to surrender on, but to actively oppose, everything for which social conservatives have fought for decades.</span></p> <p><span>Second, a vote for Donald Trump is dangerous. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sassefornebraska/posts/561073597391141\">Trump\u2019s instinct is tyrannical</a>. He would continue the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to illegally expand the executive branch and administrative state. Even without the trappings of the executive branch, Trump views himself as a king, not a servant leader, and acts accordingly. His praise of <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-north-korean-leader-kim-jong-gotta-give/story?id=36198345\">Kim Jong-Un</a>, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/12/trump-praises-putin-216929\">Vladimir Putin</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/432036/donald-trump-tiananmen-square\">China\u2019s atrocity in Tiananmen Square</a> show that he worships power. To vote for Trump would be to give a pompous egotist the nuclear codes.</span></p> <p><span>Finally, it\u2019s worth remembering that, contrary to the <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/05/16/trump-and-clinton-the-two-worst-things-that-could-happen-to-america-commentary.html\">advice</a> of <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-third-party-temptation-1462231680\">many</a> journalistic elites, the act of voting is not simply a strategic choice between only two candidates. Particularly for conservatives who, like us, are <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/11/05/as-gop-celebrates-win-no-sign-of-narrowing-gender-age-gaps/\">younger</a> than the median Republican, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/08/opinion/sunday/the-conservative-case-against-trump.html\">voting is a multi-period exercise</a>. A vote sends a message not only about a voter's preferences in the current election, but also about whom he or she views as an acceptable candidate to future voters and potential candidates. Sometimes the choices are so bad, the candidates so deplorable, that one must send the message that she cannot in good conscience support either major party's nominee. Not voting for Trump or Clinton sends the message that we demand better options, and that we will not blindly support any candidate who happens to have an \u201cR\u201d next to his name on the ballot.</span></p> <p><span>Moreover, before its consequentialist implications, we believe voting is, at its core, an <a href=\"http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/resources/politics/voting/voting-by-conscience/\">act of conscience</a>. <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/05/where-republicans-stand-on-donald-trump-a-cheat-sheet/481449/\">Some conservatives</a> argue that to support Trump is to support the lesser of two evils. We agree that Hillary Clinton would be a terrible president. But voting is a positive act\u2014by pulling the lever for Trump, you are first endorsing him before making any kind of statement about the alternatives. We believe that voting for a candidate requires that candidate exceed a certain absolute bar of qualifications and fitness for office. Evaluated soberly, neither Clinton nor Trump can rationally be said to meet the standard to which Republicans ought to hold their candidates.</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps most important of all, \u201clesser-of-two-evils\u201d logic has its limits. Imagine a hypothetical (and clearly post-apocalyptic) world in which the only two major-party candidates for president were Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. Would reluctantly pro-Trump conservatives really cast a vote for Warren to keep Sanders out of the White House? How can one even decide between the lesser of those two evils? Sometimes the lesser of two evils is still too evil to support.</span></p> <p><span>Republican politicians deserve a significant portion of the blame for Trump\u2019s rise. But now that he is the presumptive nominee, it is incumbent upon every Republican to embrace his or her Burkean duty to act in the face of encroaching evil. We can be silent appeasers no more. And so we say: We will not vote for Trump. Not today, not ever. And neither should you.</span></p> <p><span><br></span></p> <p><span><em>Colin J. Motley \u201910 and Caleb L.

Clinton, and supporters on both sides say the debate on campus has been collegial, in contrast to recent media portrayals.</span></p> <p><span>This Sunday, the Guardian published an article entitled, \u201c'<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/08/harvard-students-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-2016-election\">I've been silent': Harvard's Clinton backers face life on a pro-Bernie campus</a>.\u201d The story characterized Harvard\u2019s notoriously liberal student body as overwhelmingly in favor of the Sanders, and suppressing of pro-Clinton voices. Included in the article are quotes from three undergraduate Clinton supporters, two of whom reported feeling challenged by Sanders supporters. It followed a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/30/opinion/an-outlier-at-harvard-im-a-hillary-supporter.html\">letter to the editor</a> published in the New York Times by Sam H. Koppelman \u201918, a Clinton supporter and Crimson Magazine and Editorial editor, in which Koppelman wrote, \u201cI\u2019m a Hillary supporter. In their eyes, I might as well be a College Republican.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>However, undergraduate Democrats said both characterizations misstated the political climate on campus.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard College Democrats President and Hillary Clinton supporter Susan X. Wang \u201917 said she was \u201csurprised\u201d to see Harvard\u2019s Clinton supporters categorized as silenced by Sanders supporters. She said she has not felt the Clinton-Sanders tension the article conveys, although she noted others may have had different experiences.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI personally do support Clinton and have never experienced the things that this article talks about,\u201d Wang said, referring to the story in the Guardian. \u201cMost of the people that I\u2019ve talked to say that they can engage in pretty good conversations with people who do not support their primary candidate at this time. It\u2019s not a big deal and is pretty respectful.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Wang is not alone in her surprise about the article\u2014even the sources quoted in the story said they reject the notion that Harvard\u2019s Clinton supporters are victims in any way.  Koppelman, who was quoted in the Guardian story after his New York Times letter to the editor, said he \u201crejects the narrative of victimization\u201d presented in the Guardian article.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAs a white, straight, cis-gendered male, I am in no way shape or form a victim. The idea that Hillary supporters are in any way subjugated, persecuted or victimized is absolutely absurd,\u201d Koppelman said. \u201cThe point of me talking about this issue was to try and bring about unity and it was not in any way coming from a place of victimization or vulnerability.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Janet Ho \u201919, another source quoted in the Guardian story, said she also rejects the notion that Clinton supporters on campus are silenced.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHarvard remains an environment in which everyone is free to debate ideas in a climate of civility and mutual respect,\u201d Ho wrote in an email. \u201cI strongly disagree with the notion that Hillary supporters feel the need to remain \u2018silent\u2019 about their views.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Sanders proponents also sought to quell the notion that there was an acrimonious divide between Clinton and Sanders supporters on campus. Justin G. Curtis \u201819, vice president of Harvard Students for Bernie, said there was \u201cno animosity whatsoever\u201d between Harvard\u2019s student organizations for Clinton and Sanders.</span></p> <p><span>Curtis also said he was confident that given the Republican\u2019s expected nomination of Donald Trump, Harvard\u2019s liberals will unite in November to support the Democratic nominee, no matter which candidate prevails. Curtis further noted that the past two presidents of the Harvard College Democrats are Clinton supporters themselves, calling into question whether there is truly a lack of public Clinton support.</span></p> <p><span>Along with surprise and skepticism, the Guardian article faced criticism on social media, and a <a href=\"http://harvardpolitics.com/harvard/not-silent-clinton-supporters-harvard/\">Harvard Political Review article</a> rebutting the narrative. Kim F. Soffen \u201916, an author of the HPR article, said local voter records from the Massachusetts Democratic Primary indicated Clinton had strong local backing, given she won all the precincts where Harvard students commonly vote.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAs people who are pretty tapped into the political scene at Harvard, this is not what we have observed at all,\u201d Soffen said referring to herself and co-writer Colin J.F.

{"title": "Making Voting Easier | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>As this year\u2019s strange and unpredictable presidential campaign winds its way to the summer conventions, the importance of voting has never been clearer. Around the country, however, this most fundamental of rights is under siege. The Supreme Court\u2019s 2013 decision to gut the Voting Rights Act has allowed states <a href=\"http://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/shelby-county-one-year-later\">like</a> Texas and North Carolina to pass restrictive voting measures that disproportionately disenfranchise voters of color. For a country that has struggled to encourage adequate levels voter <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2014/11/10/voter-turnout-in-2014-was-the-lowest-since-wwii/\">turnout</a> and seen historical injustices weigh heavily on certain communities, these new laws are particularly counterproductive.</span></p> <p><span>Fortunately, several states have been moving in the opposite direction. Oregon, for example, set a strong example for the rest of the country last year when it passed an automatic voter registration law. Under the Oregon <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-oregon-automatic-voter-registration-20150317-story.html\">model</a>, anyone who applies for a driver's license or another form of state ID is automatically registered to vote, unless they choose to opt out. California <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/local/political/la-me-pc-gov-brown-on-motor-voter-bill-20150917-story.html\">gave</a> the go-ahead to a similar system this past October. Thanks to the efforts of the New Democracy Coalition and state Representative Evandro C. Carvalho, Massachusetts state legislators <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/01/29/group-pushes-for-automatic-voter-registration-mass/iJqZlbeHJEDqwPxAFi6LUM/story.html\">have</a> a chance to join their Oregonian and Californian counterparts in making voting easier. It is an opportunity they should take.</span></p> <p><span>As the New Democracy Coalition\u2019s founder, Kevin C. Peterson, told the Boston Globe, the adoption of such a measure would be a key statement in an era of voter suppression. Massachusetts should be a leader on this issue, and Representative Carvalho\u2019s bill would expand on other states\u2019 designs by creating a database of eligible voters from multiple sources, including public universities\u2014an acknowledgement of the significant role that young people should play in the democratic process. Peterson has also <a href=\"http://commonwealthmagazine.org/politics/the-case-for-automatic-voter-registration/\">argued</a> convincingly that automatic voter registration will reduce the costs associated with paper registration forms and decrease fraud because of the existence of a centralized database.</span></p> <p><span>This last point is especially crucial, as opponents of automatic registration have often <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chris-christie-automatic-registration_us_5640d98ce4b0307f2cae3e5e\">cited</a> fraud as a concern. Just as in <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2016/mar/17/greg-abbott/light-match-greg-abbotts-claim-about-rampant-voter/\">the debate</a> over voter ID laws, the fraud argument is a red herring. In reality, automatic voter registration has the potential to eliminate the small amount of fraud that does exist while also expanding access and lowering the initial psychological barrier to voter participation.</span></p> <p><span>One of the sad side-effects of the turn towards voter suppression is that truly creative attempts to expand voting have faltered. Massachusetts could help reverse this trend by creating an automatic registration system, but government at all levels should think bigger. One of the greatest injustices of American elections is that most voting takes place on a Tuesday, which can <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2015/08/05/news/economy/poor-people-voting-rights/\">force</a> voters to choose between work and having a say in government. Making election day a national holiday\u2014something supported by <a href=\"http://www.sanders.senate.gov/democracyday\">Bernie Sanders</a> and <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/the-briefing/fact-sheet-voting-rights/\">Hillary Clinton</a>\u2014would ensure that all Americans can exercise their rights without economic consequences.</span></p>"}

In his speech, titled \u201cDe Puellis Radcliffiensibus,\u201d or as it is translated in English, \u201cRadcliffe Women,\u201d Weld sardonically explained how Lamont Library was  \u201cthe last bastion of Harvard men\u201d to escape the \u201cRadcliffe onslaught.\u201d At the time, women were not allowed in Lamont, and debate <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1966/12/8/lamont-will-open-to-cliffies-after/\">raged </a>a<a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1966/12/8/lamont-will-open-to-cliffies-after/\">bout </a>whether or not to lift this restriction.</span></p> <p><span>According to friends, this speech, the capstone of Weld\u2019s collegiate career, encapsulated his wit and intelligence. </span></p> <p><span>Before Weld became a two-term governor of Massachusetts, and the 2016 Libertarian Vice Presidential nominee,  he was better known to his friends as \u201cBill,\u201d the  clever undergraduate with a biting sense of humor.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHis intellectual and personal confidence raised my eyebrows,\u201d Nicholas B. Deane \u201966, a classmate and fellow member of the Signet Society for arts, said.  \u201cHe expressed it through being pretty sharp tongued about things and people.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In the classroom, Weld, who studied Latin and Greek as a Classics concentrator, excelled. He was one of only 45 students to graduate summa cum laude,  the highest  level of academic distinction. Even more, Weld, who could not be reached for an interview, was one of only eight students in his year to be elected as a junior to Phi Beta Kappa for his outstanding academic achievements.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe was a brilliant fellow but very discrete about it,\u201d Weld\u2019s classmate and fellow Adams resident Francisco R.R. de Sola \u201966 said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t someone who would go around trumpeting his incredible intelligence.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><strong></strong></span></p> <p><span>Outside of the classroom, Weld was highly active in campus social life as a member of the final club the Fly, the Signet society, and the Hasty Pudding Theatricals, an all-male drag troupe famous for its burlesque productions.</span></p> <p><span>While Weld was a dedicated scholar, he, like most college students, wasn\u2019t always perfectly studious. As Mitchell L. Adams \u201966, who was the president of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals, remembers, two weeks before senior theses were due, Weld still hadn\u2019t started his.</span></p> <p><span>Still, Weld did not let his role as a \u201cleading lady,\u201d playing the character \u201cVera Similitude\u201d in the 1966 Pudding Production, \u201cRight Up Your Alley,\u201d get in the way of his academic pursuits. Adams said Weld balanced his responsibilities by writing his thesis underneath the stage during the show in between his scenes.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI\u2019ll never forget the sight of Bill in between scenes in the Pudding show that spring,\u201d said  Adams. \u201cThere he was by himself in dress and wig with a legal pad on his lap writing his thesis, which turned out to be a Summa.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Aris M. Sophocles \u201966, also a Pudding cast member, added that Weld was extroverted. Sophocles recalled a particularly vivid memory of Weld, who at that time had bright red hair, enthusiastically participating in the kick line during several Pudding shows.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe had lots of humor and enjoyed our silliness,\u201d Sophocles said. \u201cHe had a lot of fun with the rest of us.\"</span></p> <p><span>Fellow members of the Fly Club also warmly remember their time with Weld.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe were all really fond of Bill, he really added alot to the cohesiveness of the [Fly],\u201d Adams said.</span></p> <p><span><strong></strong></span></p> <p><span>Though Weld was involved in a series of extracurricular organizations, he did not participate in any politically-orientated clubs. Several of Weld\u2019s friends were surprised by his postgraduate career choice.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIn college, I can\u2019t recall him being particularly politically active,\u201d Adams said. \u201cIt never occurred to me at the time that Bill would go into politics.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Sophocles echoed this surprise. \u201cI really didn\u2019t think he would go into politics,\u201d Sophocles said. \u201cBut, since he did, I\u2019m not at all surprised he became governor.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>De Sola, however, remarked that he always suspected that Weld would pursue a career in politics, a field that would draw on Weld\u2019s theatrical abilities.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe had that ability to deal with people, a great ability with words, and an aim to make the world better,\u201d de Sola said.</span></p> <p><span>After graduating from Harvard, Weld attended the University of Oxford on a year-long fellowship program, before returning to complete a degree at Harvard Law School. After graduating in 1970,Weld began his legal career as minority counsel to the House Judiciary Committee during the Watergate impeachment inquiries.</span></p> <p><span>In 1981, Weld was appointed United States Attorney for Massachusetts by President Ronald Reagan. He later worked in the Justice Department before being elected governor of Massachusetts in November 1990.</span></p> <p><span>Weld served two terms as governor, before vacating his seat to pursue an appointment by President Clinton as Ambassador of China. After the Senate failed to confirm his appointment, Weld served  in various positions within government and, most recently, running as the Vice Presidential nominee for the 2016 Libertarian Party ticket</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff Writer Laszlo B.

{"title": "H is for Hillary | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "William C. Skinner", "body": "<p><span>On a cold Saturday morning in February, more than 50 Harvard College Democrats bussed up to New Hampshire to rally support for their preferred candidate ahead of the state\u2019s first-in-the-nation primary. Trudging through the snow, they knocked on doors and <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/2/8/democrats-canvass-new-hampshire/\">canvassed voters</a> alongside other Boston-area college students.</span></p> <p><span>But while the Harvard undergraduates who traveled that day were split among supporters of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and former Secretary of State Hillary R. Clinton, a survey of Harvard seniors conducted by The Crimson revealed they prefer Clinton over Sanders.</span></p> <p><span>Clinton continues to lead the race for delegates in the campaign for the Democratic nomination. Along the way, she has benefited from high levels of support among Harvard students, the overwhelming majority of <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/2/10/faculty-donate-clinton-2016/\">Harvard faculty\u2019s political contributions</a>, and the expertise of a significant number of alumni working for her campaign as senior staffers.</span></p> <p><span>The ties between Harvard and Hillary run remarkably deep.</span></p> <p><span>A recent article in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/08/harvard-students-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-2016-election\">the Guardian</a> characterized Harvard\u2019s campus political climate as silencing for supporters of Clinton, but a number of students advocating for America\u2019s former top diplomat to become the first female president said that is simply <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/5/11/Guardian-characterizes-campus-politics/\">not the case</a>.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard has an <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/2/19/2016-primaries-student-groups/\">active organization</a>, Harvard Students for Hillary, which has held phone banks and run canvassing trips to support Clinton throughout the election cycle. Matthew Moore \u201919, a coordinator for the group, said the national campaign welcomed their efforts.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe campaign did look kindly upon us because we tended to reach the goals that we set out,\u201d Moore said.</span></p> <p><span>Many of the group\u2019s student leaders over the past year are working for the campaign this summer, but declined to comment for this article, citing a campaign policy against speaking to the press. Student supporters not directly involved with the campaign this summer said they remain excited about the likelihood of her securing the Democratic nomination.</span></p> <p><span>Jacob R. Carrel \u201916, former president of the College Democrats, said members of the student group were split evenly among supporters of Clinton and Sanders. However, he said he actively supports her candidacy and that \u201ca lot of members of the Harvard community respect her leadership ability and domestic and foreign policy experience.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Data from The Crimson\u2019s annual Senior Survey shows that within the ranks of the Class of 2016, Clinton enjoys strong and remarkably broad support among students, surpassing that of Sanders.  Over 800 seniors participated in the survey.</span></p> <p><span>According to the survey, 66 percent of senior respondents who voted in this year\u2019s Democratic primaries cast their ballots for Clinton, compared to 33 percent who voted for Bernie Sanders.</span></p> <p><span>As Donald J. Trump has emerged as the Republican Party\u2019s presumptive nominee, the survey revealed that Harvard students who voted for Republicans in the primary have swung to the left and thrown their support behind Clinton.</span></p> <p><span>Among the three remaining presidential candidates of Sanders, Clinton, and Trump, 67 percent of respondents said they preferred Clinton. This increase, however, does not appear to come from Bernie Sanders\u2019 primary supporters, as he was the preferred candidate of 28 percent of respondents, about the same number who reported they preferred him in the primary matchup among all candidates.</span></p> <p><span>Fifty-seven percent of respondents who supported former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney as the GOP presidential nominee in the 2012, the first election in which most members of the class had the opportunity to vote, plan on voting for Hillary Clinton in 2016.</span></p> <p><span>Clinton\u2019s support on Harvard\u2019s campus is high, but it is comparable to support among millennials across the country, according to a <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/4/26/iop-spring-2016-millennial-poll/\">national poll</a> conducted by the Harvard Institute of Politics this spring. Likely voters between the ages of 18-29 favored Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump in a general election 61 to 25 percent, with 14 percent still undecided, the poll found.</span></p> <p><span><strong></strong></span></p> <p><span>While many Harvard students have expressed their support for Clinton, the ties between Harvard and Hillary are even stronger among the University\u2019s graduates and faculty.</span></p> <p><span>Clinton enjoys the almost unchallenged financial backing of faculty who donate to presidential campaigns, and she has drawn on the University\u2019s alumni to fill top spots in her campaign. At the same time as Clinton enjoys faculty and alumni support, Harvard has also benefited by hiring former top staffers who served with Hillary or in Bill Clinton\u2019s presidential administration. </span></p> <p><span>An <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/2/10/faculty-donate-clinton-2016/\">analysis conducted by The Crimson</a> found that 91 percent of contributions to current presidential candidates made by Harvard faculty, instructors, and researchers in 2015 went to Clinton.</span></p> <p><span>Former top staffers who served with Hillary or in Bill Clinton\u2019s presidential administration have also served in leading roles at Harvard. The Director of the Institute of Politics is <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/6/6/williams-new-iop-director/\">Margaret A. \u201cMaggie\u201d Williams</a>, a former top Clinton adviser and manager of her 2008 presidential campaign. Bill Clinton\u2019s Treasury Secretary, Lawrence H. Summers, led Harvard as President and is currently a professor. Former Dean of the Kennedy School <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2004/6/10/david-t-ellwood-75-clinton-administration/\">David T. Ellwood \u201975</a> was a senior official in the Clinton administration\u2019s antipoverty effort, and Economics professor David M. Cutler '87 served on Bill Clinton\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers and in the National Economic Council.</span></p> <p><span>The road between the Clintons and Harvard goes both ways. When Hillary Clinton began assembling her core campaign staff in 2014, she tapped a number of Harvard alumni to lead the charge to the White House. Madeleine \u201cMandy\u201d Grunwald \u201979, a longtime Clinton ally and Democratic media strategist, was chosen as Clinton\u2019s senior adviser for communications. Working beside Grunwald on the campaign\u2019s communications staff is Brian E. Fallon Jr. \u201903, Clinton\u2019s national press secretary.</span></p> <p><span>Some of Clinton\u2019s top political and digital strategists also have Harvard degrees. Amanda A. Renteria, a Business School graduate, serves as the campaign\u2019s political director. As Clinton built out her digital strategy, she called on another Business School graduate, Stephanie K. Hannon, to serve as the campaign\u2019s chief technology officer. Also on the technology side, Nellwyn A. \u201cNell\u201d Thomas \u201905 serves as director of digital analytics.</span></p> <p><span>Among the lower ranks of the campaign\u2019s large apparatus, recent Harvard College graduates have filled spots with the potential hope of working their way up the ladder and into a Hillary Clinton administration. Daniel R. Ki \u201915, Ross C. Svenson \u201915, and Valentina I. Perez \u201915, all former leaders within the Democratic community during their time as undergraduates, joined the Clinton campaign after graduating. They later moved on to roles in the New Hampshire Democratic Party, Pennsylvania Democratic Party, and Hillary for America Brooklyn headquarters, respectively.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer William C.

{"title": "The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><em>Walter S. Isaacson \u201974 has been President and CEO of the Aspen Institute since 2004. Isaacson, a native of New Orleans, graduated cum laude from Harvard College in 1974 and from Pembroke College, Oxford, where he was a Rhodes Scholar. Upon graduating from Oxford, Isaacson entered a career in journalism, becoming managing editor of TIME Magazine in 1996 and chairman and CEO of CNN in 2001. Isaacson has authored several best-selling books, including biographies of Benjamin Franklin, Albert Einstein, and Steve Jobs. Isaacson has served on the Board of Overseers of Harvard since 2010.</em></span></p> <p><span><strong>Fifteen Minutes: As a result of the social media revolution, Americans now have the opportunity to see more dimensions of political candidates than ever before. Do you believe that these changes have improved or tarnished the overall democratic process?</strong></span></p> <p><span>Walter Isaacson: I think that a couple of decades ago, reporters were actually able to get a more intimate and closer look at candidates. They weren't shielded off by ropes and herded into pens. They were able to have long dinners and background conversations with the candidates. Now candidates are very guarded, and a smart person like Hillary Clinton seems always on guard about making what Michael Kinsley called the Washington definition of a gaffe, which is when you accidentally tell the truth about what you really think. So I think it's been a mixed blessing. What's been particularly good about social media is that it allows everybody to be both a reporter and a commentator rather than the old media way of a few gatekeepers controlling what got reported and said.</span></p> <p><span><strong>FM: Do you believe that the media is to blame for the political gridlock and polarization that has developed in the United States over the last decade?</strong></span></p> <p><span>WI: I think it's partly true. I think that both the technology and the approach of media tends to divide us as a nation into ideological camps more than it did in the past generation. It used to be that there'd be three nightly newscasts, three news magazines, and an anchor who would say \"That's the way it is,\" and we would have a general sharing of information. There was a downside to that which is an elite media establishment got to decide what to tell people. But nowadays, you can get your political biases reinforced by going to some edge of the talk radio dial, some cable news show, or some corner of the blogosphere where you hear mainly people who have the same ideology as you do. So that's been one of a dozen factors that has caused a political polarization in this country and led to paralysis in government.</span></p> <p><span>There are many other factors such as gerrymandering or the role of money in politics. But if you're trying to appeal to a broad center of the electorate, you realize that, as Benjamin Franklin said, \"Compromisers may not make great heroes, but they do make great democracies.\" That compromise is a lubricant for getting things done. We have paralysis now because whether it's in the media or in the way our primary system chooses candidates, people get pilloried for being willing to compromise rather than praised.</span></p> <p><span><strong>FM: In recent years, there has been a lot of media attention surrounding hyper-political correctness and the need for \u201csafe spaces\u201d on college campuses. What are your thoughts on this trend?</strong></span></p> <p><span>WI: I don't think it's anything new. Whether it was the Puritan theologians at Harvard in the 17th century, or the period of the 1950s when there was McCarthyism, or when I went to college in the 1970s, there were a lot of battles over free speech. I think that President Faust along with President Summers have stood firmly and clearly in favor of the value of free speech.</span></p> <p><span>The controversies now are real, but they seem more minor than the ones you had during the McCarthy era and the Civil Rights era and the Vietnam War era. That said, we have to make sure that a campus is a place where all viewpoints get heard, because one of the roles of a university is to expose people to a diversity of ideas, including ideas that may make them feel uncomfortable.</span></p> <p><span>On the flip side, what some people decry as political correctness is partly just people being asked to be polite and not use language that may have been used in the locker rooms when I was a student and that people find demeaning. I think people who try to enforce political correctness and people who flap their arms too much about political correctness both need to be a little bit more sensitive to the rights and feelings of others.</span></p> <p><span>I would think among the goals of a great university are to instill empathy, to teach the virtues of collaboration, and to prepare you for a world filled with diversity and the need to work well with others. The debates you see on campus now are actually healthy, because it shows people wrestling with these issues what they're going to face in the real world.</span></p> <p><span><strong>FM: On the topic of education, over the last decade, the arts and humanities have often taken a back seat to STEM fields at leading universities across country. At Harvard, you studied History and Literature. You\u2019ve since become an important advocate for the humanities as well as a leader in the study of the technology and innovation. In your view, why should young people study the humanities in the 21st century?</strong></span></p> <p><span>WI: The greatest creativity has come from the people who are able to stand at the intersection of the humanities and the sciences, from Leonardo da Vinci to Steve Jobs. I'm looking across my room at a print of the Vitruvian Man, the famous Leonardo drawing of the man doing jumping jacks in the circle and square. That is an example and a symbol of art and science connecting. When you ask Steve Jobs what set him apart as the great genius of the personal computer age, he would say it was his ability to realize that beauty mattered, that design was key and that connecting a feel for the humanities with engineering set Apple apart from any other company.</span></p> <p><span>In the past 50 years of the digital revolution, [innovation] has been largely driven by engineering breakthroughs. But now we're seeing a next phase in which innovation depends on human creativity, on having the imagination and the sense of humanities that can't be replicated merely in an algorithm or a machine. So that creativity, which will drive the next phase of the biotech and digital tech revolution, comes from having a feel for history, morality, art, and human sensibility. That comes from understanding the magic of the connection of the humanities to technology.</span></p> <p><span><strong>FM: Up until about a month ago, you were arguably the most famous member of the Harvard College class of 1974. Now America's eyes are on a different member, your friend and fellow D.C. resident, Judge Merrick B. Garland \u201974. Tell me a little bit about your relationship with Judge Garland.</strong></span></p> <p><span>WI: First of all, I will not accept your premise that I was particularly famous\u2026 or as distinguished as Merrick. Merrick has always had a profound sense of moral purpose combined with open mindedness. He would be the perfect Supreme Court Justice. He is, I guess, the highest thing you can aspire to after a lot of learning: to process it into wisdom based on values. That's what Merrick has done in his life, unlike most of us, who have merely aspired to [that].</span></p> <p><span><strong>FM: Despite living in D.C., you've remained deeply involved with your hometown, New Orleans. Since Katrina, the city has faced myriad issues, and its recovery has been a slow process. What is your outlook for the future of the city?</strong></span></p> <p><span>WI: After Katrina, when we were trying to convince everybody to come back home and that we would be able to rebuild, Wynton Marsalis came down from New York on the bus of his band and gave a talk. He said there was nothing like a hurricane to remind you of the value of home, because what we call home forms the essence of who we are. The essence of New Orleans is a city that, for more than 300 years, has been a gumbo pot of diversity. French and Spanish and Americans and slaves and freed slaves and Creoles and Haitians and Vietnamese have come to a port city and mixed and mingled with all the friction that can cause.</span></p> <p><span>But what New Orleans teaches us is that diversity promotes creativity. It leads to jazz. When the Spanish American War veterans honk their trumpets and bring their march tunes to a place where there are drummers in Congo Square and the French Opera House, and ragtime orchestras and slave spirituals and blues coming down from the plantations... That mix creates something new. It's true of the food; it's true of the mindset. If we are going to be successful in the 21st century, it is going to be those communities and countries that are comfortable with ethnic and racial and ideological diversity versus those that end up in sectarian civil wars. To that extent, New Orleans is not just home to me, but an example of what we're striving to create in order to be both a creative society and a civil society.</span></p>"}

I\u2019ll mention in passing that in Iran, all candidates for president must similarly garner the approval of the Guardian Council, which is composed of six highly esteemed and well-credentialed worthies. \u201cThat\u2019s much more undemocratic,\u201d you may protest. Sure, but only seven times as much.</span></p> <p><span>Another quirk of our democracy is the delightfully quaint caucus system, which requires voters to take a few hours out of their evenings and argue the merits of their preferred candidates in a room full of neighbors, rather than merely casting their vote and being done with the matter. Only the most motivated voters seem to turn up to these lengthy shows of Rousseauian democracy, but even more byzantine procedures can nullify even the votes of even these most dedicated of partisans.</span></p> <p><span>In the Democratic Iowa caucuses, perhaps the most important, votes are <a href=\"http://www.whyiowa.org/Why%20Iowa%20Chapter%203.pdf\">discarded</a> if a candidate does not meet a 15 percent threshold. A number of <a href=\"http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2016/02/02/sometimes-iowa-democrats-award-caucus-delegates-coin-flip/79680342/\">ties</a> this year were even decided by coin toss. For a party that vigorously campaigns against the vote-suppressing laws that have cropped up in some Republican-led states, the Democrats' retention of caucuses remains a bizarre outcrop from the party-boss days that essentially disenfranchises entire classes of voters arbitrarily. Caucuses should go the way of superdelegates\u2014straight to the dustbin of history.</span></p> <p><span>In spite of what I will lovingly call America\u2019s \u201cinstitutional eccentricities,\u201d most electoral processes manage to select the candidate whom the actual majority voted for. That\u2019s because massive margins of victory are difficult to squirrel away behind superdelegate disdain or caucus shenanigans. But in tightly-contested races, such as today\u2019s, the anti-democratic pull of these idiosyncrasies can come to dominate, leaving the outcome to either dumb luck or campaign savviness with superficial technicalities. That\u2019s how our hopelessly antiquated, but constitutionally enshrined, Electoral College gave us George Bush over Al Gore, who won the popular vote.</span></p> <p><span>Unlike the Electoral College, reformation of the party nominating process would not require a constitutional amendment. Of course, possibility of reform is a far cry from its realization, as any non-comatose political observer would tell you. According to Brookings, there are at least <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2016/01/25-primaries-mess-kamarck/primaries.pdf\">153 actors</a>\u2014when you take into account all the state parties and legislatures\u2014who split control over our current primary process and \u201cabsent some sort of meltdown, a more rational system is not likely any time soon.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>And that\u2019s where Donald Trump might amount to some good after all. \u201cOur Republican system is absolutely rigged. It\u2019s a phony deal,\u201d the self-styled master dealmaker angrily <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/trump-our-republican-system-is-absolutely-rigged/2016/04/12/d162fc56-00f4-11e6-8bb1-f124a43f84dc_video.html\">called</a> out on Tuesday. He\u2019s absolutely right, for once: Republican leaders are all but openly scheming to steal the nomination from Trump if he does not win an absolute majority of delegates, though he is almost certain to win a commanding plurality.</span></p> <p><span>As we\u2019ve seen, in a contested convention, an increasing number of delegates become \u201cunbound\u201d to their state\u2019s primary and caucus results with each round, presumably spoiling the chances of Trump in favor of Ted Cruz or even an unnamed white knight. This of course would make a mockery of the many millions of Republican primary voters. Democracy ought to be about giving people want they want\u2014even if it\u2019s someone as distasteful as Trump.

{"title": "The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><em>Attorney General Maura Healey '92 is the highest ranking Democrat in an elected position in the State of Massachusetts. She began her term on Jan. 21, 2015 and has taken on issues ranging from transgender rights to student debt. After speaking in the Kirkland House Senior Common room, Attorney General Healey sat down with FM to chat about her first year in office. </em></span></p> <p><span><strong>Fifteen Minutes: </strong><strong>Who\u2019s someone you greatly admire, and do you think you emulate yourself after that person in some way?</strong><br></span></p> <p><span>Maura Healey: I admire Hilary Clinton for what she has done in her life and her career. What she\u2019s withstood, the ways in which she\u2019s been tested, her perseverance, her intelligence, and her willingness  really from the time she was in college to commit to public service and to try to make a difference in people\u2019s lives. So, she\u2019s somebody who I deeply admire and it\u2019s why I\u2019m working hard in hopes that she becomes president.</span></p> <p><span><strong>FM: You played basketball at Harvard. What do you think athletics taught you? And how do you use the skills you gained in athletics in your job today?</strong></span></p> <p><span>MH: Basketball is a team game, and I learned a lot about teamwork, discipline, hard-work, practice is what it\u2019s all about....You are going to lose, you are going to win. But there are lessons in all of that. I probably learned more from losing than I ever did from winning. But I think with sports and athletics, there\u2019s a chance to work as a team, have a goal, commit to something, and work hard to achieve it. It helped me tremendously in the campaign, in the way we built our grassroots campaign and ran our campaign. It was intense, had a lot of energy.... To me, it helped having had those experiences playing sports. Leaving the Attorney General\u2019s office here in Massachusetts, those are lessons that I draw upon constantly, again about teamwork and collaborating, and having goals, and driving forward with an agenda. It\u2019s important to me, and also it was a part of my life that was fun. I had a lot of passion for basketball. I think it\u2019s important to keep something in your life no matter how old you get, or what you are doing, to keep something going in your life that gives you joy and fun.</span></p> <p><span><strong>FM: What do you think your biggest accomplishment has been since you took office over a year ago?</strong></span></p> <p><span>MH: I\u2019ve just got an amazing team of people in that office that work so hard and bring energy every day to so many different issues, working to combat the heroin and opioid crisis, addressing issues of domestic violent and sexual assault, taking on student loan debt, fighting against healthcare costs. You name it. One of the things I really am pleased with this year is that we started a community engagement division. For us to be the people\u2019s lawyer, people\u2019s law firm, we need to be present in neighborhoods and communities across this state. So we started a community engagement division, Rodrigo [Plaza \u201913] is part of that division, and we are out in the neighborhoods, at events, hosting community action hours in multiple languages, where people can come with their complaints. If you got a civil rights complaint, if you got an employment complaint, if you feel like you\u2019ve been taken advantage of by a car dealership, or an insurance company that you are dealing with isn\u2019t being fair to you, bring us your complaints and we\u2019ve got lawyers and mediators right there on the spot in those community action hours to serve people of the state. I\u2019m really pleased about that.</span></p> <p><span><strong>FM: Changing gears slightly, what have you done specifically to help student with debt over the last year? </strong></span></p> <p><span>MH: Well, we have, as an office, made this a top priority because student debt is $1.3 trillion and growing right now in the country. It exceeds, I think, all forms of debt that are out there. This is going to have a crippling effect on our economy if we don\u2019t get this under control. Already, so many students and families are just crushed under the weight of debt, and it\u2019s limiting their life-choices and options and it\u2019s really terrible. So we\u2019ve done a few things. One, we\u2019ve worked really hard to get after predatory for-profit schools. We\u2019ve gone after unlawful student loan servicing practices, unlawful student loan debt practices. And we\u2019ve worked really hard to advocate that the U.S. Department of Justice provide discharges for student loans where students were taken advantage of by some of these practices. My team has been leading negotiations, recently securing an agreement whereby the U.S. Department of Education is going to start to discharge loans students of certain schools. That\u2019s the kind of advocacy that we are bringing to this. It\u2019s a top priority for our office.</span></p> <p><span><strong>FM: Another one of your top priorities was addressing prescription drug and heroin abuse. Why do you think that is such a prevalent problem in the United States?</strong></span></p> <p><span>MH: Well, I think a few things have contributed to it. I think that the rise of opioid prescriptions over the last 15 years has helped create what is now a public health epidemic. I think that drug cartels are out there and have figured out ways to not only get heroin in but also to manufacture new drugs like fentanyl that are coming into our communities that are incredibly potent and lethal. And I think that for far too long in this country we haven\u2019t paid enough attention to issues of substance use, mental health and behavioral health, and we need to better address those issues. If there\u2019s going to be a silver lining in this crisis, it's that we are going to have a real conversation in this country about substance use and about mental health, and recognizing that most all of us have one or another or both in our families. For far too long, people have not wanted to talk about it and kept it under the rug, and we got to bring it out into the open, so that people can get help. People need education. There can be better prevention efforts going on.... That\u2019s why we\u2019ve made it top of the agenda.</span></p> <p><span><strong>FM: I know transgender rights is a big priority for you. Why would someone oppose the transgender rights bill, and what would you say to them?</strong></span></p> <p><span>MH: I would say, don\u2019t we want to treat others the way we\u2019d want to be treated? I don\u2019t understand the opposition to this bill. To me, it\u2019s a simple matter. We respect one another. We respect one another\u2019s privacy. We shouldn\u2019t discriminate based on race, sexual orientation, gender, age, ability-disability, I could go on\u2014or gender identity. It\u2019s as simple as that. And I think unfortunately there is bias, there\u2019s prejudice, there\u2019s hate. And I think that forces that are opposed to LGBT equality have generally used this as an issue to essentially manufacture, mischaracterize, what this is about. And it\u2019s been to the detriment of transgender people here in the state.</span></p> <p><span><strong>FM: As the first openly gay Attorney General in the United States, did you ever believe sexual orientation would hinder your pursuit of public office?</strong></span></p> <p><span>MH: No, there are any number of things that could hinder me. You know, I say that sort of kiddingly, but when I ran it was interesting because my sexual orientation was not talked about in this race here in Massachusetts. I take that as a positive sign. That said, I think it\u2019s important that we support people running for office no matter their race, their ethnicity, their sexual orientation, their gender, their gender identity. This should be about who wants to serve and help people. So, I don\u2019t view it as a limitation. I recognize that there has been a lot of prejudice out there. Look at the current issue, we are dealing with around gender for example. If you look at Congress, less than 20 percent are women. My point is that you can look at any number of examples whether in government, whether in business, where there are just too many disparities, whether they are racial or gender or other. We want a society where everybody feels like they got an opportunity to compete, to be considered. They shouldn\u2019t be held back, based on anything but their imagination or their ability.</span></p> <p><span><br></span></p> <p><span><em>This interview has been edited for clarity, length, and style.</em><br></span></p>"}
{"title": "The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><em>The Honorable Michael Chertoff \u201975 served as the second Secretary of Homeland Security from 2005 to 2009 under President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama. After graduating magna cum laude from both Harvard College and Harvard Law School, Chertoff clerked in the Supreme Court from 1979 to 80 for outspoken progressive Justice William J. Brennan Jr. From 1980 to 2005, he served as a federal prosecutor, as Assistant U.S. Attorney General under President George W. Bush, and as Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. After leaving government service, he co-founded Chertoff Group, a security and risk management consulting firm. He lives in Washington, D.C. with his wife, Meryl J. Chertoff \u201979, and has two children.</em></span></p> <p><span><strong>Fifteen Minutes: Last month, you and dozens of Republican national security and foreign policy experts co-signed a letter that denounced the views and rhetoric of Mr. Trump, including his plan for the Mexican government to build a wall. As Secretary of Homeland Security under President Bush, you were a vocal advocate of the construction of roughly 700 miles of fencing along the border. Do you still believe that a wall is an effective form of immigration policy?</strong></span></p> <p><span>Michael Chertoff: We looked at the entire southern border. There are some areas where having a barrier gives the Border Patrol an opportunity to intercept people who might otherwise come across the border very quickly and then get onto a major highway and disappear into a cab.</span></p> <p><span>We worked with the Border Patrol and we figured it's about between 600 and 700 miles where a barrier would be useful in terms of\u2014not preventing, because we will never prevent it\u2014really slowing up people trying to get across.</span></p> <p><span>What is more important, and what we deployed, are radar, sensors, and we doubled the size of Border Patrol. Those are the kinds of things that are useful in terms of reducing the flow across the border. I think, obviously, there's more that could be done with respect to illegal immigration, including enforcing interior rules and deporting people who don't have legal authorization, but anybody who thinks just building a giant wall is going to do the trick is in dream land.</span></p> <p><span><strong>FM: In a 2005 Senate hearing, you said, \u201cOur goal at DHS is to completely eliminate the 'catch-and-release' enforcement problem and return every single illegal entrant, no exceptions.\u201d In 2008 you told the AP, \u201cIllegal migrants really degrade the environment. I've seen pictures of human waste, garbage, discarded bottles and other human artifact in pristine areas.\u201d Given the time that has passed since you made those comments, what are your current views on Federal policy with regards to the handling of undocumented immigrants?</strong></span></p> <p><span>MC: First of all, we did end \"catch-and-release.\" Under \"Catch-and-release,\u201d we had too slow a process for returning people who we caught crossing illegally, and we had too few facilities to hold them until they could be sent back, so they wound up being released. Over 80 percent never showed up for their hearings, they just disappeared. For some people who wanted to come to the U.S. illegally, it was easier to get in illegally than legally. All you have to do is cross the border and then when you're caught, you'll get released and you'll go hide. It's very bad to suggest to people that the route to immigration should be illegal rather than legal.</span></p> <p><span>What we did was streamline the process for sending people back. That meant in a matter of months, basically for anybody who was caught, the exception being humanitarian reasons. That was part of what enabled us to begin to depress the flow of people crossing the border illegally.</span></p> <p><span>What I said in 2008 is true. My point was, if you have a lot of illegal immigration traffic in a central area, you\u2019re not going to have a pristine environment. Because if you looked at the areas where you had a lot of crossings, you did see a lot of garbage, a lot of waste, animals were being killed. There was no environmental benefit in not having the infrastructure to be able to control the border.</span></p> <p><span>I think the right answer is what we said back in 2007, 2008. We should have an efficient system for legally admitting temporary workers who want to work in the country temporarily, who are filling employment needs. We should have an orderly process for people who want to become citizens, but it should be through the front door, and not over the fence.</span></p> <p><span><strong>FM: After the attacks in Brussels, Ted Cruz said, \"We need to empower law enforcement to patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalized.\u201d How do you believe the Federal Government should best prevent domestic and terror attacks?</strong></span></p> <p><span>MC: First of all, we don't really have in this country, unlike in Europe, many so-called, \"Muslim neighborhoods.\u201d In addition, the Muslim community in the U.S. involves people from a whole host of countries. Lumping all Muslims together is like lumping all Christians together, and that doesn't make any sense.</span></p> <p><span>First, we need to work with the Muslim community and community leaders to refute the extremist ideology, which the terrorists are using to try and recruit people into their cause. The community leaders need to make it clear this is bogus.</span></p> <p><span>Also, you obviously need to get information when someone is doing something that suggests they're planning a terrorist attack, whether it's getting on social media, or accumulating a large amount of material that is used in bomb making; certain kinds of chemicals.</span></p> <p><span>Finally, we have some intelligence capabilities, in terms of our ability to monitor whether people in this country are communicating with people in Syria, for example. There are a lot of intelligence tools that can be used, and a big part of it is having a good relationship with the communities in which the extremists are trying to recruit.</span></p> <p><span><strong>FM: In recent years, we've had Ebola, then the Zika virus, enter the U.S. and create serious health threats. Given your experience as Secretary of Homeland Security, how should the U.S. deal with highly lethal diseases coming in from abroad?</strong></span></p> <p><span>MC: You want an early warning, as quickly as possible. You can ideally deal with the problem from where it's being generated, rather than waiting for it to come to the U.S.</span></p> <p><span>Some people have said, \u201cOh, you should shut the borders.\u201d I will tell you, we once modeled an exercise to see\u2014if you shut the borders totally, stopped all air flights and anybody coming in, how much would that delay a pandemic? The answer is about one week. It's virtually impossible to prevent a pandemic. What you do do is seriously damage the economy and make it hard to respond by getting food and medicine in.</span></p> <p><span>What you do want to do is get medicine and treatment out as widely distributed as possible. Have certain protocols in place, to minimize the extent to which people are in proper places where they can pick up the disease. It's very challenging, but I will tell you the one thing that does not work, is trying to close the borders.</span></p> <p><span><strong>FM: Just six months into your role at Homeland Security, Hurricane Katrina struck and Homeland Security and FEMA especially faced intense criticism for the handling of the hurricane. What lessons did you learn from Hurricane Katrina as an early instance in your career at Homeland Security? How did you implement those lessons to create new disaster relief policy?</strong></span></p> <p><span>MC: The general doctrine, and the general structure of disaster management prior to Katrina, was based on the concept that local and state government would provide the response. The ideal was not that the federal government be the first responder. That almost always works well, because most states, particularly states in the hurricane zone, had a pretty well-developed system for dealing with hurricanes.</span></p> <p><span>With Katrina, the locality and the state were overwhelmed and essentially abdicated; they ceased to be able to carry out their functions. For example, the city had no plan for evacuating people. The buses sat in a parking lot until they got flooded. They had no idea how many people were sick or where they were located. It was very difficult to evacuate.</span></p> <p><span>The federal government, which had never been called upon to do this, was forced to improvise, and that was very challenging. After that experience of Katrina, we decided we were going to change the doctrine. We were going to prepare the federal government to be a first responder of last resort, which meant building a set of capabilities about evacuation and other things that we would use if the state or city somehow was not able to carry out its responsibility.</span></p> <p><span>Second, we realized we needed to build a joint plan with the state and local governments. If something happened, we all knew what our roles were, we knew where people were that had to be evacuated.</span></p> <p><span><strong>FM: Over the last 10 years especially, cyber security has come to the forefront of U.S. national security policy. Under your tenure, in what ways were you able to strengthen Homeland Security's ability to respond to cyber threats and cyber terrorism? In what ways do you believe that the department should continue to improve?</strong></span></p> <p><span>MC: During my tenure, we met regularly with Defense Department and the Intelligence Community and began to develop what was called the \u201cComprehensive National Cyber-Security Initiative,\u201d which was the first ever to pull together all the elements necessary to have a comprehensive cyber security approach.That means getting the resources and plans, so that the federal government can increase its ability to protect against cyber attacks.</span></p>"}

{"title": "For Faust, Free Speech Entails Accountability | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Andrew M. Duehren", "body": "<p><span>After a Harvard Law School student made a public comment many perceived as anti-Semitic, the school plunged into a debate about free speech on campus, and Law School Dean Martha L. Minow quickly denounced the statement as \u201coffensive.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Now, two weeks later, University President Drew G. Faust has affirmed that free speech does not mean the speaker should be protected from backlash.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cYou\u2019re free to say what you want,\u201d Faust said in an interview Wednesday. \u201cYou're also free to take the hits for saying things that are stupid or prejudicial or uninformed. Those two things go together.\u201d </span></p> <p><span>Controversy <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/4/22/law-students-criticize-controversial-comments/\">engulfed </a>the Law School last month when a student\u2014whose name was originally withheld, but is <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/4/27/controversial-comment-reignites-free-speech-debate/\">now identified</a> as third-year Law student Husam El-Qoulaq\u2014asked former Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni \u201cHow is it that you are so smelly?\u201d Many quickly decried the comment as anti-Semitic, and Minow called the comment \u201can embarrassment to our institution\u201d in an email to Law School students, faculty, and staff.</span></p> <p><span>The comment soon <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/4/27/controversial-comment-reignites-free-speech-debate/\">reinvigorated </a>a discussion on the degree to which speech deemed offensive should be protected, with some demanding that El-Qoulaq\u2019s name become public to hold him accountable for his remarks. The Law School removed footage of the event and declined to name El-Qoulaq, and the Harvard Law Record initially removed comments from its website identifying him\u2014though El-Qoulaq eventually decided to allow the Record to publish his name.</span></p> <p><span>Faust argued that free speech entails accountability.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWith freedom comes responsibility,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I believe when free speech results in utterances that are wrong or appalling, it\u2019s incumbent on the rest of the people in the community to point that out, correct the record, denounce the prejudice, whatever the needed intervention should be.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>El-Qoulaq has since apologized for his comments, which he said he did not intend to be anti-Semitic.

The implausible inanity that \u201cVeep\u201d is premised upon is all too plausible. It was unclear whether Donald Trump was the butt of his SNL appearance or we were.<br></span></p> <p><span>How can we exaggerate, and therefore satirize, an election cycle with a man who <a href=\"http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/news/a24057/donald-trump-presidential-run-2016-072913/\">thinks</a> \u201cit really doesn\u2019t matter what the media write as long as you\u2019ve got a young, and beautiful piece of ass\u201d?</span></p> <p><span>But political satire still is necessary\u2014if not to intoxicate us with improbable fantasy, then to sober us up to our unlikely reality.

There is solemn truth to a popular meme circulating the web this year: We used to laugh at comedians, and listen to politicians. Now we laugh at politicians and listen to comedians.</span></p> <p><span>This year, we listened to John Oliver, Amy Schumer, and Samantha Bee as they angrily implored Americans to wake up, delivering fiery torrent after torrent at the current state of our nation\u2019s politics.</span></p> <p><span>And last week, we saw this acerbic, mission-oriented brand of political humor on a different, more powerful stage\u2014the <a href=\"http://time.com/4313618/white-house-correspondents-dinner-2016-president-obama-jokes-transcript-full/\">2016 White House Correspondents Dinner</a>, an event for Washington\u2019s most high-minded to politely indulge the most powerful man in the free world as he delivers harmless one-liners and self-deprecating punchlines.</span></p> <p><span>But President Obama had a different plan in mind for his final dinner: to use absurd means to call attention to the absurdity of the world. Last week, we saw a president disenchanted with the descent of his nation and intelligent enough to use comedy as a tool to make this anger clear.</span></p> <p><span>A far cry from Reagan joking about his age at the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP6WCxBBrmo\">1988 dinner</a>, this year Obama didn\u2019t pull any punches, and these punches were not aimed at himself. An uppercut at corrupt media establishments:\"'Spotlight' is... a movie about investigative journalists with the resources and the autonomy to chase down the truth and hold the powerful accountable. Best fantasy film since 'Star Wars.'\u201d A hook at Republican congressmen: \"In just six short months, I will be officially a lame duck...and Republican leaders won\u2019t take my phone calls. And this is going to take some getting used to.\u201d And a fatal sucker punch at the whole situation: \"Eight years ago, I said it was time to change the tone of our politics.

It will be harder to convince the American people that Hillary was born in Kenya,\u201d he said at last year\u2019s dinner. But never before have they had such a sense of urgency. Obama seems to be doing what Trevor Noah or John Oliver do every week\u2014making us laugh, yes, but to the end that we realize that this humor masks a painfully unfunny reality. Like any good comedian, Obama ended his roast with a mic drop\u2014a universally recognized symbol of odium and disappointment, and a sign that he is self-aware that this was no ordinary Washington black tie affair.</span></p> <p><span>Somewhere between the obligatory self-loathing and lovable dad jokes is a morbid sense of humor in our president\u2014the type of humor that dominated this election cycle and will likely continue to gain traction as long as we as a nation maintain this level of political dysfunction. \u201cThe end of the republic never looked better,\u201d Obama joked at the beginning of his roast, a line that cued rapturous applause and laughter in the audience. The real punchline, though, was that he was not kidding.</span></p> <p><span><br></span></p> <p><span><em>Shubhankar Chhokra \u201918, a Crimson editorial writer, is a social studies concentrator in Eliot House.

Invoking the \u201cwe\u201d has proved the best way to pitch The Crimson\u2019s editorial board to small-fish freshmen looking to make something of themselves: \u201cWe\u2019re the voice of the paper,\u201d a younger member of the board says to the potential recruit.

{"title": " Law Students Clash Over Posters and Free Speech  | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Claire E. Parker", "body": "<p><span>Tensions flared in a standoff between activists and opposing students at Harvard Law School Friday as an intensifying debate that began over posters evolved into one about rights to space and free speech on campus.</span></p> <p><span>The controversy began Monday, when third-year Law student William H. Barlow\u2014a vocal critic of the Reclaim Harvard Law student group\u2014put posters on the walls of the Caspersen Student Center lounge equating the activist movement to Republican presidential candidate Donald J. Trump. Activists removed the posters\u2014an action Barlow considered a violation of his right to free speech.</span></p> <p><span>Barlow said he originally intended for the posters to publicize his concerns that Reclaim Harvard Law has had a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on speech at the Law School. Activists have been <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/2/17/activists-occupy-wasserstein/\">occupying the lounge</a>, which they call \u201cBelinda Hall,\u201d since February as part of their efforts to create a space they say does not exist for minority students at the school. Barlow has spoken out publicly against the occupation and activists\u2019 <a href=\"https://reclaimharvardlaw.wordpress.com/\">demands</a>, which include changing the school\u2019s now-defunct <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/3/4/law-school-seal-report/\">seal </a>and creating a critical race theory program, an idea he has called \u201cracist.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Barlow claimed Both Trump and Reclaim \u201csupport the suppression of dissent, and, to a certain extent, both of them support or endorse racist ideologies.\u201d Barlow put up posters that read \u201cReclaim Harvard Law = Trump.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Reclaim Harvard Law member Rena T. Karefa-Johnson said activists decided to remove the posters they considered to be offensive, in part because the Muslim Law Students Association held a conference in the lounge the day Barlow put up signs referencing Trump.</span></p> <p><span>After activists took the posters down, Barlow appealed to administrators and began a week-long postering campaign in protest, affixing to the walls signs that accused Reclaim Harvard Law of censorship. Barlow maintained that the lounge is a public space where any student is allowed to speak freely. Activists, however, claim that while they have repeatedly invited dissenting students to speak with them, occupying the lounge gives them control of the space.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis is an occupation. This is our space, our house,\u201d Reclaim Harvard Law member Alexander J. Clayborne said. \u201cLet Bill Barlow put up posters anywhere else, just not here.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The dispute came to a head Friday, when dozens of Law School affiliates filled the student lounge as Barlow and several supporters returned at 2 p.m. to put up another round of signs. Confrontations between activists and dissenting students quickly turned hostile, as students sharply debated both the poster issue and their right to film their opponents in the lounge. Activists did not discard any of Barlow\u2019s signs, but instead moved them to a wall under a sign of their own creation that read \u201cPrivilege.\u201d Dean of Students Marcia L. Sells watched the the events unfold and fielded questions from both sides.</span></p> <p><span>Administrators face criticisms from both camps. Barlow met with Sells to voice his concerns earlier in the week, alleging that activists who removed his posters had violated the school\u2019s \u201cProtest and Dissent Guidelines.\u201d  Activists, meanwhile, took issue with administrators\u2019 rhetoric and speed of response.</span></p> <p><span>Sells <a href=\"http://hlrecord.org/2016/03/reclaim-harvard-law-removes-critical-posters-stirring-debate-over-academic-freedom/\">issued a statement</a> to the Harvard Law Record, writing \u201cThe University\u2019s and Law School\u2019s commitment to freedom of speech and academic freedom, however, requires that those who use shared space for expressive purposes must respect the rights of others to do the same, including those who disagree with them. These values of free exchange are essential to an academic community.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Late Friday morning, Law School Dean Martha L. Minow reiterated this message in an email to Law School affiliates, stating explicitly that the lounge was a communal space available to all students, and removing posters is a violation of the school\u2019s <a href=\"http://hls.harvard.edu/dept/dos/student-orgs/handbook-for-officers/protest-and-dissent-guidelines/\">Protest and Dissent Guidelines</a>. She wrote that administrators are working to create a designated space for students to post their opinions and provide guidelines to ensure that the space is inclusive. Additionally, the school will \u201ctake steps to ensure that students and student organizations have ample opportunities to use space to engage in study, discussion, teach-ins, and other forms of collective speech and action.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Minow\u2019s reference to a Law School policy prohibiting \u201c[u]sing or threatening force or violence\u201d struck a chord with activists, who interpreted the line as an implication that Reclaim Harvard Law members could turn violent.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI have been deeply disgusted with the way it has felt like a dog whistle. When have we ever been violent?\u201d Titilayo S. Rasaki, a second-year Law student and member of Reclaim Harvard Law, said.</span></p> <p><span>Barlow, meanwhile, expressed disappointment that administrators have thus far refrained from taking disciplinary action against students who took down his posters earlier in the week and allowed members of Reclaim Harvard Law to relocate his signs on Friday.</span></p> <p><span>The controversy comes at the start of the school\u2019s admitted students weekend, and some prospective students observing the debate unfold in the lounge Friday said that protests at the school will factor into their decision to attend.</span></p> <p><span>Admitted student Paul Maneri said he has been following ongoing activism at the Law School in order to determine how racial tensions could affect his experience there.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to figure out if these issues are specific to Harvard\u2014if Harvard is doing things better or worse than other schools\u2013since it seems like [race] has been more of a conversation here,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s because things are worse here, or if people just care more.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Claire E.

Shortly before Housing Day, the video\u2014which had previously been approved by the House\u2019s Faculty Deans and tutors\u2014was taken down.</span></p> <p><span>One does not need to be a fan of Donald Trump to recognize that he is no longer a fringe character. While Trump\u2019s meteoric political rise is disturbing, it also makes him a valid target for satire. In light of this reality, Currier House\u2019s recent decision to <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/3/10/currier-removes-trump-video/\">take down</a> a Housing Day video featuring the businessman and Republican presidential front-runner was wrong.</span></p> <p><span>With the exception of passing references to campus liberalism and Ted Cruz, the video is entirely apolitical. It does not purport to promote, endorse, or sanction Donald Trump, his policies, or his rhetoric. Even had the video been more politically charged, it still would not be Currier\u2019s place to decide what topics are valid objects of political satire. Such a view would find us on an uncomfortable and slippery slope down the dark road of administrative censorship.</span></p> <p><span>After all, this video was created by Currier\u2019s House Committee, the body that supposedly represents the residents of the House. If the video needed to be taken down, it should only have been done after extensive dialogue with students. Though productive dialogue did occur at a town hall meeting after the video was taken down, the House should have conducted a longer and more thorough process of consultation before reaching a final decision.</span></p> <p><span>Some Currier residents, especially Latino, undocumented, and Muslim students, may very well have  felt uncomfortable with satirizing Trump, given his bigoted and racist views. But opposition to his poisonous rhetoric is precisely why it deserves satire. Indeed, all political satire inevitably touches on difficult topics.</span></p> <p><span>Other apolitical Housing Day videos could be similarly construed as offensive. Numerous videos describe gratuitous sex, drinking, or drug consumption or, more appropriately, they parody songs that do. By the standards of Currier House, these videos should be taken down as well.</span></p> <p><span>The brutal reality is that Donald Trump is leading the race for the Republican nomination. As of now, he has amassed nearly <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/republican_delegate_count.html\">50 percent</a> of all GOP delegates awarded thus far. He is the subject of constant political discussion, newspaper headlines, and cable news coverage. He is certainly a reasonable target for satire.</span></p> <p><span>More fundamentally, Housing Day videos are not house mascots. They are not comparable to shields, crests, or namesakes. They do not represent a House, nor do they embody it. They are one-time, passing, light-hearted, student-created, and unofficial ways to celebrate Housing Day. When they satirize the Republican presidential frontrunner\u2014hardly a road less traveled\u2014let\u2019s not blow it out of proportion. Let\u2019s not censor it either.</span></p>"}
{"title": "What\u2019s the Plan for the Revolution? | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>\u201cYou say you want a revolution / Well, you know / We all want to change the world\u201d - \u201cRevolution,\u201d The Beatles</span></p> <p><span>Over the past few months, Bernie Sanders has roused millions of Americans with his call for a \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d and his <a href=\"https://berniesanders.com/issues/\">promises</a> of Medicare for all, free college tuition, and a $15 minimum wage. When asked what obstacles stand in the way of this revolutionary change, Sanders <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/berniesanders/posts/887965887925083:0\">tends to talk about</a> the \u201cdisastrous Supreme Court decision in the Citizens United case,\u201d referring to the 2010 Supreme Court case that allowed individuals and corporations to spend virtually unlimited amounts of money on elections. Both Sanders and his Democratic primary opponent, Hillary Clinton, have pledged that, if elected, they would consider opposition to Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission to be a litmus test for any Supreme Court nominee.</span></p> <p><span>But the problems with American democracy run much deeper than Citizens United, and they will persist even if the decision is reversed. Because of <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/5/8/5695350/this-is-what-america-would-look-like-without-gerrymandering\">totally nonsensical rules</a> that give politicians in state legislatures the power to draw the lines between congressional districts, the Republican majority in the House of Representatives is virtually guaranteed until after the next census in 2020.</span></p> <p><span>Every ten years, per a <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/history/pdf/Article_1_Section_2.pdf\">constitutional requirement</a>, the federal government conducts a census and recalculates how many congressional seats are allocated to each state. Each state then has its own process for redrawing the lines of its districts. The only fixed rule is that each district should have a roughly equal population. The problem is that most states grant the power to redraw the lines to their state legislatures, rather than non-partisan commissions. And there are <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/05/15/americas-most-gerrymandered-congressional-districts/\">lots of ways to draw these lines</a>, some more advantageous than others.</span></p> <p><span>Here\u2019s the point: If your party sweeps a bunch of governorships and majorities of state legislatures in a year that ends with a zero, you get to redraw the districts in those states. This essentially guarantees your side ten years of favorable lines. The basic strategy is to pack voters who lean toward the opposite party into just a few districts, where the other side will win with overwhelming majorities. This leaves your party with smaller but still comfortable majorities in many other districts.</span></p> <p><span>That\u2019s precisely what happened after 2010. That year, the Republicans seized control of <a href=\"http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/political_commentary/commentary_by_tim_storey/gop_makes_historic_state_legislative_gains_in_2010\">20 state legislatures</a>, their best performance in the states since <a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/press-room/republicans-exceed-expectations-in-2010.aspx\">1952</a>. The results were stunning. Two years later, in 2012, Barack Obama won 48.4 percent of the <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/2012-election/results/president/north-carolina/\">statewide vote</a> in North Carolina, widely regarded as a swing state. But thanks to lines drawn by a wave of Tea Party state legislators elected in 2010, North Carolinians <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/2012-election/results/house/north-carolina/\">elected</a> nine Republicans and only four Democrats to represent them in the House. (The state Democracy Party is still <a href=\"http://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article59299868.html\">contesting</a> these lines in court, but the odds are not in their favor.)</span></p> <p><span>On a national scale, skewed totals in each state add up to tilt the entire playing field. In 2012, President Obama won re-election by a margin of 5 million votes; nationwide, Democratic candidates for the House <a href=\"http://history.house.gov/Institution/Election-Statistics/Election-Statistics/\">won over a million votes more</a> than their Republican counterparts. But when the dust had settled, the Republicans maintained a 33-seat advantage in the chamber.</span></p> <p><span>Unless 2016 is different because the Republican Party implodes at the convention over Trump, it is <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/gerrymandering-made-impossible-democrats-win-house\">extremely unlikely</a> that the Democrats will take back the House in 2016. The <a href=\"http://www.pivit.io/politics\">prediction markets</a> know this: That\u2019s why they give Hillary Clinton a 71 percent of being the next president, but the Democrats only a 7 percent chance of retaking the House. The Democrats will face even steeper odds in 2018, because Republicans tend to <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-house-republicans-did-even-better-than-they-expected/\">benefit from lower turnout</a> and have historically done better in midterm elections.</span></p> <p><span>In the long term, the best answer for our democracy is to mandate that states make their redistricting processes bipartisan. But for now, seeing as there is no clear path to end the practice before 2020, Democrats have to immediately start preparing a strategy to retake governorships and state legislatures before the next census. They have to start redirecting more party resources away from the presidential campaign, down toward state-level races where a little money makes a big difference. They have to start playing the game.</span></p> <p><span>John Lennon, who knew something about imagining a better world, once <a href=\"http://genius.com/The-beatles-revolution-lyrics\">sang</a>: \u201cYou say you got a real solution / Well, you know / We'd all love to see the plan.\u201d Here\u2019s a plan for all my fellow progressives, especially those who lust after the Sanders platform: The next four years will be a slog, even in the best-case scenario.

If Hillary Clinton gets the nomination, she will inherit a liberal base that increasingly believes in the Sanders vision.</span></p> <p><span>If only the revolution can stay alive till 2020, it stands a real chance of enactment.</span></p> <p><span><em><br></em></span></p> <p><span><em>Eyck A.

At the time, no respondents indicated support for businessman Donald J. Trump, though former Republican Club President Aaron I. Henricks \u201916 joked in February a Harvard Trump supporter may reside in \u201cthe far reaches of the Quad.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Rubio\u2019s decision last Tuesday to end his bid for presidency represents the loss of the favored candidate by the Harvard Republicans and leaves the undergraduates with an unclear preferred candidate.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cFor a lot of Harvard Republicans and a lot of Republicans around the country I think we lost our first and second choices in some order or another when Rubio dropped out after Bush,\u201d Henricks said. \u201cI think everyone is pretty dejected and pretty disappointed with how the race has gone and the way that the frontrunner has conducted himself.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Cameron K. Khansarinia \u201918, who worked as National Co-Chair of Students for Rubio during the senator\u2019s campaign, expressed an overriding sense of disappointment in how the election has proceeded, blaming the media as well as voters.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cTo see a positive, issues-oriented campaign like Marco\u2019s have to leave the race because there was no room for him in this election cycle was incredibly disappointing,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed in the voters for not being able to look past anger and at solutions. Most of all I\u2019m disappointed in the media for perpetuating the Donald Trump fiasco.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Now, with the Republican Club\u2019s three preferred candidates out of the race, Republicans on campus are considering whether they will divert their support to Governor John Kasich, Senator Ted Cruz, or hope for an open national convention if Trump fails to secure the required 1, 237 delegates, Gwen R. Thomas \u201917, current President of the Harvard Republican Club, said.</span></p> <p><span>Campaigning is currently at a standstill as Thomas said club Republicans are \u201clukewarm\u201d in their support for Cruz and still weighing options.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf he\u2019s the nominee, I think some of us will campaign for him. Right now I don\u2019t think anyone is doing anything,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had people working for Rubio and Bush up to this point but none of us are campaigning right now. I guess the feeling is we\u2019re watching to see what happens.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Thomas said many Harvard Republicans expressed apprehension over the success Trump has had in the race, and the implications his campaign has had for their party.

{"title": "\u200bIn Defense of Sensitivity | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>These past few weeks, I have been shocked and saddened by the backlash to Currier\u2019s removal of its Housing Day video.  Why has it become controversial to support members of our own community?<br></span></p> <p><span>In Currier\u2019s video, a student dressed as Donald Trump is looking to buy property at Harvard and ultimately decides that Currier is his favorite place on campus.  Shortly after it was posted, the video was removed in response to some Currier students\u2019 concerns that it makes light of a candidate whose rhetoric deeply disturbs and frightens them.</span></p> <p><span>What worries me even more than the video itself is the response that I have seen to its removal.  Within hours of its being taken off of YouTube, some students had reposted the video to another site and were sharing it alongside messages about how Harvard \u201ccoddles\u201d its students and should instead be encouraging them to grow thicker skin.  Even when students were moved to tears at a town hall meeting that evening as they discussed the ways that Trump\u2019s rhetoric personally threatens them, some continued to argue that the video should be posted.  Just yesterday, a Crimson <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/3/23/trump-and-satire/\">editorial</a> defended the video on the grounds that it is \u201clight-hearted\u201d satire that should not be blown \"out of proportion.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In my view, this response reveals a grave lack of compassion in our community.  When we hear that something we have done has hurt other people and choose not to respond, we belittle their pain.  When we claim that the video was all in jest, that it was anti-Trump anyway so they should toughen up and not worry about it, we act as though their emotions and life experiences are invalid.  Somehow we think we know how they should feel, when in reality we have no idea what it is like to be in their shoes.  For many of us who are not members of communities that Trump has targeted with hateful rhetoric, we cannot know what it feels like to fear violent expressions of Islamophobia or other repercussions of his campaign.  Who are we to say that a Housing Day video satirizing him is not hurtful enough to warrant being taken down?</span></p> <p><span>Ironically, by writing off the concerns of their peers, some students are acting in accordance with the beliefs of the very man they claim the video criticizes.  At the heart of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign is his <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/live/republican-debate-election-2016-cleveland/trump-on-political-correctness/\">rejection</a> of \u201cpolitical correctness.\u201d  He distinguishes himself from other politicians through his willingness to make divisive and offensive comments, often targeting specific population groups such as Muslims or Mexican immigrants.  According to Trump, the prospect of hurting someone else should not stop us from saying or doing what we want.  When Harvard students argue that Currier administrators should have left the video online despite the pain that it caused others, they are essentially adopting Trump\u2019s logic.  As long as I find the video hilarious or satirical or harmless, they seem to say, I should feel free to share it.</span></p> <p><span>What this reasoning fails to take into account is the fact that when some members of our community are hurting, the whole body suffers.  In our first days at Harvard, we are repeatedly told that one of the most valuable parts of being here is the people.  We are surrounded by a sea of brilliant and unique peers who can teach us more than we could ever learn inside a classroom.  The residential houses at Harvard are meant to foster these relationships, and the purpose of Housing Day is to welcome freshmen into the house communities.  If we release a divisive Housing Day video that alienates a segment of our community and makes some incoming freshmen uncomfortable, we are acting in opposition to the core purpose of Housing Day.  If we refuse to listen to one another\u2019s concerns and do not make an effort to build cohesive community, we are wasting one of the most precious gifts that Harvard offers us.</span></p> <p><span>Taking other people\u2019s feelings seriously and acting accordingly is not always \u201ccoddling\u201d them.  Rather, it is a way of supporting them as they walk through all of the hate and messiness that life throws their way.  We are fortunate to live with an incredibly diverse group of peers, but if we don\u2019t work to ensure that everyone feels like a valued member of this community, we are wasting an opportunity we\u2019ve been given.</span></p> <p><span><br></span></p> <p><span><em>Michaela B.

{"title": "The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>\u201cThis is not my favorite tour,\u201d Thomas M. Lauderdale \u201992 says, exhaling a lungful of smoke and bringing his cigarette to his mouth for another drag.</span></p> <p><span>Pink Martini has been on the road for about a week, though Lauderdale says it feels like a month. His mood is a little surprising. Lauderdale\u2019s name has been synonymous with eccentric energy for practically his whole life. A Crimson profile written by Michael R. Grunwald \u201992 in Lauderdale\u2019s senior year describes him \u201cworking the mid-afternoon crowd\u201d on Mt. Auburn Street \u201clike a town mayor on acid.\u201d  Today, though, the mayor looks beat.</span></p> <p><span>Lauderdale\u2019s band, Pink Martini, defies succinct definition. Lauderdale describes its genre with characteristically high amounts of whimsy and frustratingly low amounts of actual information. It\u2019s like \u201c\u2018Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s\u2019 meets the United Nations from 1962,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>The band\u2019s lead singer, China Forbes \u201992, also gives it a shot (\u201cold-fashioned pop,\u201d or maybe \u201csky\u2019s-the-limit orchestral pop\u201d) but ultimately gives up. \u201cThere really is no way to describe it in a few words.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>A quick glance at Pink Martini\u2019s discography tells you why the self-styled \u201clittle orchestra\u201d is so hard to pin down. Their 2007 album, \u201cHey Eugene!,\u201d for instance, features songs in French, Portuguese, Spanish, Japanese, Russian, Arabic, and English. The titular track is a song about an intoxicated nightclub encounter with a man named Eugene who doesn\u2019t call the singer afterwards.</span></p> <p><span>Whatever you want to call them, though, Pink Martini has staying power.  The duo met as undergrads in Adams House, when Lauderdale used to provide piano accompaniment for Forbes as she sang late-night Puccini and Verdi in the Adams Lower Common Room. A few years after their graduation, Lauderdale invited Forbes to start singing with his new group, Pink Martini. Nine albums and more than two decades later, they\u2019re still performing together.</span></p> <p><span>Forbes was a powerhouse in the arts community, winning the Jonathan Levy award her senior year and once convincing an undecided prefrosh to choose Harvard over Yale through the sheer allure of her voice. (\u201cI had such a huge crush on her that I wanted to come,\u201d said the prefrosh in question, Alexis Toomer \u201993, the year she graduated.)</span></p> <p><span>Lauderdale was a party boy. As Adams House\u2019s HoCo co-chair, he threw his fair share of \u201cmad dance parties,\u201d and says he almost got expelled for hosting a \u201cTruth or Dare\u201d party (held in honor of Madonna\u2019s album of the same name) in which he served alcohol to minors in the Adams Upper Common Room. He is also allegedly responsible for the closing of the Adams House Pool (now the Pool House Theater) after his raucous  party, \u201cBungle in the Jungle,\u201d became a clothing-optional bathhouse bacchanale. Forbes, though an Adams House resident, never actually went to the pool, saying she \u201cjust wasn\u2019t into orgies.\u201d In his profile, Grunwald called Lauderdale \u201cthe official cruise director for the class of \u201992.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Forbes sings a vocal warm-up that seems to consist of repeating the word \u201cOhio\u201d with varying amounts of volume and vibrato. Then, there\u2019s some tense confusion between Forbes and the crew over the levels of someone\u2019s microphone that went way over my head. Finally, she makes her way down to my photographer Rebecca and me.</span></p> <p><span>Charming and eloquent, Forbes approaches the interview with the polish of someone who\u2019s done this before. She tells me the secret to singing in so many languages (\u201c[I] pretend I\u2019m a little bit tipsy and then I just blur everything together\u201d), the feel of Portland in the mid-\u201990s when she joined Pink Martini (\u201csummer camp,\u201d) and some of her musical inspirations (Ella Fitzgerald, Carole King, Joni Mitchell, etc.). She compares Pink Martini\u2019s evolving sound to a recipe: \u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of cookie we\u2019re baking, but it\u2019s got way too many ingredients.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Lauderdale, by contrast, seems to have completely forgotten what an interview is. Clearly exhausted, he answers a question about his life post-Harvard with a meandering discussion of Andy Warhol\u2019s magazine \u201cInterview,\u201d and how writing changes when you use a computer rather than a pad of paper, like the one he used for his senior thesis.</span></p> <p><span>He quickly puts out his cigarette as we walk into the lobby of the Boston Sheraton. These days, Lauderdale says, he\u2019s particularly worried by the negativity and movement away from honest communication brought on by technology and reality television. On a TV behind him, CNN is running a segment on GOP opposition to Trump\u2019s presidential bid.  At various points, he asks me and Rebecca how we conduct our arguments and what our assessment of our generation is.</span></p> <p><span>It\u2019s not too surprising that politics is on his mind. He worked in city hall throughout high school and college, and  his goal on graduation was to become the Mayor of Portland\u2014though the closest he\u2019s come so far is a 1986 stint as Junior Mayor. He\u2019s stayed active in progressive politics and was invited by Congressman Earl Blumenauer to the State of the Union Address in 2013, where he was seated next to conservative rockstar Ted Nugent. There are also politics within the band, according to Lauderdale. Recently, Lauderdale hired an independent mediator to meet with every musician and staff member of Pink Martini in an attempt to address any concerns people don\u2019t want to bring up with him.</span></p> <p><span>After learning that Rebecca is a fan, Lauderdale perks up a bit, drawing her into a selfie that he insists they retake (\u201cI look like hell\u201d), getting us backstage passes so that she can photograph him and Forbes before the show, and even suggesting she sit next to him at the piano to take pictures. Finally, he asks us what time the show is, looks at his watch, and excuses himself to get dressed.</span></p> <p><span>Getting the photo of Forbes and Lauderdale together before the show starts proves stressful. Forbes seems to be in the midst of pre-show preparations when Lauderdale brings her out, and it\u2019s only when you see them standing next to each other that you realize what an odd couple they are. Forbes, tall, elegant, strikingly beautiful; and Lauderdale, short, platinum-haired and somewhat impish. Lauderdale wants one of them walking up the stairs to the stage. Forbes seems to want the whole business done with as quickly as possible.</span></p> <p><span> <br></span></p> <p><span>Rebecca and I make our way out the stage door and to the front to find our seats, nosebleeds a mile away from the stage. Even from that far back, though, the effect is magical. During the opening number, Lauderdale\u2019s hands grasshopper jauntily across the piano and Forbes\u2019s voice is pure velvet as she moves her shoulders in a way that is both classic and utterly beguiling. The magic isn\u2019t that they\u2019re good. Pick any Pink Martini review you can find, and chances are it\u2019s gushingly positive. The magic is the transformation. In front of a crowd, the angst and grind of the tour and soundcheck are replaced with a smooth, crowd-pleasing performance. It\u2019s alchemy, turning lead into gold.</span></p> <p><span>Lauderdale\u2019s patter is near-flawless, describing one song as \u201cI Will Survive\u201d meets \u201cHit the Road Jack\u201d meets Franz Schubert, all in 1950s Havana.  At the end of the night, the crowd calls the band back for an encore and dances in the aisles as they strike up again.</span></p> <p><span>After assuring the audience that the love is mutual, Pink Martini exits backstage. Four hours later, at 2a.m., they\u2019ll meet in front of the hotel, board the bus, and head to the next tour stop.</span></p>"}

His twin brother, Juli\u00e1n Castro, currently serves as President Barack H.

Both brothers are active supporters of Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.</span></p> <p><span>Joaqu\u00edn Castro, advocating Democratic policy, emphasized the need for immigration reform, and criticized the Republican presidential candidates for their handling of the issue throughout the current campaign cycle.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cDonald Trump and the Republicans have turned the conversation about immigration into a nasty one, and one that makes it hard for the country to come together,\u201d he said in an interview before his talk.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI feel like [Trump] kicked off his campaign with slander.

{"title": "Media and the Man | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>It sometimes seems that people only ascribe influence to mainstream media whenever they wish to admonish it. So it goes nowadays, where a modish new theory blaming the media for Donald Trump\u2019s improbable and inexorable rise has started to hold sway.<br></span></p> <p><span>On Monday, President Obama <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/03/obama-media-trump-toner-221319\">delivered</a> a gentle chiding to a gathered crowd of political journalists, who, in his words, have been missing substance in order to \u201cfill the void and feed the beast with instant commentary and Twitter rumors.\u201d Just the day before, Nicholas Kristof <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/27/opinion/sunday/my-shared-shame-the-media-helped-make-trump.html\">offered</a> his self-flagellation blaming the usual suspects: initial dismissal of The Donald as a living laugh line, followed by lavish airtime and little fact checking.</span></p> <p><span>To be sure, there are some claims that I am sympathetic to: Granting Trump an unprecedented number of phone interviews, <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/fe35c577e08847998e5ab9781596f9fb/wrong-number-trumps-tv-telephone-interviews-spotlight\">29</a> on the flagship Sunday talk shows since his campaign began, was, almost certainly, shameful deference to the campaign\u2019s requests prompted by tantalizing ratings boosts. And we could all do better with more aggressive interviews and fact-checks.</span></p> <p><span>But the albatross ought not to be hung around the media\u2019s neck just yet. First, exit polls show that Trump has triumphed due to significant support from disaffected, lower-income, and less-educated whites\u2014a crowd that I\u2019d speculate isn\u2019t terribly influenced by Politico, the New York Times\u2019s editorial page, and even CNN. Instead, critics are mistaking the chicken for the egg. Media coverage of Trump did not manufacture his meteoric rise in the polls so much as his enduring populism forced media to cover him.</span></p> <p><span>Second, even if one assumed that mass media do have an effect on Republican primary voters, it seems dubious to claim that Trump\u2019s \u201cearned media advantage\u201d was actually so advantageous. A favorite analysis of the blame-the-media brigade calculates that Trump has earned <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/upshot/measuring-donald-trumps-mammoth-advantage-in-free-media.html?_r=0\">$1.9 billion</a> in \u201cfree media.\u201d Though this number seems highly inflated (remember that the Obama and Romney campaigns drew <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/pres12/\">$2 billion</a> total in the last election), it also ignores the crucial distinction between positive and negative mentions.</span></p> <p><span>From the dawn of his campaign, many of Trump\u2019s miscues have been covered by mainstream press in excruciating detail, but never flatteringly: his <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/trump-attacks-mccain-i-like-people-who-werent-captured-120317\">mocking</a> of John McCain, condoning <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/03/11/donald-trumps-baffling-explanation-for-violence-at-his-campaign-rallies/\">violence</a> at campaign rallies, participating in an extremity-measuring <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/03/politics/donald-trump-small-hands-marco-rubio/\">contest</a> with Marco Rubio, having his campaign manager <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/30/us/politics/trump-campaign-manager-corey-lewandowski.html\">charged</a> for allegedly assaulting a Breitbart reporter, endorsing <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/08/donald-trumps-answer-on-torture-is-really-out-there-even-for-trump/\">torture</a>, among many, many others. The media isn\u2019t the problem here\u2014primary voters simply don\u2019t care about Trump\u2019s antics, no matter how unconventional and crude.</span></p> <p><span>Here again, I worry that hasty critics note the sharp upticks in support and media coverage, and conclude causality without much of a second thought. By the same token, Bernie Sanders\u2019 success must be due to media mentions, even though his title may as well be socialist rather than senator.</span></p> <p><span>Candid and unprompted admissions of error are, of course, a sorely-missed feature among the punditocracy, where outlandish predictions without risk of future reckoning have become something of a lucrative profession. But one shouldn\u2019t carry the cross too quickly\u2014and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/27/opinion/sunday/my-shared-shame-the-media-helped-make-trump.html\">denounce</a> one's companions as \u201clap dogs, not watchdogs\u201d with too much haste\u2014without due consideration.</span></p> <p><span>Put simply, the reason people are voting for Donald Trump is that people want to vote for Donald Trump. Few may want to believe this, but the alternate explanation\u2014that the mainstream media somehow subconsciously hoodwinked voters\u2014doesn\u2019t seem correct. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/25/upshot/measuring-donald-trumps-supporters-for-intolerance.html\">According</a> to polling, Trump supporters are disproportionately likely to support banning Muslims (and gays and lesbians) from entering the country, call for immediate deportation of undocumented immigrants, and even wish that the South had won the Civil War. They didn\u2019t learn these things from the Washington Post.</span></p> <p><span>For those who insist on a narrative, here\u2019s one: Trump\u2019s rise is the natural extension of years of dog-whistle politics embraced by Republican elites during the Obama years. Mitch McConnell, John Boehner, and Mitt Romney were all happy to flirt with the racists and nativists, the xeno- and Islamophobes for years. But only Donald had the gumption to finally ask them to prom.</span></p> <p><span><br></span></p> <p><span><em>Idrees M.

{"title": "A Little Yellow House: The IOP Turns 50 | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>A little house, painted yellow, with a small front stoop and an attic overlooking the road stood across from what was then the Holyoke Center, now the Smith Campus Center. It was this little yellow house where Harvard's Institute of Politics was born.</span></p> <p><span>The house went unnoticed on the IOP\u2019s opening night, October 17, 1966. The attention of the press, the students, and the secret service was directed across the street, where Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Robert F. Kennedy \u201948, Edward M. Kennedy \u201954, Institute President Richard E. Neustadt, Washington Post President Katharine Graham, and a number of others\u2014including cabinet members, an ambassador, and Harvard President Nathan M. Pusey \u201928\u2014gathered for the opening reception in the Holyoke Center penthouse.</span></p> <p><span>The Crimson reported at the time that about \u201c200 students and Harvard Square workers\u201d gathered outside the Holyoke Center, where the FBI mandated that the guards ask for identification from anybody entering the building. The Kennedy brothers were rushed to the Center after a political rally, stopping briefly to shake hands on their way inside, where a dinner of \u201coysters Rockefeller, endive ala Franchaise, and roast tenderloin of beef Bordelaise\u201d awaited them.</span></p> <p><span>The black-tie party in the Holyoke Center, said President Pusey, was not only \u201ca birthday party for the Kennedy Institute,\u201d but also a \u201cwedding feast\u201d between government and academia: \u201ca commemorative dinner\u201d for President Kennedy and the new Institute of Politics.</span></p> <p><span>The pageantry and fanfare of the dinner stands in contrast to \u201cthe little yellow house,\u201d as it was then known, which is flanked\u2014overshadowed\u2014on one side by the Spee, and on the other side by the Signet. The house at 78 Mount Auburn St. is where Harvard\u2019s \u201cliving memorial\u201d to President John F. Kennedy \u201940 began, and it still stands today, although the Institute moved to its present location on JFK Street in 1978.</span></p> <p><span>The fellows and students would meet in \u201ca small room,\u201d according to Mark D. Gearan \u201978, a former Crimson editor and member of the IOP\u2019s Student Advisory Committee, the undergraduate body partially responsible for the composition and direction of the Institute. \u201cLiterally, it was the living room,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>The small stature of the building did not reflect the power nor the importance of the guests that came and continue to come to the Institute to engage with Harvard undergraduates. For the next 50 years, the Institute has brought in speakers from all areas of public service.</span></p> <p><span>The Institute also has seen countless study groups and fellows, and the creation of the Director\u2019s Internships, the Policy Program, and the Harvard Political Review.</span></p> <p><span>All of this was done to fulfill the Institute\u2019s mission of engaging Harvard undergraduates with leaders in public service and encouraging these students to go into public service themselves, however the students may define it. On April 1 and 2, the Institute will celebrate its 50th anniversary of fulfilling this mission.</span></p> <p><span><strong>FORUM FOR POLITICAL LEADERS</strong></span></p> <p><span>One of the defining characteristics of the IOP is its ability to bring in prominent political figures. Congresswoman Elise M. Stefanik \u201906, who served as vice president of the Student Advisory Committee as an undergraduate, remembers the speakers as being a particularly noteworthy part of her Harvard experience.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe opportunities that the IOP provides are world class, and unlike any other institution in the world, really.\u201d Stefanik said. \u201cThe fact that they host speakers in the forum multiple times a week\u2026[is] unlike anywhere else, and it prepares you to have a seat at the table.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>From its very first days, the Institute has brought in high-profile and often controversial speakers. Robert S. McNamara, who served as the United States Secretary of Defense from 1961 to 1968 and was influential in defining America\u2019s role in Vietnam, was one of the first speakers at the IOP.</span></p> <p><span>McNamara\u2019s visit to campus didn\u2019t sit well with a large segment of the student body. A petition circulated requesting that McNamara debate with an anti-war representative and garnered more than 1,600 signatures, of which approximately 50 were from faculty members. According to The Crimson, two students even planned to dump bloody bones at the feet of the Secretary as an act of protest.</span></p> <p><span>A crowd of 700 students turned out to protest McNamara\u2019s visit, and blocked the Secretary\u2019s exit. Former Dean of the Kennedy School Graham T. Allison \u201962 had to act as a decoy, making his way through the students in a car, so that McNamara could be taken to Leverett House on foot, and then smuggled in the underground tunnels to Kirkland before he could make his escape.</span></p> <p><span>While this instance may stand out in terms of the opposition\u2019s ferocity toward the speaker, the IOP continued to bring in important and controversial speakers to engage with students.</span></p> <p><span>Anurima Bhargava \u201996, a former IOP member and current fellow, remembers being awed by the speakers that came to the forum. She recalls one instance where, within a span of a few weeks Israeli and Palestinian leaders were to come express their points of view at the Forum.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cFor me to be able to see Yasser Arafat,\u201d she said, \u201cand then two weeks later [Yitzhak] Rabin was supposed to speak, but he was assassinated in the interim.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Since its founding, the IOP has hosted international leaders, from George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton to Mikhail Gorbachev, and Aung San Suu Kyi. The Institute has also hosted individuals from the arts, including Barbra Streisand and Peter Yarrow, part of the group Peter, Paul, and Mary.</span></p> <p><span><strong>PUBLIC SERVICE, BROADLY DEFINED</strong></span></p> <p><span>Part of the Institute's mission includes a broader definition of public service than simply becoming a politician or lawmaker. According to alumni, this has had a large effect on students who have gone through the IOP, and, in particular, those who are less politically-inclined.</span></p> <p><span>Henry W. McGee III \u201974, a former Crimson editor, a member of the SAC, and longtime president of HBO\u2019s home entertainment division, was involved with the IOP, even though he knew he \u201cwas interested in public service, but not necessarily elected office.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI joined the student advisory committee not because of an interest in politics, but because of an interest in public service,\u201d he said. \u201cI turned my attention to public service in the arts, which overlapped quite strongly with President Kennedy\u2019s interest in the arts.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>For Bhargava, her time at the IOP and on the SAC also encouraged her to go into public service, although not on the politician track.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt encouraged me to pursue a career in civil rights,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think of myself as a political person....[but] I did know I wanted to fix some of the problems in my community.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>This year there is an extra focus on the relationship between public service and the arts, as Anne  Hawley, former director of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, is directing her own study group with a focus on how art can be used for both political and cultural purposes.</span></p> <p><span><strong>A TRAINING GROUND FOR POLITICIANS<br></strong></span></p> <p><span>That isn\u2019t to say, however, that the IOP hasn\u2019t seen its share of political enthusiasts. Former members of the IOP have emphasized how their time at the Institute gave them the tools and confidence they needed to pursue a career in politics and public office.</span></p> <p><span>Stefanik is a current member of Congress from upstate New York and the youngest congresswoman ever elected. She said she \u201cwas interested in public policy and engagement\u201d before she got to Harvard, but credited \u201cthe skillset that the IOP afforded\u201d her and everyone else in the program for giving her \u201cthe confidence to run for office.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt helped prepare me for the very partisan political world right now. I am very respectful of people who disagree with me, and I have a record of working across the aisle,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that has served me well in Congress.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Eric P. Lesser \u201907 was also a member of the SAC before going on to a career in politics: first working for the Obama campaign, then in the White House, and now as a Massachusetts state senator. Lesser credits the IOP for augmenting his interest in politics.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI was a Director\u2019s Intern for a summer and I taught a citizenship class in the local public schools,\u201d Lesser said. \u201cIt really opened my eyes to a group of young people who shared my belief in that the political process can be a force for good.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Gearan also went on to a long career in politics. He worked on both the Dukakis and Clinton campaigns, then served as Clinton\u2019s deputy chief of staff, head of the Peace Corps, and finally took his current position as President of Hobart and William Smith Colleges in 1999. He also emphasized the unique perspective on politics that students gain at the IOP.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think I had a window into the world of politics and public service that I don\u2019t think I would've had as just a Government major,\u201d he said. \u201cIt exposed me to debates, conversations, and individuals, and to really contemplate public service as a career.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>While the IOP has produced scores of public servants, the current race for the 8th Congressional District in Maryland stands out. Kathleen A. Matthews, an IOP fellow from 2004, and Jamie Raskin \u201983, a former IOP member, are competing for the soon-to-be-vacated seat of Congressman Chris Van Hollen, himself a Kennedy School alum.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Nathaniel J.

{"title": "The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>This Saturday, just after 7 p.m., members of a certain a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine made a feeble, short-lived attempt at humor. Earlier today, Lampoon staffers sent emails over club and House lists announcing that the Crimson president\u2019s chair would \u201cdepart on its eternal journey into Space.\u201d This was to be the latest in a long history of pranks between the two organizations, including most recently the Lampoon\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/flyby/article/2015/8/3/lampoon-prank-trump-chair/\">duping of Donald Trump</a>. </span></p> <p><span>Ever-fascinated by new advances in space exploration, we at Flyby braved the cold with high hopes of seeing new breakthroughs in chair-launching technology\u2014or at least, a mildly amusing prank. Unfortunately, we were met with neither.</span></p> <p><span>Arriving at the Lampoon\u2019s castle at 6:45 sharp, per the email\u2019s instructions, we joined a crowd of fellow Crimson writers.  Even Crimson president Mariel A. Klein \u201917 was present, decked out in purple and yellow\u2014the Lampoon\u2019s colors\u2014in anticipation of the big event.</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately, except for the Crimson squad, turnout appeared to be quite low. The small crowd huddled between Mt. Auburn and Bow Street didn\u2019t appear to be much larger than the membership of the Lampoon. (Perhaps there will be a larger turnout at the Lampoon\u2019s \u201cFarewell Chair\u201d open party tonight at 11 p.m., when people can drink until the Lampoon actually seems funny...)</span></p> <p><span>After about 10 cold minutes, a few dressed-up Lampoon members came forward and began to inflate a large white balloon. We pulled out our phones to begin <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CrimsonFlyby\">frantically live-tweeting</a>, only to realize that we would be forced to wait another 10 minutes or so for the actual prank to begin while the \u2019Poonsters struggled to tie the balloon to a poor imitation of the Crimson\u2019s chair.</span></p> <p><span>After much fanfare and anticipation (and with the balloon <em>finally</em> secured to the chair), the Lampoon set the chair free, watching as it drifted toward space.</span></p> <p><span>Just kidding\u2014the balloon, like the \u2019Poonsters' future careers in comedy, failed to launch. Only after a member picked up the \"chair\" and threw it, narrowly missing a car and breaking the chair in half, did the balloon finally escape toward a better place.</span></p> <p><span>All in all, we weren\u2019t surprised that the Lampoon\u2019s prank was a waste of time and not funny, though we do hope they\u2019ll step up their game for the next round of pranks, to prove that they aren\u2019t just full of hot air.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Amid Debate, Law School Responds to Free Speech Concerns | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Claire E. Parker", "body": "<p><span>Harvard Law School administrators amped up security and amended school policies in response to an escalating debate about free speech that began with a confrontation over posters last week.</span></p> <p><span>Students in the group Reclaim Harvard Law have occupied the Caspersen Center Student lounge\u2014which they are calling \u201cBelinda Hall\u201d\u2014since February to advocate for increased support for minority students on campus. Last Monday, third-year law student William H. Barlow, a vocal critic of Reclaim Harvard Law, <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/4/2/law-students-clash-posters/\">posted</a> signs in the lounge comparing the group to Republican presidential candidate Donald J. Trump, a move activists saw as offensive. Reclaim Harvard Law members removed the signs and told Barlow that they had  jurisdiction over what could be posted in the space.</span></p> <p><span>Barlow considered their action a violation of his right to free speech, and returned to the lounge each day for the remainder of the week to post signs with messages such as \u201cStand Against Censorship, Stand Against Reclaim.\u201d Tensions flared Friday as a group of activists confronted Barlow while he affixed signs to the walls in a stand-off Barlow described as \u201cvolatile.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The school filmed activities in the room Friday to ensure that students were complying with the policy outlined in their emails. Activists said they identified several undercover Harvard University Police Officers masquerading as admissions officers stationed in the hall watching Friday\u2019s dispute play out.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAt the request of Harvard Law School administrators HUPD assigned two plainclothes officers on a paid detail assignment due to safety concerns,\u201d Officer Steven G. Catalano wrote in an email.</span></p> <p><span>The dispute also prompted administrators to revise the school\u2019s poster policy, which states that authorized student groups are only allowed to place posters on designated bulletin boards\u2014meaning that both Reclaim Harvard Law and Barlow were violating school rules.</span></p> <p><span>But on Friday, Law School Dean Martha L. Minow sent an email to students amending the policy to establish the student lounge as a free speech zone open to all viewpoints.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe will continue to make the WCC lounge available as a temporary space for the community to engage in speech,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut that space must be available to all who wish to use it for such expression.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The morning after Minow sent her email, members of Reclaim Harvard Law entered the lounge to discover that several of their posters had been defaced with the words \u201cstop censorship.\u201d Since spring break, activists have not been sleeping in the hall and did not see the vandalism occur. Administrators declined to say whether they had identified the perpetrator. Several months ago, the school installed video cameras in Wasserstein Hall after a racially-charged incident of vandalism, but administrators did not place cameras in the adjacent lounge.</span></p> <p><span>Barlow publicly denied any involvement in the vandalism in a post on his Facebook page. Reclaim Harvard Law expressed disappointment about the incident, but did not accuse any particular student.</span></p> <p><span>Administrators have warily watched the events develop over the past week. Dean of Students Marcia L. Sells observed students debating in the lounge on Friday afternoon, and earlier that day, Minow herself visited the lounge. In her Friday email, she reminded students of the school\u2019s policy against threats and violence.</span></p> <p><span>In an email to Law School affiliates Friday, Minow warned that interfering with other students\u2019 posters would trigger disciplinary proceedings. Sells reiterated this message following the vandalism incident Saturday.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe Dean's statement yesterday made clear that defacing a sign posted by another is in the same category as removing or moving someone else's sign,\u201d Sells wrote in an email to students. \u201cThe wall space in the lounge is to be shared, on equal terms, by all members of our community. Matters are being referred to the Administrative Board as appropriate.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Amidt all of the discussion about the pragmatics of poster placement and removal, a broader debate about the meaning of free speech and inclusion has emerged.</span></p> <p><span>Activists said they can control speech in the room because they are occupying the hall and designating it a make-shift office of diversity and inclusion. Therefore, they argue, they have the right to remove signs they consider to be offensive.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis is a place made for inclusion. Inclusion doesn\u2019t mean that you let everything that anyone wants go up,\u201d Bianca S. Tylek said. \u201cInclusion means protecting from exclusion.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Activists have launched their own postering campaign under the premise \u201cfree speech is not neutral,\u201d arguing that the Law School has historically silenced minorities and Barlow\u2019s campaign about free speech is an attempt to stifle conversation about their demands.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAll of a sudden this is a distraction from that,\u201d Reclaim Harvard Law member Titilayo S. Rasaki said. \u201cTo change the conversation...[is a tactic] that has been deployed at this institution and schools around the country to silence the voices of students of color when they are challenging substantively what\u2019s going on in their institutions.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Barlow and supporters, however, view the lounge as a public space where any student has the right to express their views freely. In their opinion, activists\u2019 attempts to regulate signage amount to censorship.</span></p> <p><span>Students have taken to the pages of the Harvard Law Record to weigh in on the debate. The poster dispute has soured several students on the Reclaim Harvard Law movement, which they say they initially supported but now disapprove of activists\u2019 tactics. Marlen Thaten called the movement \u201cauthoritarian\u201d in a Record <a href=\"http://hlrecord.org/2016/04/reclaim-turn-for-worse/\">piece</a>, and third-year Law student Stephen M. Silva said activists\u2019 tactics have created a \u201cpervasive\u201d silencing effect on dissenting speech at the school.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThey decided they\u2019re going to stifle, basically, any other ideas people are going to say,\u201d Silva said in interview. \u201cI think it\u2019s very unfortunate because they have some very good ideas.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Barlow has said he will likely stop mounting signs, as he feels he has made clear his argument. Activists, on the other hand, said they are looking to broaden their postering efforts. Because administrators adopted \u201cBelinda Hall\u201d as a temporary free speech zone\u2014using the boundaries activists had drawn for their occupation\u2014Tylek said Reclaim Harvard Law might expand its physical reach.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cPerhaps we will think about redrawing our lines,\u201d Tylek said.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Claire E.

{"title": "Campaign Finance Reform Ignored in Election, Panelists Say | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Panelists at a discussion on campaign finance reform at Harvard Law School asserted that candidates in this presidential election cycle have not emphasized reform initiatives, despite public support for amending campaign finance laws.</span></p> <p><span>Sponsored by the Harvard American Constitution Society, Law School Democrats, and Law School Republicans, the Friday afternoon panel featured four panelists from across the political spectrum.</span></p> <p><span>Joseph L. Breen, an organizer of the event and student at the Harvard Kennedy School, emphasized that he wanted to demonstrate bipartisan support for campaign finance reform by having two conservative and two liberal members on the panel.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis really is bipartisan when you talk to people on the street, but for some reason when you get up into Congress, it becomes a partisan issue,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Panelists also discussed the apparent disconnect between current party officials and the electorate.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe\u2019ve had many political conservatives stand up for campaign finance reform over many years,\u201d Richard Painter, a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School who identifies as a conservative, said. \u201cAnd one of the questions we have is why not the current elected members of the House and Senate.  And the answer to that is quite clear, they are addicted to the campaign cash.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Panelists said that this year\u2019s presidential candidates have also largely ignored campaign finance reform in the public sphere.</span></p> <p><span>Max Stahl, director of political engagement at Democracy Matters, a  non-profit, said the national media\u2019s focus on polling and primary results has led to less coverage of substantive issues.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe really don\u2019t have democracy, we have this illusion of democracy. As candidates put it, politics are reported on like sports on TV,\u201d Stahl said.</span></p> <p><span>John Pudner, executive director of Take Back Our Republic, a conservative group, said although Republican frontrunner Donald J. Trump has come closest to addressing campaign finance reform, even the business tycoon has never gone beyond mentioning it as a problem.</span></p> <p><span>\"I don\u2019t think Trump has ever proposed a solution,\u201d Pudner said.</span></p> <p><span>Multiple panelists stressed the importance of campaign finance reform because it influences other political issues.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe current system of campaign finance reform does have these implications and effects on a number of issues that people may care about more personally,\u201d said Breen.</span></p> <p><span>Painter mentioned national security as one of the issues.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cCampaign finance is a national security threat because when you put global corporate wealth with first amendment free speech right to influence U.S. political campaign, we are opening up our political process to sources all over the world,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>John Polansky, a first-year law student who attended the panel, also noted the divide between the public and election candidates.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere is, just by nature of the disparity between the polling of the public and the candidates in the election, a huge issue,\u201d he said.</span></p>"}
{"title": "The Myth of Tone Policing | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>\u201cCalm down so we can discuss this like adults.\u201d<br></span></p> <p><span>Today\u2019s social activists are quick to call out the seductive, siren\u2019s call appeal of this specious argument. <a href=\"http://tooyoungforthelivingdead.tumblr.com/tone-policing\">Tone policing</a>, they claim, unfairly discounts the substance of an argument because of its presentation and prioritizes civility over truth. In his \u201cLetter from Birmingham Jail,\u201d Martin Luther King <a href=\"https://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html\">faults</a> not just the Ku Klux Klan member, but the \u201cwhite moderate, who is more devoted to \u2018order\u2019 than justice.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Their underlying point is correct: One can simultaneously be angry and rational. The elusiveness of this point perhaps explains our inability to slow down the Trump machine. Since his arrival in the political arena, the conservative intelligentsia was quick to criticize not only him, but also the movement he stands for. They confused the anger of Trump supporters for irrationality, which only made them angrier.</span></p> <p><span>As vapid as you might consider them, it\u2019s hard to make a case that their decision to vote for Trump is unsystematic and not thoughtful. Trump has outlined <a href=\"http://www.ontheissues.org/Donald_Trump.htm\">a fairly clear</a>, albeit generally unpalatable platform for his presidency\u2014a wall across the border, a freeze on funding to Planned Parenthood, a ban on refugees\u2014that is in line with the views of his voter base.</span></p> <p><span>His supporters are putting justice\u2014or at least their conception of it\u2014over order. In their eyes, the RINOs who consider any support for Trump as indefensible ipso facto fall prey to the establishment\u2019s guile of civility, baited by rhetoric that sounds polite or politically correct at the expense of a truth that may be hard to swallow.</span></p> <p><span>It\u2019s unfair to dismiss both the feminist, whose anger at the patriarchy is integral to her argument, and the Trumpist, whose fear of Muslim immigrants cannot be dismissed solely on face value.</span></p> <p><span>But where the fight against tone policing gets it wrong is that it still does not view argumentation as the most effective means to resolution. The best case for condemning tone policing is that discussion can be both rational and emotional\u2014that arguments should be considered on merits, not decorum. But the case that often gets made instead is that, in scenarios where injustice is great, discussion can be simply emotional or eschewed altogether for unilateral claims to the truth.</span></p> <p><span>A seminal piece on tone policing circulated widely and often online\u2014a <a href=\"http://everydayfeminism.com/2015/12/tone-policing-and-privilege/\">comic</a> by the blog Every Day Feminism\u2014characterizes the tactic as an exercise of privilege, a plausibly justifiable assertion, but uses this claim to attack open dialogue as a methodological approach to truth-finding. \u201cSome topics,\u201d the comic claims, \u201cdon\u2019t have two [or three, or four] equal sides, and some viewpoints don\u2019t have to be met neutrally.\u201d The graphic below this text depicts a woman asking to debate on transgender identities, to which another replies pithily, \u201cLet\u2019s not.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>It\u2019s important to be critical of systematic approaches to problems. Yet one whose reliability has withstood the test of time is the application of the competition of ideas. If ideas can never be totally proven to be correct and thus should compete for popular appeal and the claim to truth, then we should have the maturity and foresight to recognize emotion as a tool that can sometimes aid, sometimes distract from, but never replace reason. That means resisting temptations to dismiss the credibility of a claim because of the person touting it. It means taking the concerns and arguments of the Trumpist and feminist with the same critical gravity.</span></p> <p><span>But don\u2019t for a second allow anyone to exploit these problems with tone policing to forego discussion altogether. Unfettered discussion will always be truth\u2019s most rigorous trial, a scary reality for those after something less akin to truth and more to their interpretation of justice. Justice is always more important than order, but do not let the least orderly dictate the standards for justice.</span></p> <p><span><em><br></em></span></p> <p><span><em>Shubhankar Chhokra \u201918, a Crimson editorial writer, is a social studies concentrator in Eliot House.

{"title": "Ever Freer Expression | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>It has lately become fashionable to see the freedom of expression as under attack, and not entirely <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/3/29/sexual-harassment-open-discourse/\">without reason</a>. The rise of \u201csafe spaces\u201d and \u201ctrigger warnings\u201d has <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/09/the-coddling-of-the-american-mind/399356/\">prompted</a> furious <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/03/the-glaring-evidence-that-free-speech-is-threatened-on-campus/471825/\">brow-furrowing</a> by those who see the First Amendment as <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/restoring-free-speech-on-campus/2015/09/25/65d58666-6243-11e5-8e9e-dce8a2a2a679_story.html\">threatened</a>. We need not wade into the national debate about these issues to see that Harvard is <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/3/23/trump-and-satire/\">not immune</a> from concern.<br></span></p> <p><span>Last Monday brought the latest episode in this saga, as members of the Law School student activist group Reclaim Harvard Law <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/4/2/law-students-clash-posters/\">took down</a> posters equating their movement to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. The Reclaim movement\u2014which is in the name of racial equality on campus\u2014has been <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/2/22/Yale-Occidental-Join-Protests/\">occupying</a> the lounge in the Caspersen Student Center, calling it \u201cBelinda Hall\u201d after a slave owned by Law School benefactor Isaac Royall Jr., and cited the posters\u2019 potential offensiveness to Muslim law students that were to meet there.</span></p> <p><span>Throughout the week, both sides subsequently put up posters in the lounge in contravention of the Law School\u2019s no-postering policy, prompting Law School Dean Martha Minow to <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/4/4/hls-debate-over-free-speech/\">modify</a> that policy on Friday. That night, however, an as-yet-unknown individual vandalized the Reclaim group\u2019s signs with the words \u201cstop censorship.\u201d Since then, the activists and counter-activists have traded accusations of censorship: the former for removing the posters and the latter for the anonymous vandalism.</span></p> <p><span>It is important to note that, methods aside, the Reclaim movement has legitimate grievances. Though we have opposed some of their <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/12/11/staff-reclaim-hls-demands/\">demands and tactics before</a>, it is undeniable that many minority law students feel alienated from their peers and from their school. This is an unacceptable state of affairs. We are proud to attend a college and a university that strives to build an ever more inclusive campus. Harvard should be a place for students to find a home, regardless of their background or past.</span></p> <p><span>When law students say that their voices are not being heard, that deeply disturbs us. We have said before that these problems are <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/11/24/staff-hls-black-tape/\">structural</a>, and indeed they involve the composition of the faculty, the history of the school, and the culture. We are heartened that they are now being brought to the fore.</span></p> <p><span>Past oppression, however, should never serve as a rationale for its continuation in any form. The right to free expression, as messy and complicated as it might be, must never be abridged. At a basic level, a movement like Reclaim is possible because they hold the unalienable rights to speak and assemble.</span></p> <p><span>We deplore the systemic factors that cause minority law students to feel incapable of speaking out on equal terms with their classmates, but we do so precisely because such impediments harm the free exchange of ideas. The benefits of diversity are lost when certain groups, though physically present, cannot be thoroughly vocal and engaged. By failing to hear each other fully, we cannot learn from each other fully, and by not learning from each other fully, we cannot partake in full of the personal, academic, and social growth that Harvard stands for.</span></p> <p><span>The de jure protections of free speech are not a substitute to, but rather a prerequisite for, a university where students can speak on equal footing. They are not a salve that subordinates the concerns of students to blind faith in institutions, but instead the only guarantor of a more inclusive future towards which to work.</span></p> <p><span>History tells us that heavy-handed censorship rarely works to the benefit of the oppressed. Failing to uphold the societal, administrative, and legal rules that, however imperfectly used, purport to give each person an equal microphone means that we no longer have a foundation on which to seek equality. If we lack a philosophical dedication to free speech, why strive for it at all? The graffiti and the removal of posters might seem insignificant, but in fact, they signal an undermining of that commitment.</span></p> <p><span>Our present failures to achieve our high-minded ideals of genuine diversity and inclusivity are never reasons to reject our goals. Indeed, they are reasons to rededicate ourselves to them, and so too it must be with the freedom of expression.</span></p>"}

So we talked about politics\u2026 that was something really interesting. She\u2019s a Hillary supporter.

{"title": "Harvard Student Art Show Expands In Split From ARTS FIRST | Arts | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Grace Z. Li", "body": "<p><span>The eighth annual Harvard Student Art Show took place at Arts @ 29 Garden this weekend, organized for the first time as an independent event rather than as a part of ARTS FIRST weekend.  In its new home on 29 Garden Street, the exhibition spanned five rooms and two floors, with 70 pieces selected from around 230 submissions.</span></p> <p><span>Directors Isabel C. Elson \u201916 and James R. Thurm \u201916 attributed the show\u2019s change of schedule to the necessity of expanding the opportunities for Harvard students to engage with the arts. \u201cIt was sort of sad that there was just one weekend dedicated all year to the arts at Harvard,\u201d Elson says. \u201cI think it definitely should be spread out over the year. It\u2019s not as if people only care about art for one weekend a year at Harvard.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Thurm also ascribed this change to a difficult history of competition for limited space on campus. In previous years, the Harvard Student Art Show has taken place above the Cambridge Trust Company and the basement of CGIS Knafel. Both spaces were not ideal for showing art, especially when complications for hanging or displaying the art arose from facility restrictions. \u201cOur goal this year was to get a space we could really own as ours,\u201d Thurm says. \u201cWe also had total freedom to use the space as we liked,\u201d Elson adds.</span></p> <p><span>At 29 Garden Street, photographs and paintings lined the walls as attendants weaved through sculpture after sculpture, snacking on cheese and wine. The stories behind the pieces from 38 visual artists ranged from political to personal to scientific. \u201cWe really wanted to get a sense of the arts across campus\u2026 giving Harvard students a sample about what they\u2019re thinking about, what they\u2019re making,\u201d Elson says. One piece titled \u201cFamily\u201d by George T. Liu \u201919 considered the relationship between his identity as a queer Asian and idealized concepts of a perfect family. Another painting called \u201c24 Trump Pinatas,\u201d by Paul D. Fiegenschue of the Graduate School of Design, depicted 24 papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 renditions of presidential candidate Donald Trump on a single canvas. Javier A. Masis of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences put up seven pictures of coronal slices of a rat\u2019s brain next to a actual rat\u2019s brain immortalized in resin. The Harvard Student Art Show\u2019s eclectic collection invites the audience to explore a wide variety of art of different mediums and stories from artists affiliated with different schools within the University.</span></p> <p><span>The Harvard Student Art Show also expanded beyond the visual arts this year, including performances for the first time in many years. \u201cOur goal is to have a lively space,\u201d Thurm says. \u201cWe\u2019re having all the performances in the gallery itself.\u201d Performances included shows by groups such as the Harvard Ballet Company, the Harvard Lowkeys, and the Lighthouse Keepers, and by individuals singing with the acoustic guitar, or playing yangqin, a Chinese hammered dulcimer. Nick J. Stager \u201916, a performance artist, had a space to himself as he wrote continuously, ensconced behind glass, on a typewriter for the entirety of the art show.</span></p> <p><span>Artists, as usual, were also given the option of selling their work. \u201cSelling your work is a part of being an artist. It\u2019s some level of being able to sustain your next piece and continue to create and fund your passion,\u201d Thurm says. \u201cWe want to be able to provide that opportunity.\u201d Prices could be as low as $5 or as high as $2,500.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe goal is to give student artists a place to showcase their work. There isn\u2019t a lot of space to do that,\u201d Thurm says. \u201cWe also want the community to interact with art more.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Grace Z.

{"title": "The Laugh Track | Arts | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><strong>UPDATED: April 13, 2016, at 3:51 p.m.</strong></span></p> <p><span>With a crowd of smiling faces surrounding him, Conan C. O\u2019Brien \u201985 brandished his Sharpie to sign the enlarged poster of his face that graces Mather\u2019s Junior Common Room. While on campus this February for a public appearance with Drew Faust, O\u2019Brien returned to his former House and met current students. He spoke teasingly about Mather\u2019s relative ugliness and his roommate, who would celebrate a finished problem set by shouting the nonsense term, \u201cFoom!\u201d Though the few jokes he told were impromptu, the small crowd of people seemed highly entertained. This reaction is the kind of electricity professional comedians look for.</span></p> <p><span>In a 2011 piece for The New Yorker, ostensibly dispensing advice for crafting late-night television, Tina Fey wrote, \u201cWhen hiring, mix Harvard nerds with Chicago improvisers and stir.\u201d But what would happen if you mixed Harvard nerds with Harvard improvisers? A quick glance at Harvard\u2019s extensive humor-minded community reveals that Harvard is home to a bit more than academic wit. Students who pursue comedy with passion seem to bounce off one another, supplementing the universal appeal of a good joke by uniting economics and English concentrators. Though comedy entails a somewhat unconventional career path, Harvard graduates have entered the entertainment industry for years. What is new and original, however, is the current diversity of options for on-campus comedy. For a broader spectrum of comedians, Harvard abounds in opportunities to improve both written and stage humor. Aware as they are of the inherent status as Harvard students, comic artists here express true passion for their extracurricular interests. Comedians on campus are not inherently funnier than comedians elsewhere; they love comedy just as much as any other up-and-coming humorist. Harvard just happens to be the community through which they express that passion. They are organizing shows, dreaming up new joke concepts, and assembling fresh stand-up routines. Humor is entertaining, but entertainment is hard work.</span></p> <p><span>Stand-up comics are generally considered solo artists, but like most art forms, comedy thrives in a communal atmosphere. Sierra L. Katow \u201916, an active member of Harvard\u2019s comedy scene, grew up outside L.A. Starting at age 16, she would often travel into the city to perform at shows, forming a personal attachment to the craft of comedy. \u201cComedians often like to think that their way of comedy is the way,\u201d Katow says. \u201cPeople think: \u2018This is funny, and this is not. Some people are born with it, some are not.\u2019 And I don\u2019t believe in that. I think it\u2019s really important to know that comedy is so contextualized by who you are and who other people are.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>For the first part of her freshman year, however, Katow found it difficult to understand her role as a comedian. After auditioning for several campus improv troupes, she failed to secure a spot in any group. But by joining other organizations like On Harvard Time and the Harvard College Stand Up Comic Society, she gradually determined how to work among Harvard comics. Now a member of the Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine, she is highly visible as a campus comic, performing at events like the Lampoon\u2019s roast of late-night TV mainstay Jimmy Fallon last semester.</span></p> <p><span><br></span></p> <p><span>Other students, however, arrive on campus with no professional experience in performing comedy. Julia N. Becerra \u201916 professes herself to be such a student, stumbling upon OHT at Visitas four years ago and spending her first couple of semesters marching up to the Quad to OHT\u2019s now non-existent studio. While becoming a correspondent for OHT requires an audition, the comp processes for writing, editing, and directing are relatively effort-based: members are never cut. \u201cPeople are so intimidated when I try to get them to come,\u201d Becerra says. \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018Oh everyone\u2019s gonna be so funny and judge me if I\u2019m not funny.\u2019 [OHT members] literally don\u2019t care. They are so surprisingly supportive of everyone.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Along with her work for OHT, Becerra practices stand-up routines with the Harvard College Stand Up Comic Society.  Even though she admits struggling to balance problem sets with practice time, Becerra believes that the time she invests in her comedy skills is time well-spent. Katow echoes this need for consistency and determination. \u201cThere\u2019s such a high standard here for people doing well right away,\u201d she says. \u201cThe interesting thing about comedy is you have to work at it so long because you have to live your life. It takes so many years to find your voice and find your following. If you\u2019re not able to get that when you\u2019re 20, it\u2019s okay.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In addition to the exquisitely crafted stand-up routines, shows featuring intricately constructed improvisational humor occur most weekends on campus. The three most visible groups\u2014the Immediate Gratification Players, On Thin Ice, and Three Letter Acronym\u2014frequently hold performances that feature improv techniques practiced by a wide variety of students.<br></span></p> <p><span>Karen L. Chee \u201917, the Czar (in other words, president) of IGP, describes the troupe\u2019s performances as a style of long-form improv called free-form montage. The audience volunteers a single word suggestion, and then IGP comedians use the word as inspiration for the entire show, creating a number of characters and relating them spontaneously. Chee says what makes a great show is its collaborative, relational aspect. \u201cWhen you\u2019re on stage, the whole point isn\u2019t for you to stand out as a performer or for you to get the limelight,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s to support the other person and justify what they\u2019re saying and make them look great.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Chee did not expect to feel an immediate connection with her fellow improv actors, but she now considers them her family. A history and literature concentrator, Chee says that her dream job would be to eventually continue with comedy, preferably on a television show as a showrunner or writer, with a small acting part. But even as she contemplates her future, she recognizes the exclusivity of extracurricular improvisatory organizations. \u201cThere are very few spaces for you to just try something for fun, to learn something for the first time,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have to already be at a certain level.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Alexander N. Lee \u201917, an English concentrator, certainly had already reached that level before arriving on campus. After taking classes with the famous Upright Citizens Brigade the summer before coming to Harvard, Lee joined TLA his freshman year, initially as an extracurricular interest. He now serves as the Pirate for TLA, or their business manager (their administrative titles are nautically themed). Originally founded for a specific type of structured performance known as The Harold, TLA  now focuses on long-form improv. According to Lee, while they do hold semesterly shows for students, their genuine passion for comedy outweighs any need for public interest. \u201cA lot of members of the group would tell you that we do improv for ourselves, not for our audiences,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have shows because we are an improv group, but I think a lot of members would be totally fine not even performing, just doing improv among ourselves.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>All the world\u2019s a stage, but not all humor is performative. That is to say, since 1998, Satire V has presented mostly written comedy. \u201cIn Satire V, there are no bylines. You\u2019re writing in the voice of Satire V. You\u2019re sort of removing yourself from the process,\u201d says Daniel J. Kenny \u201918, the publication\u2019s editor-in-chief.</span></p> <p><span>As a government concentrator, Kenny sought out Satire V as a publication that could combine politics and comedy. The writing process, which features open member pitch meetings, is very inclusive but is also different from stand-up or most video sketches. \u201cThe joke is written out for people to read for as many times as possible. So it has to be written according to a news formula,\u201d Kenny says. \u201cNot to say that we constrict our writers, but there\u2019s a way that it has to go along so that if you\u2019re writing an area man piece, it can be read potentially five years from now and people will find it funny.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>As a primarily online publication, graphics are often key to articles published in Satire V. Antonia Chan \u201918, current president of Satire V, started out as a graphics editor. \u201cIf someone emailed me being like, you know, \u2018Marijuana was just legalized in DC. We need a picture of Elizabeth Warren smoking a blunt, \u2018[I would be] like, OK!\u201d Despite the fact that Satire V has a unified voice and platform, Chan never felt like an outsider upon joining the organization\u2014her first attempt at comedy. \u201cI think there\u2019s a very refreshing lack of ego,\u201d Chan says. \u201cEveryone is in it because they love to do what they do.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><br></span></p> <p><span>After ushering in its largest comp class ever last fall, Satire V brought back its video component this semester with the notable parody of a Housing Day video for Dudley House. This year also marks the opening of Satire V\u2019s second annual spring musical, \u201cThe Tragedy of Macbeth, King of Pop.\u201d For Kenny, however, Satire V is always about improving the organization as Harvard\u2019s version of The Onion. \u201cMy goal is not to antagonize the Lampoon but rather to democratize comedy,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>In the wake of ongoing conversation about <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/12/1/house-masters-consider-title/\">institutionalized language</a> and censorship such as <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/3/10/currier-removes-trump-video/\">the recent takedown of Currier\u2019s Trump-themed housing day video</a>, a<a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/2/3/students-debate-political-correctness/\"> number of Harvard students have voiced their opinions on political correctness</a>. According to Becerra, policing language is not the point. \u201cI\u2019m not against offensive jokes, right,\u201d Becerra says. \u201cBut I think it matters to what end.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Becerra links the idea of positivity with constructive humor, in which students can perhaps obtain a higher level of comedy than the bare basics of stereotype or weak satire. OHT, for example, impressed Becerra with its gender spread. \u201cThe head writer was a woman; one or two of the producers were women,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was usually at least half women in the writers\u2019 room, and I remember noting to myself, \u2018I bet this isn\u2019t that common.\u2019 That makes me really happy.\u201d Such a standard both makes comedy groups more inclusive and lends more complexity to joke structures. In meetings, Becerra says, women might challenge misogynistic humor, pushing for jokes that move beyond stereotypes.</span></p> <p><span>Groups are also doing their part to remain informed about the topics they approach in their shows. Even though improv is mostly an anything-goes affair, Lee says that TLA recognizes how language can shape someone\u2019s experience of a performance. \u201cWe had a workshop recently with representatives from the Women\u2019s Center,\u201d he says. \u201cSo we can learn about gender issues and approach gender and sexuality in a more informed way in our comedy.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><span class=\"redactor-invisible-space\"></span></span></p> <p dir=\"ltr\" rel=\"line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\" style=\"line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">Becoming the Harvard Nerd That A Late Night Show Could Love<span></span></p> <p><span>Becoming the Harvard Nerd That A Late Night Show Could Love<span></span></span></p> <p><span> <br></span></p> <p><span>Gus A. Mayopoulos \u201915, who is pursuing comedy as a profession, is currently learning how to write humor now that he\u2019s away from campus. Mayopoulos, who was infamous on campus for his gig as president of the Undergraduate Council, found that his humorous presidency appealed to many people. According to Mayopoulos, he hoped to transform the issues the UC discussed into politics that students were talking about\u2014similar to the punditry of television personalities like Stephen Colbert and John Oliver. \u201cJoking about [political] things helps make them more palatable to be consumed by these [people who are] really busy with their own lives,\u201d he says.<br></span></p> <p><span>But the journey from pursuing comedy as an undergraduate extracurricular to undertaking it as full-time employment can be daunting\u2014much like any other career. Now taking improv classes, Mayopoulos is discovering how much more he has to learn. \u201cIt sort of comes back to Harvard,\u201d he says. \u201cLike, at Harvard, we all held ourselves to these very high standards. And now that I\u2019m trying something else, I\u2019m trying to hold myself to that standard. The problem is, how do you get yourself there?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The network of Harvard graduates currently working on either comedic high-profile television shows or online writing gigs seems enormous. Alumni such as Megan L. Amram \u201910 and Alexandra A. Petri \u201910 write humorous content online\u2014Amram on Twitter and Petri on her Washington Post blog, Compost (Petri is the pop-culture mastermind behind the Emo Kylo Ren Twitter account). The Theatre and Entertainment Meet-up, held on Feb. 6 this year, attracted more than 100 students to an event featuring a large panel of contemporary professionals and a networking brunch. Furthermore, in addition to on-campus events, OCS encourages comedy-minded students to use Harvardwood as a resource. Formed initially as a networking website for alumni, Harvardwood now exists as a vibrant community for both graduates already working in the industry and students looking to forge their own paths.</span></p> <p><span>But the OCS knows that it cannot offer the final solution in an industry where a lot of connections are happenstance and spontaneous. \u201cYou have to road-test a lot of these things to really know,\u201d says Deborah Carroll, associate director of the OCS. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in school, whether that\u2019s your K-12 education or in college, there\u2019s a lot of things\u2026 that are sort of prescribed. When you\u2019re in the working world, it\u2019s much more self-driven.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>It is important to note that most of the comics involved with organizations on campus already possess that kind of motivation. Though the Harvard network does exist, it is up to the students to get up on stage. \u201cYou have to do the work,\u201d says Robin Mount, director of career, research, and international opportunities at OCS. \u201cYou have to do the research yourself and piece it together. And we can just help you.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>While comedy at its core is about having fun, those who identify as comedians on campus are far more serious about their craft. The goal is not to tell a good joke; it is to become a skilled performer who can turn any topic into a moment of laughter. These students thrive due to the variety of organizations that bring people together to exercise their sense of humor. It seems like a simple task\u2014finding people to jest with\u2014but finding the right fit requires substantially more effort.</span></p> <p><span><br></span></p> <p><span>And as these students follow this path and define their own ideas of comedy, they embark on their own journeys into professional life. Some may enter the entertainment business, as graduates like O\u2019Brien or upcoming Class Day speaker Rashida L. Jones \u201997 have done. Others may enter other careers and bring their comedic craft to other parts of their life. Becerra, for example, referenced the importance of comedy in community building, such as on First-Year Outdoor Program trips. \u201cIt\u2019s so important... especially if you\u2019re doing something that requires people to be challenged,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you\u2019re hiking 10 miles\u2026 and it\u2019s all uphill, and you\u2019re a freshman, and you\u2019re really scared, and you don\u2019t know if you\u2019re [going to] make friends\u2014it helps if someone can make a joke that makes you feel comfortable.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Students comedians are bonded together by this need to ease away from term-time gravity. More than simply comfort, Kenny says, comedy at Harvard is about letting off steam in productive ways: \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m interested in: when people look to comedy to give them an outlet for truth where they don\u2019t have to be so serious.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Bridget R.

{"title": "Florida is Everything | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>For the <a href=\"http://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/30-rocks-best-florida-jokes-6390778\">characters</a> of 30 Rock, Florida is a m\u00e9lange of conservative Cubans, Jewish retirees, serial killers, secretly gay Disney princes, bus passengers who ran out of money, swamp people, and pirates. For author Tim Dorsey, it\u2019s the state where prosthetic legs covered in Willie Nelson bumper stickers regularly wash ashore. And for Marco Rubio, it\u2019s a last-chance opportunity to convince the American people that he is a feasible alternative to the unstoppable Trump juggernaut\u2014and, far more consequentially, that the Republican party can still be the flagship of an increasingly and perhaps irretrievably populist, pseudo-conservative American right.</span></p> <p><span>Rubio, who spent his Super Tuesday in Miami, presumably realizes the high stakes of the Florida primary. Unlike most of the previous ones, Florida\u2019s is a winner-take-all competition with just shy of 100 delegates up for grabs. Perhaps more important than the prospect of doubling his paltry delegate count, a Rubio victory here would play into the theme of momentum that the Senator\u2019s team has so strategically pushed to cover his meager showing in elections so far\u2014Rubio\u2019s electability shouldn\u2019t be discounted because of his losses of the past, but bolstered by his potential for success in the future. The Florida primary is also critical because it answers a question that perhaps Rubio doesn\u2019t want answered: If he cannot win in his home state, where can<em> </em>he?</span></p> <p><span>That last question is a scary one. Trump is trouncing Rubio by a comfortable margin in the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/25/bad-news-for-marco-rubio-trump-leads-him-by-16-in-a-new-poll-of-florida/\">polls</a>, beating him in all demographics except, strikingly, the college-educated. To Rubio\u2019s credit, Florida Republicans are an eclectic bunch\u2014unlike their Southern brethren, they are not mostly white evangelicals, who are Trump\u2019s most consistent supporters. Rubio is specifically targeting the strong conservative Cuban population of south Florida, a community he spent his childhood with and whose favor he is desperately attempting to curry. Throughout the Florida campaign trail, Rubio has highlighted the <a href=\"http://www.latinpost.com/articles/116148/20160222/latino-gop-congressional-lawmakers-who-endorsed-jeb-bush-have-jumped-ship-to-marco-rubio.htm\">endorsement</a> of his campaign by three Latino Congressmen from Southern Florida as well as Florida\u2019s <a href=\"http://miamiherald.typepad.com/nakedpolitics/2016/02/marco-rubios-florida-endorsement-list-is-now-quite-long.html\">Lieutenant Governor</a> Carlos Lopez-Cantera.</span></p> <p><span>Although it\u2019s tempting to consider that Cruz\u2019s Hispanic heritage and Kasich\u2019s establishment appeal could steal Florida from Rubio, the Florida senator doesn\u2019t even beat Trump in a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/25/bad-news-for-marco-rubio-trump-leads-him-by-16-in-a-new-poll-of-florida/\">simulated</a> head-to-head competition, invalidating the popular argument that the Republican field is facing a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/compost/wp/2016/02/24/the-gops-trump-prisoners-dilemma/\">Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma</a>. Far from an asset as a drop-out, Kasich will be fighting a similarly pivotal winner-take-all battle in Ohio the same day Rubio does in Florida, and will likely face an easier albeit still <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/oh/ohio_republican_presidential_primary-4077.html\">uphill battle</a> against Trump in his home state. A Kasich victory in Ohio would aid Rubio in slowing down the Trump machine.</span></p> <p><span>What a disheartening endgame, slowing down the Trump machine is. It implies the delay of the inevitable\u2014the slow bleeding of a dying party\u2014which begs the question, is it finally time to pull the trigger?</span></p> <p><span>This is why Florida is so important\u2014it\u2019s less a battle for candidates and more one for ideologies. If Trump wins, conservatism loses. If Trump loses, all that it will demonstrate is that conservative leaders can convincingly pretend that they share the principles and priorities of a now-unrecognizable base. I was never one who celebrated Pyrrhic victory, so perhaps Florida is hardly a battle at all.</span></p> <p><span>Florida\u2019s importance lies in its meaninglessness. It is a sign of a party approaching its telos, a harbinger of a radical reinterpretation of American conservatism. One state will make the trivial distinction between a man unfit to lead an irate and weary party that is Republican only by name and a man unfit to lead any party whatsoever. The day Trump gets the nomination is the day I leave the Republican Party. The day Rubio gets it is the day I sit and think long and hard about whether I belong in a party for which Florida made the difference between him and someone like Trump. Chances are, I\u2019ll leave the Republican Party in that case too.</span></p> <p><span><br></span></p> <p><span><em>Shubhankar Chhokra \u201918, a Crimson editorial writer, is a social studies concentrator in Eliot House.

Faust extolled Harvard\u2019s broad societal value to hundreds of alumni and affiliates gathered on campus Tuesday night.</span></p> <p><span>The event, boasting more than 750 guests in Burden Hall at the Business School, was the latest in a series of \u201cYour Harvard\u201d alumni gatherings around the country and world; Faust has made similar appearances in <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/11/10/faust-fundraising-tour-southeast/\">Atlanta</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/5/15/intrepid-alumni-new-york/?page=single\">New York,</a> <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/3/17/faust-visits-chinese-president/\">Beijing</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/10/24/faust-travels-mexico-dallas/\">Mexico City</a>.</span></p> <p><span>As of October, Harvard had <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/10/27/harvard-will-not-raise-goal/\">raised</a> $6.1 billion of its $6.5 billion goal, and while Faust did not say on Tuesday how much Harvard had raised since then, she elucidated some of the campaign\u2019s goals and accomplishments so far. Harvard has raised $730 million towards financial aid during the campaign, according to Faust.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe gather tonight to celebrate what we have achieved in the campaign so far, what you and more than 126,000 households around the world have already made possible,\u201d Faust, clad in a crimson-colored suit jacket, said to the room full of alumni, donors, and potential donors. \u201cWe build on the generosity and ingenuity of those who came before us, those who over centuries have strengthened Harvard for an unknown and uncertain future. Like them, we must be willing to push further and reach higher as Harvard has uniquely equipped us to do.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Faust specifically highlighted renovating the College\u2019s 12 undergraduate Houses, building Harvard\u2019s Allston campus, and increasing financial aid. Over the past few years, Harvard has been systematically renovating decades-old residential housing at the College\u2014renewal will begin in Winthrop House this summer. But fundraising for the House renewal initiative has progressed <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/9/18/capital-campaign-6-bil/\">relatively slower</a> than other priorities in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences campaign, according to a September report.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe need to build, renovate, and maintain spaces worthy of the students and faculty who populate them,\u201d Faust said. \u201cAnd this campaign is helping us to do that. House renewal has breathed new life into old Quincy House\u2014now Stone Hall\u2014Leverett House, and Dunster House.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Faust\u2019s speech, largely focused on the importance of the research university, was not without some levity\u2014she poked fun at Yale University as she underscored Harvard\u2019s progress over the last few years.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cCS50, an introduction to computer science, is one of the most popular courses, and it\u2019s so undeniably good that Yale gave up on teaching introductory computer science and uses our course,\u201d she said to laughs.</span></p> <p><span>Before Faust took the stage, a panel featuring Government professor Danielle S. Allen and University Professor Douglas A. Melton explored the ethical implications of modern biological and gene editing science. Neal Baer, who graduated from several Harvard graduate schools and has worked in television, facilitated the wide-ranging and intellectual discussion.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with The Crimson before the event began, Baer said that the large \u201cYour Harvard\u201d alumni \u201cwere one of a multitude of ways that Harvard reaches out to alums.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cBut certainly I think this a good way to do it,\u201d he said. \u201c<span class=\"redactor-invisible-space\"></span>To get the leading voices in front of 750 people is pretty great.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Others, though, were trying to engage alumni for different purposes. In addition to some of the University\u2019s most prominent alumni and power brokers, a group of protesters <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/3/2/Harvard-club-workers-hold-Trump-inspired-rally/\">showed</a> up outside the event to criticize the Harvard Club of Boston\u2019s employment practices.</span></p> <p><span>Michael D. Lewis \u201993, who attended the event, had similar praises to Baer's. For alumni removed from the day-to-day of Harvard\u2019s research and work, the academic panel was particularly interesting, Lewis said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think for a lot of the alumni once you leave the university environment you don\u2019t have a sense of who the faculty are and what they\u2019re doing outside of the superstars whose names you see in the news all the time,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cBut this is an event that gives you a sense of the kind of work being done and kinds of people who are doing it. I feel energized by it.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>After Faust\u2019s speech, many alumni headed over to Shad Hall, also on the Business School campus, for what a brochure advertised as a \u201cfestive party.\u201d</span></p>"}

Now.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>This rally comes in the midst of a strained negotiation process between the union and the Club administration. Last December, over 300 undergraduates along with workers from the Club <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/12/11/students-union-harvard-club/\">submitted a petition</a> to University Provost Alan M.

{"title": "\u200b\u201cYou Can\u2019t Vote Here.\" | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>I didn\u2019t vote on Super Tuesday. It wasn\u2019t out of laziness, apathy, or protest, but simply first-time voter inexperience. Yet while voters from twelve states flocked (<a href=\"http://www.electproject.org/2016P\">or rather, trickled</a>) to the polls for the Super Tuesday primaries, thousands are disenfranchised every time they try to vote by anti-democratic efforts aimed at excluding them from our political process.<br></span></p> <p><span>I\u2019d always thought voter registration was only a problem for underprivileged districts, suppressed by whatever local establishment had the most to gain by minimizing turnout. I, on the other hand, had it made: I would be voting in Cambridge, raised on 19 years of NPR or BBC, and fresh from a summer internship in the Senate. I\u2019d watched every Presidential debate and my most-played iTunes clip was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbM2F-cfN0A\">a dubstep remix of Trump saying \u201cChina.\u201d</a> How could I possibly mess this up?</span></p> <p><span>And yet at the polling station in the Quincy courtyard 15 minutes before class on Super Tuesday, what was supposed to be my first vote as an adult American became a lesson in personal ineptitude and the ridiculously baroque nature of our system.</span></p> <p><span>After one of the women who had taken a day off work to volunteer at the polls couldn\u2019t find my name on a list of about twenty registered students from Leverett (why so few?!), she asked for my ID\u2014a Massachusetts driver\u2019s license\u2014and went to \u201cphone the election.\u201d She returned a moment later: \u201cYou\u2019re registered at your home address. You can\u2019t vote here.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>I asked if I could do a same-day switch. Not possible. Get an absentee ballot? Too late. She gave me a form to change districts in time for the general. I briefly considered catching the 6:15pm ferry to Martha\u2019s Vineyard before the polls closed at 8pm.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cYou knew this,\u201d said my Mum on the phone as I rushed to class. But I didn\u2019t. Somehow, a short lifetime of political engagement had left me with the assumption that absentee ballots were only for people from outside the state. And when I checked the online registration system I\u2019d used a few weeks earlier, nowhere on the application or confirmation had it instructed me.</span></p> <p><span>I expect that much of my confusion\u2014beyond what can be attributed to mere stupidity\u2014arose from my Australian childhood. Australia has <a href=\"http://www.aec.gov.au/Voting/Compulsory_Voting.htm\">mandatory voting</a> and Election Day is always on <a href=\"http://www.aec.gov.au/voting/your_vote.htm\">a weekend or national holiday</a>, so that most people don\u2019t have to take time off work to participate in democracy. I remember a Saturday on a beach just north of Sydney when Mum dragged herself off her towel to vote at a booth on the edge of the sand, surrounded by citizens emerging fresh from the surf to fulfill a civic duty. It would have been harder to find a bathroom than a polling place: even the habitually tuned out tune in, for a few moments. And they get counted. As a result, participation in Australian elections <a href=\"http://www.idea.int/vt/countryview.cfm?id=15\">tops 95 percent</a>. In the United States, <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/05/06/u-s-voter-turnout-trails-most-developed-countries/\">only half</a> of eligible voters make it to the polls.</span></p> <p><span>In many American districts, voting isn\u2019t made difficult so much by personal error as by intentional obfuscation, often stemming from racial bias. American voting has a long and painful history that began before Jim Crow laws that weren\u2019t struck down until 1965 and continues today with voter suppression tactics that disenfranchise swathes of the population for political gain.</span></p> <p><span>These tactics take many forms. Last week, the <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/aclu-sues-kansas-voter-registration-rules-requiring-proof-citizenship-2313732\">American Civil Liberties Union sued Kansas</a> for illegally requiring tens of thousands of citizens to provide additional documentation of citizenship when registering to vote. Similar cases have been brought in Georgia and Alabama, the source of the <a href=\"http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/shelby-county-v-holder/\">2013 Supreme Court decision</a> that eliminated many of the hard-won protections of the Voting Rights Act. These efforts, often in response to <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/issues/voter-fraud\">virtually nonexistent voter fraud</a>, disproportionately target minorities and contribute to socioeconomic inequality. While there are many potential threats to democracy from big money in politics to NSA surveillance, flaws in voter registration and difficulty getting to a polling place on a workday are the most direct way in which our country fails to live up to its egalitarian principles.</span></p> <p><span>Am I a fool for not knowing that I needed an absentee ballot? Yes. Is my situation better than millions of Americans whose votes are intentionally prevented? Of course. But should voting ever be any more difficult than absolutely necessary for any American? No. Perhaps even more important than Citizens United or iPhone privacy is a system that makes voting as easy as possible for as many people as possible, regardless of race or district. In the meantime, I\u2019ll be changing my address.</span></p> <p><span><em><br></em></span></p> <p><span><em>Nathaniel Brooks Horwitz '18, an inactive Crimson editorial writer, is a molecular and cellular biology and philosophy joint-concentrator living in Leverett House.</em></span></p>"}

Clinton and businessman Donald J. Trump.</span></p> <p><span>Clinton won the Democratic primaries in seven states, topping Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s four states. Among Clinton\u2019s victories was Massachusetts, which exit polls predicted would be hotly contested. On the Republican side, Trump won seven states, including Massachusetts, while losing Alaska, Texas, and Oklahoma to Senator Ted Cruz and Minnesota to Senator Marco Rubio.</span></p> <p><span>Super Tuesday's results are historically a strong indicator of the eventual presidential nominee for both parties. Harvard professors agree this year\u2019s race is unlikely to be any different. </span></p> <p><span>\u201cBarring some extraordinary revelation or action on the part of either Clinton or Trump, their road to the nomination is much, much easier,\u201d Harvard Kennedy School professor Thomas E. Patterson said. \u201cThis has been a campaign of surprises, so there could be a bombshell tomorrow, but barring such an event, just look at the delegate count.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Harvard Students for Hillary were \u201cpleasantly surprised\u201d by the results across all the states that voted on Tuesday and optimistic about the campaign, the group\u2019s outreach captain Michael K. Kikukawa \u201917 said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think Super Tuesday spells well for the rest of the nomination,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s in the bag for her yet, because I don\u2019t think it is. It will be a fight for the next few weeks or so for both sides to amass enough delegates to say they are the nominee.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>According to Massachusetts voting results, Clinton did better in the Cambridge area compared to her overall results in the state, which Kikukawa said  could be thanks to some of the work Harvard Students for Hillary have put into Clinton\u2019s campaign, such as <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/2/26/students-campaign-super-tuesday/\">canvassing and phone-banking</a>.</span></p> <p><span>Still,  <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/2/1/students-man-phone-banks-for-Sanders/\">Harvard Students for Bernie</a> President He Li \u201916 is still optimistic about the future of the senator\u2019s campaign.</span></p> <p><span>\u201c[Sanders] definitely held up in the states we thought he had a good shot in. Obviously we wish he would\u2019ve done a little better in the states he lost,\u201d Li said.</span></p> <p><span>Li said the student group will continue to phone-bank in upcoming states and may organize a canvassing trip up to Maine ahead of its caucuses.</span></p> <p><span>Government professor Harvey C. Mansfield Jr. \u201953 said Tuesday\u2019s results were in line with his predictions.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI thought that Hillary Clinton had the best chance, and that the Democrats would put an end to their flirtation with Bernie Sanders,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>On the Republican side, Tuesday was especially successful for Trump, who further solidified his popularity among constituents.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cSuper Tuesday showed that his coalition has a deep and broad base of support,\u201d Carlos E. Diaz Rosillo, a government lecturer who teaches Government 1359: \u201cThe Road to the White House,\u201d said.</span></p> <p><span>Super Tuesday did not bode well for some undergraduate Republicans who <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/2/1/college-republicans-uneasy-trump/\">reject Trump</a>. Rubio, a <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/2/25/harvard-republicans-jeb-campaign/\">Harvard Republican favorite</a>, won only one state, Minnesota. Nonetheless, Cameron K. Khansarinia \u201918, national co-chair of Students for Rubio, said he is optimistic about the results.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf you look at the polls going in, we outperformed in nearly every single state. I think the only state we didn\u2019t was in Texas, and of course congratulations to Cruz on that win,\u201d Khansarinia said.</span></p> <p><span>In order to challenge Trump\u2019s popularity, Patterson said Cruz or Rubio would have to drop out of the race.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThey really need a two person race to have a shot, but they\u2019re both still standing,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Overall, many students and professors agreed that Tuesday was primarily a big night for Trump.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think Super Tuesday meant looming disaster with the nomination of Trump for the presidency,\u201d Mansfield said. \u201cIt gives me the shivers to think of Trump as our president.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Kabir K.

{"title": "Crazy | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><strong>UPDATED: March 3, 2016, at 6:03 p.m.</strong><br></span></p> <p><span>Women are crazy.</span></p> <p><span>This is a common refrain heard in the media, popular culture, and everyday conversation. From <a href=\"http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/drake/bitchiscrazy.html\">song</a> lyrics about how \u201cbitch is crazy,\u201d to movie and television <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl\">depictions</a> of women as clingy and jealous, to <a href=\"http://brobible.com/life/article/5-signs-youre-dating-crazy-chick/\">the</a> <a href=\"http://www.askmen.com/top_10/dating/signs-she-s-crazy_10.html\">many</a> <a href=\"http://wallstreetinsanity.com/50-signs-youre-dating-a-crazy-chick/\">articles</a> teaching men how to tell if a woman is \u201c<a href=\"http://totalfratmove.com/how-to-tell-if-shes-batshit-crazy/\">batshit crazy</a>,\u201d we as a society have thoroughly internalized the concept of labeling women as \u201cinsane.\u201d<br></span></p> <p><span>Using mental illness as an insult, however, is concerning. Not only does it contribute to societal <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=IInCBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT225&amp;lpg=PT225&amp;dq=society+it+is+unattractive+to+express+emotion&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YH2nlOwrsr&amp;sig=zWFthrmyNFyY8W74OMUVLjp1vOI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjT_PvnmqPLAhUKyYMKHW28Bh0Q6AEIMjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=society%20it%20is%20unattractive%20to%20express%20emotion&amp;f=false\">expectations</a> that prevent men and women from expressing their emotions in constructive ways, it is also incredibly inconsiderate and <a href=\"http://everydayfeminism.com/2014/09/mental-illness-vs-sexism/\">stigmatizing</a> to those who do have mental illness by suggesting that they deserve to be mocked or dismissed.</span></p> <p><span>Furthermore, women are not any more emotional, illogical, or \u201ccrazy\u201d than men. <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022399901001982\">Studies</a> have shown that men and women exhibit similar emotional responses to comparable situations, and <a href=\"http://www.refinery29.com/2014/09/75146/stop-women-crazy-emotions-gender\">research</a> has also shown that women tend to be better at emotion regulation than men. So why does the stereotype of crazy women persist?</span></p> <p><span>The idea that women are crazy is nothing new. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3480686/\">Hysteria</a> was the first mental disorder attributed to women, introduced by the Egyptians in 1900 BC. It was a catch-all disorder used to explain any number of <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/media/2012/05/hysteria-sex-toy-history-timeline?utm_source=huffingtonpost.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=pubexchange_article\">symptoms</a> including anxiety, irritability, erotic fantasies, or even excessive vaginal lubrication. Hysteria was allegedly caused by a <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/05/fantastically-wrong-wandering-womb/\">wandering womb</a>\u2014literally, a womb that moved around in a woman\u2019s body. And although it seems laughably antiquated and unscientific now, hysteria <a href=\"http://time.com/22004/how-to-not-sound-like-a-sexist-jerk-even-if-youre-a-woman/\">continued</a> to be a valid medical diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders until as late as 1980.</span></p> <p><span>And even today, we continue to hear women being described as hysterical. Hillary Clinton, for example, was described as \u201c<a href=\"http://www.dailywire.com/news/3522/hysterical-and-angry-clinton-shrieks-town-hall-robert-kraychik\">hysterical</a>\u201d and \u201cshrill\u201d in a news article about her speech in a town hall. Compare this to media descriptions of Donald Trump. When Trump raises his voice during speeches, he is not described as crazy but rather as \u201c<a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2015/11/18/donald-trump-delivers-classic-donald-trump-speech-worcester/bahIDhrfz5aojO4cG69YII/story.html\">forceful</a>.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The word \u201chysterical\u201d oppresses women today just as, in the past, it invalidated their emotions and vilified their sexual desires as symptoms of a mental disorder. Nowadays, if a woman expresses an emotion or opinion that is deemed excessive or inappropriate, she is immediately slammed with the label \u201ccrazy.\u201d Your girlfriend is upset at you for not texting her back for three days? She\u2019s acting crazy.</span></p> <p><span>But what about the man who punches a hole in the wall? Is he crazy? No, he\u2019s just under a lot of stress, okay, he had a hard day at work. The poor guy.</span></p> <p><span>Why don\u2019t we make the same excuses for women? When a woman has an emotional outburst, we don\u2019t try to put ourselves in her shoes and understand why she\u2019s so upset. We call her crazy. We tell her that her opinion doesn\u2019t matter and her emotions are groundless, and we silence her. Why is that?</span></p> <p><span>The <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/real-men-dont-write-blogs/201406/why-we-dont-give-each-other-break\">fundamental attribution error</a> is the tendency for people to explain their own behavior as a product of their situation, and to explain someone else\u2019s behavior as a product of their personality. Therefore, since our society looks through the eyes of men, we are more likely to justify a man\u2019s behavior with his situation, but more likely to explain a woman\u2019s behavior by chalking it up to her personality. As a result, we as a society are more unforgiving toward women and don\u2019t give them the same excuses that we give to men.</span></p> <p><span>This tendency to label women as crazy inhibits the progress women can make in society. So long as women are called crazy, they cannot be taken seriously in any sphere of their lives. In the workplace, when women display assertive behavior\u2014as Megyn Kelly did in her <a href=\"http://time.com/4198737/donald-trump-megyn-kelly-sexism/\">questioning</a> of Donald Trump\u2014they are belittled as overemotional or irrational. In the hospital, when women complain of pain\u2014as the wife of <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/10/emergency-room-wait-times-sexism/410515/\">this</a> writer did\u2014they aren\u2019t taken seriously and receive less aggressive treatment. And in their personal lives, when women display anger or grief, they are told to \u201c<a href=\"http://groupthink.kinja.com/dont-ever-tell-someone-to-calm-down-1683615772\">calm down</a>,\u201d suggesting that their complaints are somehow unjustified or excessive. Even scientific research shows <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26322952\">evidence</a> of this double standard: When a man expresses anger, this increases his power to influence his peers; but when a woman expresses anger, it makes everyone take her less seriously.</span></p> <p><span>The stereotype of the crazy woman contributes to sexism by dismissing women\u2019s emotions as irrational and questioning a woman\u2019s sanity every time she expresses an emotion. However, the stereotype also contributes to the stigma of mental illness.</span></p> <p><span>Mental illness is serious and prevalent, faced by approximately <a href=\"https://www.nami.org/Learn-More/Mental-Health-By-the-Numbers\">one in five</a> American adults. However, people with mental illness often <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brick-brick/201405/the-stigma-mental-illness-is-making-us-sicker\">experience</a> judgment, negative stereotyping, and stigma from society. Approximately <a href=\"http://www.mentalhealth.wa.gov.au/mental_illness_and_health/mh_stigma.aspx\">three out of four</a> people with mental illness report that they have experienced prejudice and discrimination. The harmful effects of the stigma are <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/why-we-worry/201308/mental-health-stigma\">significant</a>, including social exclusion and poorer quality of life.</span></p> <p><span>Mental illness should never be used as an insult. But every time we describe a woman as \u201ccrazy,\u201d we further stigmatize <a href=\"http://everydayfeminism.com/2014/09/mental-illness-vs-sexism/\">mental illness</a>. When we call women crazy, we use the word to suggest that their behavior is so inappropriate and shameful, it\u2019s as if they\u2019re mentally ill.</span></p> <p><span>Sexism and mental illness stigmatization may be separate phenomena, but in this case, they are not perpetuated separately. Both are prejudices deeply ingrained in our society, and both are extremely disempowering and harmful to the affected populations.</span></p> <p><span>Calling women crazy otherizes, dismisses, and shames them. But it also otherizes, dismisses, and shames people who actually live with mental illness. In this way, the stereotype of women as \u201ccrazy\u201d doesn\u2019t just prevent women from achieving equality and respect. It also stigmatizes the mentally ill and prevents them from achieving equality and respect as well.</span></p> <p><span><br></span></p> <p><span><em>Nian Hu \u201918, a Crimson editorial executive, is a government concentrator in Mather House.

{"title": "Harvard Files Amicus Brief Against Graduate Student Unionization | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Leah S. Yared", "body": "<p><span><strong>UPDATED: March 1, 2016, at 12:13 a.m.</strong></span></p> <p><span>Harvard jointly filed an amicus brief to the National Labor Relations Board on Monday arguing against the unionization of graduate students, joining six other Ivy League universities, Stanford, and MIT in a call for the board to uphold existing rulings that define the relationship between private universities and graduate students as strictly academic.<br></span></p> <p><span>In an email sent to faculty members, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Dean Xiao-Li Meng wrote, \u201cAlong with our peer institutions, we share the concern that introducing labor unions into this educational relationship would disrupt academic programs, administration of financial assistance, and infringe upon academic freedom.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Last April, a group of graduate students at Harvard <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/4/6/grad-students-unionization-movement/\">made public their unionization efforts</a>, and last week leaders of that group indicated that their movement <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/2/25/gsas-union-effort-reaches-threshold/\">had gained support from the majority</a> of graduate students who work across Harvard as teaching fellows or research assistants.</span></p> <p><span>In 2004, the NLRB ruled that graduate students at Brown University were not employees, meaning that federal union protections would not apply to them. Currently, two cases brought separately by graduate students at Columbia and The New School are under review by the NLRB and could stand to alter the relationship between private universities and their graduate students.</span></p> <p><span>The <a href=\"http://ogc.harvard.edu/files/ogc/files/amicus_brief_-_case_02-rc-143012_0.pdf?m=1456777061\">brief</a>, filed jointly by nine universities at the solicitation of the NLRB for the Columbia case, comes while graduate students across the nation\u2014including at Harvard\u2014push for their universities to recognize them as employees with the right to collectively bargain.</span></p> <p><span>The brief emphasizes the <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/10/16/GSAS-reaffirms-opposition-union/\">strong stance</a> Harvard has already taken against unionization, arguing that the formation of a graduate student union would fundamentally change the relationship between graduate students and universities to one based in labor, not in education, and that such a move could \u201ctransform the collaborative model of graduate education to one of conflict and tension.\u201d University President Drew G. Faust has <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/9/9/faust-disapproves-grad-unionization/\">made clear her opposition</a> to unionization on similar grounds.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cBoth collective bargaining and arbitration are, by their very nature, adversarial,\u201d the brief states.</span></p> <p><span>GSAS administrators sent students an email late Monday afternoon announcing the filing of the amicus brief and reiterating their stance against unionization. The Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Auto Workers posted on its Facebook page that members \u201care disappointed in the administration's continued interference with our democratic process and their refusal to recognize or respect the majority of graduate workers who have openly called for a union.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>For some students, the filing represents a shift in Harvard\u2019s strategy regarding the unionization effort. In October, GSAS administrators <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/10/16/GSAS-reaffirms-opposition-union/\">issued guidelines</a> on how to respond to the movement\u2014welcoming discussion but discouraging hostility.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cSo far, it feels like the administration has been running a pretty dainty, gentle anti-union campaign, and we expected it to get more aggressive and we couldn\u2019t predict the form that it would take exactly,\u201d Ph.D. student Abigail Weil, a member of the unionization effort, said.</span></p> <p><span>John T. Trumpbour, research director of the Labor and Worklife Program at Harvard Law School, said he thought the University\u2019s move was not surprising.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think that the private universities really feel that they are at a turning point, so a lot of them really want to do as much as they can to stop these victories now, and this they see as a very crucial decision,\u201d Trumpbour said. He added that if a Democrat is elected the next U.S. President in 2016 and the NLRB rules in favor of graduate students, it could be difficult for a future board to reverse that decision.</span></p> <p><span>Weil said she disagreed with the brief\u2019s claim that collective bargaining is inherently contentious.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to be adversarial or have any animosity towards our employers,\u201d Weil said. \u201cWe want to come to the table as equals.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Chamith Y. Fonseka, a Ph.D. student and a member of the unionization effort, wrote in an email that he is \u201cparticularly disappointed in the administration because - contrary to the University\u2019s claims - efforts like these are exactly what creates an adversarial relationship between the administration and student body.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Much of the brief focused on the threat a union could pose to academic freedom. The brief described a hypothetical situation in which a professor wants to change the format of a final exam from multiple-choice to an essay, and, as a result, a graduate student union files a formal grievance charging that the change could create extra work for teaching fellows.</span></p> <p><span>The brief also cites issues that have surfaced at New York University, the only private institution that has voluntarily recognized a graduate student union, such as grievances filed over the selection of teaching assistants.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cGiven the experience of NYU, it is a near certainty that the advent of bargaining with graduate assistants will irrevocably damage graduate education in the private sector, and potentially undergraduate education as well,\u201d the brief states.</span></p> <p><span>The brief also states that the process of filing grievances against faculty could have an \u201cenormous and psychologically destructive\u201d impact on graduate students and faculty.</span></p> <p><span>Trumpbour said he disagrees that unionization would be harmful to graduate education. As a Ph.D. student at Harvard in the \u201990s, he said representation could have made it easier to voice his opinions without being singled out.</span></p> <p><span>The brief added that the relationship between university and student cannot be separated into \u201cdistinct spheres\u201d of employee and student. But Weil said such a distinction is not necessary.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe don\u2019t feel that being an employee and being a student are mutually exclusive categories,\u201d Weil said.</span></p> <p><span>The brief\u2014which Weil called an \u201c11th hour decision\u201d\u2014was filed on the last day the NLRB allowed submissions from interested parties. Responses to the amicus brief must be filed by March 14.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Leah S.

Americans believe he\u2019s sincere, earnest\u2014that he\u2019s a different kind of politician. But this trust is misplaced. Sanders is not really a different kind of politician, his election will not give rise to a different kind of political system, and Americans should trust neither our politicians nor our politics. It\u2019s pleasant to indulge in the willful ignorance of Sanders\u2019 candidacy, but we must be honest. The hagiographic narrative of his campaign is false.<br></span></p> <p><span>Though he\u2019s advocated a number of populist policy positions, Sanders is not a different kind of politician with respect to justice for the oppressed. <a href=\"http://www.shakesville.com/search/label/Looking%20For%20Bernie\">Time and again</a>, he has <a href=\"http://www.sevendaysvt.com/vermont/clash-consciousness-have-progressives-lost-touch-with-their-blue-collar-constituents/Content?oid=2431519\">curried favor</a> with blue-collar white voters at the expense of other  groups.

Gun violence is a matter of racial justice, but he shored up support with rural voters by <a href=\"http://www.sevendaysvt.com/vermont/whos-afraid-of-the-nra-vermonts-congressmen-thats-who/Content?oid=2435066\">opposing</a> gun restrictions, including universal background checks. He <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/01/14/hillary-clintons-claim-that-sanders-voted-for-the-charleston-loophole/\">supported</a> the loophole that allowed Dylann Roof to purchase a pistol and kill nine people in the hate crime at Emanuel Church. And Sanders has lobbied for bald-faced environmental racism, <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/105/hr629\">co-sponsoring</a> legislation for a nuclear waste disposal site in Sierra Blanca, Texas. Poor, majority-Latino Sierra Blanca was selected as the dumping site for Vermont\u2019s radioactive waste <a href=\"http://social-ecology.org/wp/1998/10/the-texas-vermont-maine-nuclear-dump-bringing-environmental-racism-home/\">at least in part because</a> residents couldn\u2019t speak English and wouldn\u2019t understand environmental reports that were <a href=\"http://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/texans-defend-sierra-blanca-community-against-nuclear-waste-disposal-1996-1998\">never</a> translated into Spanish. Sanders\u2019 record might be better than former Secretary of State Hillary <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2016/01/31/the_clintons_sordid_race_game_no_one_will_say_it_but_the_clintons_rise_was_premised_on_repudiating_black_voters/?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=socialflow\">Rodham Clinton\u2019s</a>, but that\u2019s not a high enough bar\u2014especially since he comes from one of the most liberal states in the nation. When Sanders announced his presidential campaign in Burlington, <a href=\"http://www.sevendaysvt.com/vermont/color-blind-outside-vermont-can-sanders-talk-race-immigration/Content?oid=2699814\">few</a> of Vermont\u2019s black and Latino leaders attended.</span></p> <p><span>Above all, Sanders\u2019 candidacy is premised on a dangerous mistruth about American government. When he calls our political system merely broken, Sanders pretends as though it once worked and can be fixed. In fact, it has never been just. To trust any politician is to trust a political system that was founded on oppression and that is not built for the liberation Sanders promises. Ironically, as the putative independent and self-proclaimed outsider who <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-08-20/bernie-sanders-deal-with-the-democratic-devil\">cut a deal</a> with Democrats to win his seat in Congress\u2014and as both a white man\u2019s populist and the most progressive candidate for President of the United States\u2014Sanders is proof of this. Revolutions unfold outside and against power structures, not within them. In selling voters on a figurative revolution, Sanders dangerously <a href=\"http://www.blackagendareport.com/bernie-sanders-sheepdog-4-hillary\">legitimizes</a> the American political system.</span></p> <p><span>There is honor and value in the difficult work of chipping away at institutionalized oppression from the inside\u2014of minimizing violence, mitigating pain, and reducing harm in a way that is <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/01/obama-biggest-achievements-213487\">painstaking</a>, rarely <a href=\"http://www.comingoffaith.com/2015/12/21/news/politics/admin/obama-is-not-twant-him-to-be/\">inclusive</a>, and never systemic. If Sanders is willing to lead this kind of change, he must make that argument in those terms. Instead, he is running on a false promise <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2016/02/sanders-campaign-has-crossed-neverland\">and</a> <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/1/17/10784528/bernie-sanders-single-payer-health-care\">flimsy</a> <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/02/11/bernie_sanders_can_t_fulfill_the_debate_promise_he_just_made_on_mass_incarceration.html\">policy</a> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/16/us/politics/left-leaning-economists-question-cost-of-bernie-sanderss-plans.html\">proposals</a>, validating his candidacy with a purist image that isn\u2019t borne out by the facts. Just as electing a black president couldn\u2019t end racism, electing a candidate who isn\u2019t funded by super PACs won\u2019t end corporate control of American government.</span></p> <p><span>Though it\u2019s pleasant to indulge in false hope and willful ignorance, it\u2019s unethical to let this narrative about the United States go unchallenged. Our political system isn\u2019t broken and can\u2019t be fixed. It\u2019s oppressive by design. The only revolution that can end institutionalized oppression\u2014including class-based oppression\u2014is one that will never happen: a real one. We can make incremental, limited but meaningful change, but that\u2019s a hard sell and one Sanders seems unwilling to make. This is unfortunate, because the most radical thing he could do is acknowledge the hard truth that our political system can never be divorced from oppression.</span></p> <p><span>Sanders is not really a different kind of politician, this is not a different kind of political system, and Americans should neither trust our politicians nor our politics. Vote for him or don\u2019t vote for him, but don\u2019t trust Bernie Sanders.</span></p> <p><span><br></span></p> <p><span><em>Ted G.

{"title": "Harvard Krokodiloes Celebrate 70th Anniversary | Arts | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Melissa C. Rodman", "body": "<p><span>The Harvard Krokodiloes sang and shared favorite snippets of memories with the audience during their 70th anniversary concert in Sanders Theatre on Friday. Hundreds of Kroks alumni of all ages came from around the country to celebrate with festive banquets, reunions with friends, and renditions of old standards during the weekend-long event.</span></p> <p><span>Surveying the packed house, Peter S.S.Y. Wu \u201916, the group\u2019s general manager, and Tom M. Keefe \u201916, gave virtually no introduction to their set. Instead, their fellow current Kroks sauntered and jumped from the theatre\u2019s wings and aisles onto the stage, where they moved in time with the jazzy, snappy harmony of \u201cHouse of Blue Lights,\u201d a Kroks classic opening number. The singers ricocheted from stage right to stage left before settling into a loose arc. Scatting, smooth jazz, and some signature whoop-de-doops ensued, triggering smiles and cheers from the audience.</span></p> <p><span>Twenty minutes before, Kroks alumni, friends, and family had filed into Sanders and mingled among the rows of red leather benches. In the audience, Mark H. Rubenstein \u201990 and his Kroks peers launched into tales about their time in the group in the early 1990s, reminiscing about their annual trips to Bermuda and their undergraduate-years tuxedos, which they affectionately dubbed \u201cbattle tuxes\u201d because they sang and danced in them until the suits burst at their seams. \u201cI think they brought their original battle tuxes [this weekend],\u201d Rubenstein said, pointing assuredly to John D. Zedd \u201990 and Jonathan H. Ebel \u201992, sitting to his left. \u201cI have a new one,\u201d he added, as the lights dimmed and the show began.</span></p> <p><span>After the Kroks of 2016 finished their first set\u2014a scatty version of \u201cTake the A-Train\u201d and a rendition of \u201cI\u2019ve Got You Under My Skin\u201d that featured high-powered snapping\u2014the Kroks of the 1960s took to the stage. During \u201cStormy Weather\u201d and \u201cThe Emblem,\u201d standards from The Krok Songbook, the soloists, salt-and-pepper haired and often bespectacled, strutted to the mic, having ditched their tuxes, \u201cbattle\u201d or otherwise, for suits and ties. When they took their bows at the end of the set, Sanders gave them a standing ovation.</span></p> <p><span>Moving through the decades of the group, the Kroks of the 1970s put a political spin on \u201cLet\u2019s Do It,\u201d by doctoring the traditional lyrics to sound like insults traded during recent presidential candidate debates. \u201cThis next song is about sex,\u201d a 1970s Krok said to introduce the number. The musical jabs included, \u201cBen Carson might snooze through it,\u201d \u201cBill and Hillary may not do it,\u201d \u201cAnd Donald Trump, he invented it\u2014just ask him, they\u2019re huge,\u201d and \u201cBernie Sanders, we assume does it.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>When all the groups\u2014current, alumni, and honorary Kroks\u2014took to the stage for the traditional Scottish song \u201cLoch Lomond,\u201d their voices coalesced into one powerful strand. \u201cIt\u2019s just heartwarming because all the groups come together,\u201d Michael J.

The ticket, organized by Ron K. Unz \u201983 and headlined by five-time presidential candidate Ralph Nader, has drawn national media attention and criticism from <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/2/2/faust-condemns-overseers-outsider/\">Harvard\u2019s top administrators</a> for its two-pronged platform.</span></p> <p><span>Jeannie Park \u201983, a founder of the Coalition, said she learned of the \u201cFree Harvard, Fair Harvard\u201d campaign while its candidates were soliciting Asian American alumni groups for support in order to qualify for the Overseers ballot. Upon learning that most of the candidates had publicly argued against affirmative action, Park said she and her friends decided they \u201cneeded to do something to call attention to the larger agenda of the candidates, and, frankly, to stop them.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe were particularly disturbed by the idea that the slate was counting on Asian American alumni to give them the votes they needed,\u201d Park said. \"There is a long history of using Asian Americans to drive a wedge into affirmative action. We reject being part of any such strategy at Harvard.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The outsider ticket, which also counts physicist Stephen D. Hsu, writer Stuart S. Taylor, Jr., and attorney Lee C. Cheng \u201993 among its members, is calling for Harvard to release more detailed data about its undergraduate admissions processes, suspecting that the College\u2019s use of affirmative action could be used to discriminate against Asian American applicants.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe fact that these particular individuals are happy with the current system and who gets admitted does not mitigate the fact that the admissions process is potentially very unfair,\u201d Unz said, referring to the Coalition. \u201cHarvard proudly proclaims that it takes race into consideration and believes in diversity but it denies that there's any sort of an Asian quota. Harvard should be honest in what it\u2019s doing.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Kevin B. Jennings \u201985, president of the First Generation Harvard Alumni Board and a member of the Coalition, called the \u201cFree Harvard\u201d tenet of the candidates\u2019 platform a \u201cred herring,\u201d contending that making Harvard free would would unnecessarily subsidize tuition for wealthier students.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt's very easy to come up with phrases that are catchy and appealing, like \u2018Free Harvard, Fair Harvard,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThis strikes me more as a PR stunt than a genuine effort to understand how we can make Harvard a fairer place for people of all backgrounds.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Unz countered Jennings\u2019s criticism, pointing to Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders who is \u201cadvocating free tuition for everybody in America, including the grandchildren of Donald Trump.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cNobody's accusing him of being a tremendous supporter of the rich,\u201d Unz said.</span></p> <p><span>According to Park, the Coalition sent a questionnaire focused on issues of diversity to all 13 Overseers candidates\u2014counting both the outsider quintet and the eight nominated by the Harvard Alumni Association\u2014and plans to endorse five based on their responses and biographies by the end of March.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Daphne C.

Trump won three states in Tuesday\u2019s primaries, his presence as the subject of Currier House\u2019s Housing Day video was far less welcome.</span></p> <p><span>Early this week, Currier removed a Trump-themed <a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/lEWdwgMh\">Housing Day video</a> after several students criticized the video\u2019s caricature of the business mogul as offensive and unwelcoming to undergraduates. In the original video, Currier resident Joseph P. Hall \u201916 dons a blonde wig and pokes fun at Harvard\u2019s other upperclassman Houses in the style of Republican front-runner Trump. </span></p> <p><span>Shortly after Currier residents screened the video, some students criticized the short, calling Currier\u2019s affiliation with Trump\u2014a polarizing figure whose campaign has launched verbal attacks against women and minority groups\u2014offensive and alienating. Amid the controversy, Currier quickly removed the video, which Currier Faculty Deans and tutors had previously approved, according to House Committee member Katherine Barton \u201916.</span></p> <p><span>In the face of some student backlash, Currier Faculty Deans Richard W. Wrangham and Elizabeth A. Ross held what they said was an off the record town hall in Currier on Tuesday evening. Shortly following the meeting, many attendees stayed to film a second video that removed all references to Trump and featured a Bob Marley song with Currier-specific lyrics.</span></p> <p><span>Although Currier officially renounced its connections to the parody, many students criticized the removal of the video.</span></p> <p><span>Currier resident Aaron Grand \u201918 said he felt the decision to take down the video was misinformed.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe video clearly wasn't meant to be offensive,\u201d Grand said. \u201cIt was meant to lampoon the guy that concerned students hate, and to take it down and having this massive outcry is a bit extreme.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Some students argued that the removal of the video reflected a broader culture of political correctness.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhat is offensive about the video anyway, aside from the hairstyle? All that the immediate censorship does is show that we would rather maintain a stifling culture of correctness than have an honest discussion about issues,\u201d Pforzheimer resident Fred Lu \u201916 said.</span></p> <p><span>In a statement sent over Currier\u2019s House-wide email list, Wrangham and Ross wrote that they \u201cappreciate that people with differing life experiences have different viewpoints,\u201d adding that they were pleased to see lively debate over the video.</span></p> <p><span>Still, many Currier residents said the video was hurtful, and lauded the town hall for its high attendance and participation.</span></p> <p><span>Hall, the student who impersonated Trump, said that, although the video was made in good spirits, he is glad to see it replaced.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI was asked by the House to do my Donald Trump impression, which was a product of a Halloween costume I thought was very funny and entertaining,\u201d Hall said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI\u2019m very sorry about the effect this video had on people,\u201d Hall said. \u201cI\u2019m very happy Currier has found a new video to be the new Housing Day video, and I\u2019m still very happy about the video Katherine [Barton] and I made.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Yasmin Z. Sachee \u201918, one of Currier\u2019s Undergraduate Council representatives, said the video failed to properly account for the House\u2019s ideological diversity.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI personally wasn't offended by the video, but I definitely do see that the video wasn't so inclusive of all the political views on campus,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we make a video about a House, we should try to make a video that encompases all views.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf anyone felt uncomfortable or marginalized, it shouldn\u2019t be a video that is endorsing Currier House,\u201d Paul Stainier \u201918, another Currier resident, said.</span></p> <p><span>Wrangham, Ross, and Avik Chatterjee '02, a race relations tutor in Currier, declined to comment on the Trump-inspired video.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Jalin P.

{"title": "The Privileged Liberal | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>You\u2019ll oftentimes find Harvard\u2019s Privileged Liberal studying in a coffee shop (Starbucks, no less) sipping on a pricey macchiato. As they flip through the pages of their assigned readings, a notification pops up on their iPhone: Social Justice Club meets in 10 minutes<em>. </em>They get up and walk towards the door, their designer boots clicking loudly on the floor. As they exit the coffee shop they pass by a homeless man, slumped over on his side as he shivers in the New England cold; they pay no attention, wearing their brand new Canada Goose jacket (retailing at about <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Business/700-winter-jackets-worth-investment-ridicule/story?id=21611417\">$600</a> a pop)\u2014it provides only enough warmth for one. They arrive to their meeting just on time, and as they sit down and pop open their shiny Macbook Pro, they share Bernie Sanders\u2019s latest speech on Facebook as he attacks the \u201cbillionaire class.\"</span></p> <p><span>Harvard is undoubtedly a bastion for political activism. And while I admire this extreme contrast from the apolitical culture of my high school, it\u2019s been uncanny noticing how student opinion at Harvard often takes a leftward, anti-market approach on economic issues. I suppose this shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. President Nixon notably called Harvard the \u201c<a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2000/2/2/what-we-truly-believe-ppharvard-richard/\">Kremlin on the Charles</a>\u201d; between 2011 and 2014, 84 percent of campaign <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/5/1/faculty-political-contributions-data-analysis/\">donations</a> by Harvard faculty went to Democrats and all three of Harvard\u2019s most recent classes (<a href=\"http://features.thecrimson.com/2015/freshman-survey/lifestyle/\">2017</a>, <a href=\"http://features.thecrimson.com/2015/freshman-survey/lifestyle/\">2018</a>, <a href=\"http://features.thecrimson.com/2015/freshman-survey/lifestyle/\">2019</a>) overwhelmingly self-identified as \u201cliberal.\u201d Why is it, however, that the children of the nation\u2019s elite seem to have such disdain for the very system that, whether or not they\u2019d like to admit, grants them many of the luxuries they enjoy?</span></p> <p><span>This phenomenon isn\u2019t restricted solely to Harvard. In fact, some of the left\u2019s contemporary heroes have also been some of the free market\u2019s greatest beneficiaries. While the median income in America is about <a href=\"http://www.deptofnumbers.com/income/us/\">$53,000</a>, Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton and her husband, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/07/31/hillary-clinton-releases-8-years-of-tax-returns/\">earned</a> $139 million from 2007 to 2014\u2014all while proclaiming that \u201c<a href=\"http://observer.com/2015/07/taking-aim-at-republican-rivals-hillary-unveils-liberal-economic-vision/\">inequality</a> is a drag on our economy.\u201d These \u201cchampions\u201d for working families, like their Harvard counterparts, are comparable to <a href=\"http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/champagne-socialist\">champagne socialists</a>, to borrow the British term\u2014individuals who preach the virtues of egalitarianism while splurging in their own extravagances.</span></p> <p><span>Now, I\u2019m not declaring that all Democrats live affluently, nor that all leftists at Harvard come from wealthy families or are devotees of Marx and Engels. Wealthy politicians reside on both sides of the aisle, Republican and Democrat alike; having wealth certainly doesn\u2019t disqualify you from speaking out on important economic issues facing the nation. Anything but. However, what I am saying is that much of the rhetoric and <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/editorials/2015/09/10/the-democrats-stoke-class-warfare/fZodtsCeeZ5wMxHlBknDKJ/story.html\">class warfare</a> which the modern left utilizes seems to contradict the lifestyles its leaders lead, yet so harshly critique. And in that same light, as a student who comes from a family making less than the national median income, I find it particularly amusing when I see someone walking through the Yard in Burberry, or raving about their family\u2019s summer in Milan, later hash-tagging #FeelTheBern on Facebook as they attack the free market and claim to know what America\u2019s middle class really needs.</span></p> <p><span>It is natural, as Harvard students, to believe that all problems are solvable if provided with the right approach; this leads us to think that with the right government program or regulation, America\u2019s economic woes\u2014income inequality, poverty, etc.\u2014can be fixed. But America\u2019s economic troubles cannot be solved like a math equation, nor can they fit into a bureaucratic one-size-fits-all hypothesis. Poverty in America, for example (one of many), has remained <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/05/business/50-years-later-war-on-poverty-is-a-mixed-bag.html\">vastly persistent</a>, even after $20 trillion spent by the government since President Johnson enacted his War on Poverty in 1964. In fact, as of 2014, four in 10 African American children and three in 10 Hispanic children live in poverty; and, as of mid-2011, it was estimated that 1.7 million American households were living on cash <a href=\"http://npc.umich.edu/publications/working_papers/?publication_id=255&amp;\">incomes</a> of less than $2 per day.</span></p> <p><span>For the sons and daughters of those who\u2019ve benefitted most from the free market, it\u2019s easy for them to talk about the evils of money\u2014the evils of capitalism\u2014because they\u2019ve never had to  face the reality of being part of the working class. A new tax to them means a couple less dollars to spend on the next vacation; another government regulation means a few workers their parents are forced to lay off. They are utterly removed from the consequences of an overbearing regulatory state, and the <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/economic-intelligence/2013/03/11/raising-the-minimum-wage-wont-help-the-poor\">catastrophic</a> effects it has on the poorest and most vulnerable of our society.</span></p> <p><span>So the next time you find yourself speaking with an affluent liberal as they rail against capitalism, remind them of a phrase the left loves to use against their opponents: check your privilege. Maybe, just maybe, they will.</span></p> <p><span><em><br></em></span></p> <p><span><em>Ian T. Mullane '19, a Crimson editorial comper, lives in Canaday Hall.</em></span></p>"}

Only minutes after giving a two-hour talk, D\u00edaz simultaneously signs piles of books for fans and chats with FM.</em><br></span></p> <p><span><br></span></p> <p><span>FM: You always say you\u2019re a voracious reader, so what\u2019s currently sitting on your nightstand?</span></p> <p><span>JD: My goddaughter, who lives in Japan\u2014her photograph.</span></p> <p><span>FM: Well, what are you reading now?</span></p> <p><span>JD: I am reading all the finalists for the Pulitzer Prize. I\u2019m on the board, so it\u2019s confidential, but it\u2019s an enormous amount of reading.</span></p> <p><span>FM: With regards to writings, what have you been working on over the past two weeks?</span></p> <p><span>JD: What I\u2019ve been working on is the introduction to \u201cBest American Short Stories,\u201d and I\u2019ve been working on a kids\u2019 story for [my goddaughter]. My goddaughter, the same one on my nightstand, asked me for a story for her, so I have to write her one.</span></p> <p><span>FM: Who is someone you really admire in academia right now?</span></p> <p><span>JD: Oh my God, in academia?... I admire Arlene Davila. She\u2019s an anthropologist over at NYU. I admire her tremendously. I admire another colleague of mine, someone who of course is absolutely brilliant, the scholar Satya Mohanty. He made a huge impact on me as an intellectual. And another scholar, her name is Paula Moya, she\u2019s over at Stanford. She\u2019s both a friend and someone whose work has been hugely influential on me.</span></p> <p><span>FM: Who else outside of academia?</span></p> <p><span>JD: Oh! The journalist \u00d3scar Mart\u00ednez, who wrote \"La Bestia.\" That was a really, really important book. That book fucking blew me the fuck away\u2014it was extraordinary.</span></p> <p><span>FM: Changing topics a little bit: During the dialogue that was just hosted, you talked about the Black Lives Matter movement. Why now? Why is this something that has come up over the last year and not 10 years ago?</span></p> <p><span>JD: Well, it\u2019s always an interesting game trying to figure out and reverse-engineer why a movement came up, and you could always come up with a thousand different combinations of causes, but probably those same arguments and conditions could have been met elsewhere and nothing happened. I think history is a very spooky, spooky thing.</span></p> <p><span>FM: What about our current context has made these types of movements so prevalent at this very moment?</span></p> <p><span>JD: Certainly there\u2019s no accident that we have a plurality of young people who have leveraged social media and leveraged a critical set of skills around race and culture and hegemony and a common vocabulary to great effect. And it\u2019s just important that we have a generation of young people who are growing up with this model, whatever its shortcomings may be. Young people actively trying to transform their society\u2014there\u2019s going to be a lot more of that. Just in terms of demographics alone and how many more young people there are, being a young person under these neoliberal conditions is a very fraught affair. No wonder these kids and young people are trying to kick ass because this system is a burden to them, and I\u2019m not surprised that some of them are trying to transform it. You can draw these same connections from Black Lives Matter to Arab Spring to all sorts of youth movements across the world. Young people have grown in numbers, and they\u2019re growing in confidence, and they\u2019re facing a society that has been organized to lock them out, and they want to change that.</span></p> <p><span>FM: Given the current context of the elections and Donald Trump\u2014a candidate pretty widely recognized to be conservative on these issues\u2014winning states like Massachusetts, do you think that now is a good time? Would these discussions have been better placed a few years ago?</span></p> <p><span>JD: So rare are eruptions of activism that have at [their hearts] justice that I am just so glad to have it\u2014I never wished to have it earlier or later. I think these things arrive just in time. I tend to be more pragmatic; I\u2019m like, \u201cWe\u2019re just lucky to have them.\u201d It is earthshaking for us to have a movement like this at any moment. It\u2019s very inspirational to me to see what has occured and what is happening, both as an activist and as someone who is just interested in the future.</span></p> <p><span>FM: Why do you think so many of these conversations have really taken root on university campuses?</span></p> <p><span>JD: I think because we have a critical mass of smart, young people with the spaces and the technological means to have these conversations. Look, for a lot of young people, universities are places where they simultaneously come to understand themselves and understand the conditions of the world in which they inhabit.... It\u2019s not a surprise that at that intersection of self-knowledge and world-knowledge and youth you begin to see these kinds of energetic conversations and movements.</span></p> <p><span>FM: One of the problems that many groups on campuses face when organizing is that institutional memory is so short. What can people do to try and combat that?</span></p> <p><span>JD: One of the things is to understand that the nature of this beast is that it reboots every few years and that there have to be ways for this generation to think about archiving some of its experiences\u2014whether each group comes with its own strategies\u2014thinking about having Houses with a designated historian. For example, why doesn\u2019t the history and the counter-history of each of these Harvard Houses get handed to each student? That would, at least for me, be an interesting way to keep historical memory alive.</span></p> <p><span>FM: What do you make of the change to the House master title?</span></p> <p><span>JD: Harvard is very Talmudic in its self-preoccupations; it\u2019s not surprising that it has excited a lot of activity. If they had conferred with any of us decades ago, we probably could have told them that it was probably time to change the title. I think these universities like to cover their innocence when in fact the real question is why were we not asked 50, 70, 90 years ago. How is it that an institution that has benefited so clearly from chattel slavery is unaware of some of the larger resonances that some of these \u201cinnocent terms\u201d might have on the children of the very enslaved Africans who enriched these spaces?</span></p> <p><span>FM: What do you think about Harvard\u2019s decision to not offer Latinx studies here?</span></p> <p><span>JD: These schools determine, in a large part through their institutional power, what is worthy of study, and it is nothing short of criminal that at this day and age Harvard not only does not have Latinx studies, but that there\u2019s still a conversation being bandied around. It also shows you how hegemony works. I mean, those of us who are attempting to understand how <em>latinidad</em> works in this world, those of us who embody <em>latinidad</em>, those of us who are imbricated in <em>latinidad\u2014</em>we have to put ideas of ourselves together by the seat of our pants. We don\u2019t have institutional power that opens up spaces of deliberation that allows us to become and understand. It\u2019s hard for a community to come to understand itself.<br></span></p> <p><span>FM: You say this is critical to understand ourselves. How does this affect other communities?</span></p> <p><span>JD: It takes these white kids kindergarten, elementary school, middle school, high school, college, television, politicians, their doctors, their physical neighborhoods\u2026. Everything is an academy that teaches them about themselves, and when we come to a place like Harvard, where riches are endless, the largest \u201ccommunity of color\u201d cannot have a small space where it may begin to access itself. It\u2019s extraordinary.</span></p> <p><span>FM: How does your experience working in English and Spanish differ? During your talk, you mentioned that Spanish language has a more fluid nature, and you can take some words and spin them in new ways.</span></p> <p><span>JD: I would say that characterologically, I\u2019m different in the two languages. I\u2019m very well defended in English. In English, it\u2019s like I\u2019m a Death Star, and I would say that I\u2019m far more sincere in Spanish. My friends always say, \u201cWow, you are such a nice and relaxed person in Spanish.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>FM: What\u2019s up your sleeve for the next year?</span></p> <p><span>JD: I\u2019ll just keep trying to work. My work takes forever. I\u2019m the slowest writer I know, so I\u2019ll just keep trying to work. I\u2019ll spend another five years trying to write a single chapter, I guess. We\u2019ll see what happens.</span></p>"}
{"title": "The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Now that Housing Day videos have been released, and the best day of the entire semester is upon us, Flyby writers Sruthi and Brandon have set to the difficult task of ranking all of them (instead of, you know, studying for midterms).<br></span></p> <p><span>1. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URGEP5YFoIY\"><strong>Dunster: The House Awakens</strong></a></span></p> <p><span><strong>Sruthi</strong>: Even though Dunster and Pfoho had essentially the same video this year, Dunster won out in the end. The video editing skills for this video were out of this galaxy (pun intended). That first shot with Dunster House in the middle of the desert was gold.</span></p> <p><span><strong>Brandon</strong>: Yeah, Star Wars seemed to be the go-to theme this year, but Dunster killed it with the video quality. I was halfway convinced that the Housing Video was coming out of LucasFilms studio. The moose at the end was the icing on the cake.</span></p> <p><span>2. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-NtdRXpZTo\"><strong>Pfoho: The Pforz Awakens</strong></a></span></p> <p><span><strong>Sruthi</strong>: To be honest, picking between Dunster and Pfoho was the hardest decision. Pfoho\u2019s great play on \u201cThe Pforz Awakens\u201d was genius.</span></p> <p><span><strong>Brandon</strong>: I agree! Will Greenlaw\u2019s cameo as Finn in the Pfoho video almost made me do a spit take the first time I watched the video.</span></p> <p><span>3. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuhKi96Zgc\"><strong>Mather: Mather Be</strong></a></span></p> <p><span><strong>Brandon</strong>: As a former member of an a capella group, I have to give Mather mad props for pulling off an a capella rendition of \u201cRather Be.\u201d Plus, they went all out in the end with a full, high-school musical like dance routine.</span></p> <p><span><strong>Sruthi</strong>: Yeah, Mather definitely gets extra points for taking the time to arrange the song. I think using Rather Be was a great idea, and the lyrics throughout the song were great because they actually changed them to talk about the house.</span></p> <p><span>4. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjLmyN5Q1Xg\"><strong>Winthrop: All I Do Is Winthrop</strong></a></span></p> <p><span>Sruthi: Winthrop\u2019s dancers are killin\u2019 it, but the video could definitely have been way shorter. 7 minutes is a long time to dedicate to my procrastination. Props for using a song that fit the House name in though: All I do is Win(throp).</span></p> <p><span>Brandon: I mean, you figure we all have the attention spans of ants by this point in the semester, so going with a super long video wasn\u2019t the best idea. Their mascot was the redeeming quality\u2014I could watch that lion dance all day long.</span></p> <p><span>5. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um-oUUX4PGo\"><strong>Leverett House: Housing Dreamz</strong></a></span></p> <p><span><strong>Sruthi</strong>: The dream sequence was clever and took Leverett beyond the standard \u201cmusic video\u201d Housing Day video. Also, it was great to see a bunch of Leverett people get involved. The music video just seemed like a lot of fun to film. I\u2019m not one to listen to Fetty Wap very often, but even I could tell this was well executed.</span></p> <p><span><strong>Brandon</strong>: Shout out to Flyby Writer Kamara for making it rain in the dining hall! But seriously, any house that went the Fetty Wap route automatically wins in my eyes. Plus, the vocals were good. Definitely better than some of the Fetty Wap emulators you hear at parties. Yaaaaaaaas.</span></p> <p><span>6. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYHDHalvMg0\"><strong>Lowell House: Lowell Better Have My Letter</strong></a></span></p> <p><span><strong>Sruthi</strong>: Drone footage gives Lowell lots of points. I feel like a lot of the same footage was used though so it got a little repetitive for sure.</span></p> <p><span><strong>Brandon</strong>: Tea-time in Lowell House never looked so lit before. It\u2019s a shame that we\u2019ll only get a year of Lowell Tea if we\u2019re sorted into the house. The only reason we didn\u2019t rank them higher is because of how misleading the clip about Lowell Steins was; that looked more like <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/3/2/final-club-yale-model/\">a party at Yale</a> than one at Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>7.<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nY-Ms-a0D0M\"><strong>Eliot House: Is It Too Late To Get Eliot House?</strong></a></span></p> <p><span><strong>Sruthi</strong>: I was really impressed by the attempt to recreate the dancing from the actual video. The Flyby compers last semester made a music video recreating this same song, and so I recognize the difficulties that come with attempting those dance moves. That being said, it was a pretty average Housing Day video, and that\u2019s why it ended up in the middle of the pack.</span></p> <p><span><strong>Brandon</strong>: Sruthi, we can actually never talk about that video again. My dancing was so bad\u2026 Considering that, you are totally right: you have to give the upperclassmen of Eliot House props for matching the pretty sick moves of the \u201cSorry\u201d dancers. Speaking from experience, it is very hard to move your body like that, and I\u2019m sorry we ever tried.</span></p> <p><span>8. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0l788n9iCQ\"><strong>Kirkland: An American Musical</strong> </a></span></p> <p><span><strong>Brandon</strong>: Nice save, Kirkland. The original Kirkland video was unsettling\u2026 Not Quincy Man-Penguin unsettling, but nerve-racking. As if I wasn\u2019t stressed out enough with midterms\u2014I definitely did not need a bunch of upperclassmen yelling at me. They got points for trying, though. But going for a Hamilton-spin when every other video went for pop songs? That was definitely one of the best decisions they could\u2019ve made. It definitely bumped Kirkland up from the bottom of the list. I\u2019ve been humming that tune all afternoon.</span></p> <p><span><strong>Sruthi</strong>: I\u2019m going to admit, I haven\u2019t seen Hamilton yet, but I really want to. After Kirkland\u2019s rendition, that desire has definitely gone up. I agree with Brandon that not going for the classic pop song gets them points in by book.</span></p> <p><span>9. <strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBITUW7YnbQ\">Adams: Remix to Tradition</a></strong></span></p> <p><span><strong>Sruthi</strong>: As a freshman, I feel like this video didn\u2019t have anything that grabbed my attention out of the several other videos I\u2019ve been watching the last few days. I would like to point out that the little kids in Adams\u2019 video are <em>positively adorable</em>. The few seconds they were in the video were great.</span></p> <p><span><strong>Brandon</strong>: Were they twerking? I severely hope they weren\u2019t twerking\u2026  But I don\u2019t know, I just wasn\u2019t feeling the Adams housing video, and this is coming from someone who has prayed to the Housing Gods for Adams house.</span></p> <p><span>10. <a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UJP59FL1Clk\"><strong>Cabot: Hello</strong></a></span></p> <p><span><strong>Brandon</strong>: I was waiting for someone to do a rendition of \u201cHello,\u201d and Cabot finally came through. I LOLed when the main singer went off on that tangent about how far away the Quad is. I totally feel her\u2014the Quad isn\u2019t <em>that </em>far away. Plus, any video with a Rakesh cameo is cool in my eyes.</span></p> <p><span><strong>Sruthi</strong>: Okay so the star of Cabot\u2019s video is Dean Khurana which is clearly a winning point. The issue with this one was it was a little static just because the song is so slow, but it was still a great way to show off the house.</span></p> <p><span>11. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzOHjcQF6hk\"><strong>Quincy DJ Qhaled</strong></a></span></p> <p><span><strong>Sruthi</strong>: Yeah, I\u2019m not sure if the Snapchat video route was supposed to be a new hipster technique for creating a housing video, but it didn\u2019t work. For one thing, I couldn\u2019t really hear what was happening in the videos, and I\u2019m not sure I actually got to see anything clearly because of the quality.</span></p> <p><span><strong>Brandon</strong>: I agree, the Snapchat video was not the best choice. I was actually heartbroken to find out that this was Quincy\u2019s official Housing Day video instead of their <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hSkDCI-uo0\">\u201cMan-Penguin\u201d</a> episode. Seriously, it might have been one of the weirdest things I\u2019ve ever seen here at Harvard (and that\u2019s saying something), but at the end of it I wanted to see more.

{"title": "Cambridge Votes for Kasich Over Trump | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Hannah Natanson", "body": "<p><span>Businessman Donald J. Trump may have won the Republican primary in Massachusetts last Tuesday, but in Cambridge, Ohio governor John R. Kasich was the winner.</span></p> <p><span>In Cambridge, Kasich earned 34 percent of the Republican vote as Trump trailed him with 25.2 percent, according to data compiled and published online by the Boston Globe. That result stands in stark contrast to the final statewide tally, in which Trump came away with a commanding 49.3 percent of the 631,395 Republican votes cast. Kasich finished a distant second in Massachusetts with just 18 percent. </span></p> <p><span>Massachusetts\u2019 Democratic primary was much closer, with former Secretary of State Hillary R. Clinton earning 50.1 percent of 1,204,927 Democratic votes cast, barely edging out Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who garnered 48.7 percent.</span></p> <p><span>Clinton had a slightly larger lead in Cambridge, where she received 53.3 percent of the vote, seven percent more than Sanders.</span></p> <p><span>Some Harvard students spent the days leading up to the primary, held on the same day as 11 other state contests as part of \u201cSuper Tuesday,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/2/26/students-campaign-super-tuesday/\">working to get out the vote</a> for their favored candidates.</span></p> <p><span>James Pindell, a political reporter for The Boston Globe, said voting results in Cambridge are not indicative of broader statewide trends, and that the close finish between Sanders and Clinton reflected the immense effort both candidates expended trying to target Massachusetts\u2019 white, working-class neighborhoods.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMassachusetts has this reputation of white liberal elite, but Massachusetts politically is not so much Cambridge and metro west areas that tend to be more liberal elite,\u201d Pindell said. \u201c[Massachusetts is] much more driven by blue-collar white working class\u2026 in terms of those voters, Bernie and Hillary were directly competing.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Pindell said Massachusetts would have been the \u201cbiggest prize\u201d of the five states Sanders\u2019 campaign hoped to carry on Super Tuesday, and added that the candidate\u2019s failure to do so bodes extremely poorly for his future.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMassachusetts was pretty much [Sanders\u2019] last stand; he had to win here,\u201d Pindell said. \u201cHe has the money to stay in, and clearly his supporters want him to stay in, but, after losing Massachusetts, it\u2019s hard to see how he will win the nomination.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Despite losing Massachusetts on Super Tuesday, Sanders did pull out wins in four other states. Harvard professors, however, said the results of the multiple primaries held that day likely <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/3/3/professors-assess-super-tuesday/\">solidified Clinton\u2019s standing</a> as the Democratic Party\u2019s likely nominee.</span></p> <p><span>According to Politico, Clinton now has 63 state delegates from Massachusetts, ahead of Sanders\u2019 46.</span></p> <p><span>On the GOP side, Pindell said he was not surprised by Trump\u2019s outsized victory and Kasich\u2019s second-place finish. Pindell credited Trump with \u201cputting in the time here,\u201d noting that the business mogul held four events in the state over the past year, including his recent rally at University of Massachusetts Lowell in January.</span></p> <p><span>Kasich narrowly beat Florida Senator Marco A. Rubio, who ended close behind him with 17.9 percent of the vote, and Texas Senator Ted Cruz, who came in fourth with just 9.6 percent. Trump now has 22 delegates from Massachusetts, while Kasich and Rubio each picked up eight apiece.</span></p> <p><span>Though Rubio has gained national attention as a potential \u201cestablishment\u201d candidate who could make strides against Trump, Pindell described Kasich\u2019s victory over Rubio in Massachusetts as \u201cjust another example where Rubio struggled\u201d on Super Tuesday.</span></p> <p><span>Still, Massachusetts is a state that could \u201ceasily align with Rubio,\u201d Pindell said, suggesting that Rubio\u2019s failure to gain more of the Republican vote was likely due to the candidate\u2019s lack of presence in the state.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Hannah Natanson can be reached at <a href=\"mailto:mailto:hannah.natanson@thecrimson.com\">hannah.natanson@thecrimson.com</a>.

{"title": "Trumped Up | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Like a floundering wedding toast, Donald Trump\u2019s presidential candidacy was deeply funny before it became deeply troubling. Much effort has been expended of late in understanding Trumpism\u2014both what it means and what it portends. Truth being much stranger and crueler than fiction, the politicos have less substance to offer nowadays than the comedians and the satirists. It\u2019s a bit like being forced to live through a comedic sketch, like a Futurama gag that went on many months too long.</span></p> <p><span>Thinking about Trump in dystopic terms, as I tend to do, leads me to seek sanctuary in literature. A little before Huey Long\u2019s political ambitions were cut short by a bullet, Sinclair Lewis penned his great political satire \u201cIt Can\u2019t Happen Here.\u201d Of course, the impossible does happen\u2014the authoritarian Buzz Windrip wins the presidential election and marches America steadily along the road to totalitarianism. Perhaps also instructive in the matter is Phillip Roth\u2019s more recent \u201cThe Plot Against America,\u201d in which the fascist Charles Lindbergh rides a wave of anti-Semitic, populist support to the White House.</span></p> <p><span>Much like these fictional despots, Trump is said to be a populist, yet everyone\u2014aside from his supporters\u2014seems to hate that he leads the Republican primary field. The Republican Party is scrambling to avoid further embarrassment, while the depleted stock of candidates speaks conspiratorially of brokered conventions.</span></p> <p><span>Sun Tzu argued that to defeat your enemies, you must first know them. And so we must. First, the man: equal parts brash, brogue, and braggart. Then, the platform, as inaccurate an appellation as that may be: It is vapidity incarnated, where vague appeals to the superlative (constructions like \u201cgreatest,\u201d \u201cbest,\u201d and \u201call time\u201d) masquerade as policy substance. It is also, fundamentally, an expression of majoritarian victimhood, an elaborate whine made amidst all this talk of greatness, lost or reclaimed. Instead of political incorrectness, as his advocates prefer to christen it, Trump seeks to parcel the blame for white disaffectedness on any scapegoat in sight: Muslims, Mexicans, Chinese, and anyone else.</span></p> <p><span>The man\u2019s a chameleon, a charlatan, a vindictive vulgarian. He says nothing, is bound to nothing\u2014he is the least factual, substantive, and civil candidate that I\u2019ve seen. And yet he is the likely Republican nominee, and perhaps, with the timely implosion of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, the next president.</span></p> <p><span>How, oh how, could this happen?</span></p> <p><span>This blame game is widely played: Trump is, after all, the hair-do that launched a thousand think pieces. Maybe it was Mitt Romney\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/mitt-romney-misses-his-best-shot-at-donald-trump\">fault</a> for seeking Trump\u2019s endorsement in the last election? Or <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/opinion/sunday/from-obama-to-trump.html?_r=0\">perhaps</a> \u201cObama-era trends in liberal politics?\u201d Or is it the untapped reservoir of \u201c<a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/3/1/11127424/trump-authoritarianism\">authoritarian</a>\u201d Americans, a modish new theory put out by one political scientist? (I\u2019m skeptical that the assessment of \u201cauthoritarianism\u201d\u2014based on questions about child-rearing strategies\u2014used in these studies actually captures something meaningful about voters.) One thing is for sure though: He\u2019s not just a <a href=\"http://cookpolitical.com/story/8754\">summer fling</a>, as some within the commentariat had claimed.</span></p> <p><span>I have another theory, one that is radical only because it gets no mention among polite society.</span></p> <p><span>It\u2019s the Republicans, stupid.</span></p> <p><span>I happen to be of the opinion that the horridness of a political party\u2019s elected standard-bearer actually says something about that party\u2014even if their elites are of a different mind. That something has stunk about the Republican Party has been no secret to anyone, even the party\u2019s leaders. They even commissioned an <a href=\"http://goproject.gop.com/rnc_growth_opportunity_book_2013.pdf\">autopsy</a> that predicted much of these misfortunes not long after they so splendidly squandered their presidential chances in 2012.</span></p> <p><span>In the past, whenever someone pointed to the xenophobes, barely concealed racists, and conspiracy theorists congealing at the base of the Republican Party, they were labeled impolite and disrespectful. Bipartisanship has long been lionized, but its core assumption is that both parties have reasonable ideas that emerge from respectful differences of opinion.</span></p> <p><span>Without a dramatic reconstitution of the Republican Party, by which I mean the disavowal and expulsion of the crazies, that idea can no longer hold. I pity the reasonable Republicans\u2014and they do exist\u2014who must publicly show their faces amid this debacle. Let\u2019s hope we can make them respectable again.</span></p> <p><span><br></span></p> <p><span><em>Idrees M.

{"title": "AROUND THE ECAC: Men's Hockey, Vesey Aim to Make Postseason History | Sports | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Michael D. Ledecky", "body": "<p><span>What a difference a goal makes.<br></span></p> <p><span>A year ago, Jimmy Vesey lifted a deflected puck over the right pad of Yale goaltender Alex Lyon in New Haven. The double-overtime strike clinched the ECAC quarterfinal series for the Harvard men\u2019s hockey team and set up the Crimson\u2019s conference title in Lake Placid the very next week.</span></p> <p><span>In a Players\u2019 Tribune article last week, Vesey identified the quarterfinal victory as the tipping point in his decision to forgo a pro deal with the Nashville Predators and return to Cambridge for his senior season. The column, an emotional ode to Harvard and college hockey, conveniently coincided with the NHL trade deadline, in which Nashville General Manager David Poile avoided any major acquisitions to preserve an open roster spot for his team\u2019s prized draft pick.</span></p> <p><span>Vesey\u2019s admission might have prompted some particularly passionate (or neurotic) Predators fans to ponder an alternate reality\u2014one in which Vesey never scored that goal. One in which Vesey signed with Nashville last March, slid into the Predators\u2019 top-six forward rotation in April, bridged the difference in those overtime losses to Chicago, and boosted Nashville to a Stanley Cup championship in June.</span></p> <p><span>While the Music City can only dream, the goal\u2019s impact on Vesey\u2019s present team is clear. As Harvard prepares to host Rensselaer in Game 1 of the 2016 edition of the ECAC Hockey quarterfinals later today, Vesey and company are no longer frustrated underachievers. They\u2019re defending champions.</span></p> <p><span>The role change comes with new expectations and opportunities. A series win this weekend would all but assure Harvard a spot in the NCAA regionals, earning the program its first tournament berths in consecutive years since 2006. Meanwhile, a sweep of the next two weekends would place this Crimson squad among Harvard\u2019s best. In the 53-year history of the ECAC tournament, Harvard has yet to win back-to-back postseason titles.</span></p> <p><span>For Vesey in particular, the next two weekends offer an opportunity to cement a special legacy.</span></p> <p><span>Last year, the Charlestown native scored an ECAC tournament-record nine goals over seven games in perhaps the most dominant individual performance of the entire NCAA postseason. This year, Vesey again finds himself in the national player of the year conversation after a consistent regular season punctuated by flashes of brilliance, but the co-captain has yet to string together a stretch of play that quite matches his effort from last March.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard men\u2019s hockey has churned out a long line of all-time great alumni. If I had to rank them, I\u2019d place the national players of the year and Olympic gold medalists\u2014Lane MacDonald \u201989, the Fusco Brothers and the Cleary Brothers\u2014firmly in a top tier of greatness. Joe Cavanagh \u201971, C.J. Young \u201990, Dominic Moore \u201903, and Alex Killorn \u201912 are among other stars of yesteryear who could factor into a first- or second-tier conversation.</span></p> <p><span>Vesey already ranks among the greats. He currently sits tied for fifth with Dan DeMichele \u201971 on the Crimson\u2019s all-time goal list at 77 scores, seven behind Young and 34 behind MacDonald. It\u2019s just a question of what tier. Another title would go a long way, but that will require besting a deep ECAC headed by the nation\u2019s No. 1 team.</span></p> <p><span>The final measure of Harvard\u2019s season\u2014and Vesey\u2019s collegiate career\u2014will be taken sometime over the next four weekends. A single goal might make all the difference.</span></p> <p><span>Let\u2019s take a look at this weekend\u2019s quarterfinal match-ups:</span></p> <p><span>CORNELL AT QUINNIPIAC</span></p> <p><span>In a clash between old-hockey snobs and new-hockey snobs, Cornell will need to double Quinnipiac\u2019s season loss total to get out of Hamden alive. Meanwhile the nation\u2019s top-ranked Bobcats are still in search of their first ECAC postseason win after collecting their third regular season title in four years.</span></p> <p><span>Last year, Quinnipiac sniper Sam Anas missed the conference final four after a lower-body injury in the previous round. Harvard took advantage in Lake Placid, opening up an early three-goal lead and not letting go despite a Bobcat surge in the second period.</span></p> <p><span>Expect Anas to have better luck this time. The Bobcats arguably wound up with the toughest draw this weekend, but their speed and finesse should be too much for the hard-hitting Big Red.</span></p> <p><span>Pick: Quinnipiac in two.</span></p> <p><span>DARTMOUTH AT YALE</span></p> <p><span>Remember when Harvard beat Dartmouth 7-0 in Hanover on Halloween? You probably don\u2019t because you were out doing the Monster Mash in your \u201csexy Donald Trump\u201d costume.</span></p> <p><span>Since then, the inconceivable has become conceivable. Trump is on track to clinch the nomination, and Dartmouth has a shot at the NCAA tournament.</span></p> <p><span>But just as Trump can\u2019t risk a brokered convention, Dartmouth can\u2019t count on an at-large bid. This Big Green team has shown resilience, but its season ends in New Haven.</span></p> <p><span>Pick: Yale in three.</span></p> <p><span>CLARKSON AT ST. LAWRENCE</span></p> <p><span>The Clarskon Golden Knights will bus 10 miles down U.S. route 11 today to write another chapter in the greatest hockey rivalry that 300 people care about.</span></p> <p><span>In all seriousness, this series is going to be a big deal in North Country, but consider this: if every resident of Canton and Potsdam, N.Y. showed up for a game at TD Garden, there would still be about 1,000 empty seats left.</span></p> <p><span>Instead, the Saints and Golden Knights will meet today at St. Lawrence\u2019s Appleton Arena, the greatest fire hazard in the ECAC. According to Clarkson\u2019s Office of Student Life, Clarkson-SLU games usually follow university-organized \u201cSpirit Days,\u201d which often involve large bonfires. Thankfully, the university feeds the flames miles away from the wood-paneled, 65-year-old home of its cross-highway rival.</span></p> <p><span>While all four of the weekend\u2019s series could go either way, this one\u2019s the most unpredictable. Clarkson needed three overtime periods over two games to dispatch of last-place Princeton last weekend, but the wins speak to the Golden Knights\u2019 grit. Clarkson does not have one star who can take over a game like St. Lawrence has with sophomore goaltender Kyle Hayton, but the Pride of Potsdam enter this weekend with the momentum on its side.</span></p> <p><span>Pick: Clarkson in three.</span></p> <p><span>RENSSELAER AT HARVARD</span></p> <p><span>Over his last two contests against the Crimson, RPI goaltender Jason Kasdorf has stopped 92 of 93 shots, handing Harvard a 0-0 tie and 2-1 loss in the process. In the latter game, the hosting Crimson outshot the Engineers, 50-22, forcing Kasdorf to make a career-high 49 saves. Harvard\u2019s sole win against RPI this season, a 4-0 victory in the final of the Shillelagh Tournament in South Bend, came with Engineer freshman Cam Hackett in net.</span></p> <p><span>While it might be easy to anoint Kasdorf as the Crimson Killer heading into this weekend, there\u2019s something that feels fluky about these teams\u2019 last two meetings. The scoreless tie came just a week after the Shillelagh. Meanwhile, the shot chart from Harvard\u2019s losing effort suggests that game was less about Kasdorf\u2019s brilliance than it was about a sputtering Crimson offense\u2019s struggle to get grade-A opportunities in the slot.</span></p> <p><span>In that respect, I have to give RPI\u2019s defensive unit some credit for forcing Harvard to the outside, but as I\u2019m sure Coach Donato would, I expect the hosts to find an extra \u201ccompete-level\u201d around the net this weekend. The postseason always comes with an extra side-order of scrappiness. With that, the Engineers\u2019 demonstrated puck-possession problems should come back to bite them.</span></p> <p><span>Pick: Harvard in two.</span></p> <p><span>Staff writer Michael D.

{"title": "American Nightmare | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Our last day in London was cold and wet. Still, I didn\u2019t want to leave.</span></p> <p><span>It\u2019s not just the tea there (much better), or the number of streets and landmarks referenced in T.S. Eliot poems (much higher). It\u2019s not the way things don\u2019t go wrong in the United Kingdom but instead \u201cgo pear-shaped\u201d\u2014and, when they go just right, \u201cBob\u2019s your uncle!\u201d It\u2019s not even the hats.</span></p> <p><span>Though England\u2019s charming conventions, tasty treats, and huge amount of history endear its capital to me, they\u2019re not enough. In fact, the real reason my spring break trip made me more serious than ever about hopping across on a semi-permanent basis has less to do with where I\u2019d be going to than where I\u2019d be coming from: As much as I\u2019m an Anglophile, I\u2019m worried I\u2019m also starting to become an Ameriphobe.</span></p> <p><span>Don\u2019t get me wrong. I love the United States, from the national anthem to baseball to listening to the national anthem before watching baseball\u2014which, embarrassingly enough, always gets me teary-eyed. Cricket and \u201cGod Save the Queen\u201d could never do it for me. And forget monarchies; our system of democracy fascinates me so much I used to carry a copy of the Constitution in my pocket.</span></p> <p><span>Washington, D.C. looks nothing like Maine, which looks nothing like Nevada, which looks nothing like the Californian coast. The people across the country are as varied as the landscape, not only in the nation\u2019s biggest cities. That\u2019s a sign of something else: Being American, to most people, often means being a whole mix of things, and it never means looking just one way. For all the United States\u2019 problems\u2014and there are lots of problems\u2014the inclusive concept at the country\u2019s core holds up.</span></p> <p><span>But when Donald Trump promises to \u201cmake America great again,\u201d he\u2019s tearing down the very things that make America great already. Under the guise of countering political over-correctness, he\u2019s not only throwing civility out the window but also channeling a kind of bigotry the U.S. hasn\u2019t seen in the political mainstream for generations. The melting pot, in Trump\u2019s America, would turn into a boiling pot, and the very people the nation was built to welcome would get poached.</span></p> <p><span>The Constitution isn\u2019t safe, either. Trump\u2019s not alone in stomping all over it: The Republican Senate has vowed not to confirm any nominee President Obama puts forth for the Supreme Court vacancy\u2014not even the centrist he\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/president-obama-to-nominate-merrick-garland-to-the-supreme-court-sources-say/2016/03/16/3bc90bc8-eb7c-11e5-a6f3-21ccdbc5f74e_story.html\">chosen</a> for the nod.</span></p> <p><span>Even if Trump doesn\u2019t win the Republican nomination, much less the general election, droves of Trumpeters have made their way to the ballot box over the past few months. The xenophobic, authoritarian culture Trump has produced and promoted is potent, and it\u2019s terrifying. Up against this America, a life of buttered scones and crumpets looks particularly rosy.</span></p> <p><span>And this is coming from someone who, compared to some, doesn\u2019t have a lot to lose under a Trumpian regime: Trump is no feminist, but most of the time, the hate he spews isn\u2019t directed at me. I doubt I\u2019m the only one itching to escape, and I suspect many of the others have stronger grounds to fear what\u2019s happening at home.</span></p> <p><span>Maybe I\u2019m being cowardly. Maybe running away from America\u2019s problems is just as bad as running away from my own. In the end, some combination of inertia, obligation, and that stubborn love of baseball will probably keep me in town. But for soon-to-be graduates and other 20-somethings who do decide to get away, the years before they\u2019ve really settled down should be an easier time than any to pack up. It\u2019s not so unreasonable a choice for young Americans who, in a country that day by day looks less and less like America, are starting to mind the gap.</span></p> <p><span><br></span></p> <p><span><em>Molly L.

He described it as \u201cthe hardest issue [he] has worked on in the government.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Johnson has been public in his stance against barring all refugees into the United States, instead insisting the United States concentrate on \u201cbuilding bridges\u201d with Muslims around the country.</span></p> <p><span>He noted that the only time he became involved in the current presidential campaign was when Republican frontrunner Donald J. Trump insisted on banning all Muslims from entering the United States.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cNot only is it wrong, it is contrary to our Homeland Security interests,\u201d he said of Trump\u2019s plan.</span></p> <p><span>Dominique A. Gilbert, a student at the Kennedy School, said she favored Johnson\u2019s stance.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI like that it is proactive. It\u2019s the best long-term approach,\u201d she said.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview prior to the talk, Johnson also lambasted the plan put forth by several Republican candidates to deport all undocumented persons.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s not wise, and it\u2019s not possible\u2026 more than half of that population has been here for more than ten years,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have become integrated members of the country, many of them have children, they live and work among us.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Johnson also spoke about the Department's counterterrorism efforts in what he characterized as a \u201cnew phase of the global terrorism threat\u201d with an increased risk of domestic terrorism.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe\u2019re on defense a lot,\u201d Johnson said, denying that the Department of Homeland Security only reacts to past terrorist attacks. \u201cWhat I preach to our folks is that we have to respond to the next terrorist attack, not the last one.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Johnson emphasized that much of the work that Homeland Security does is behind the scenes, which may contribute to the public\u2019s perception of the Department.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe public doesn\u2019t hear about all the extraordinary things that go toward keeping the homeland safe,\u201d he said. \u201cI think if more people knew about what our people do on behalf of the American public, on behalf of the taxpayer, you would be extraordinarily proud and impressed.\u201d</span></p>"}
{"title": "Thank God for Donald Trump | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Yep, I said it. As I wrote in a previous article, I have believed for a while now that Donald Trump stands a very good chance of becoming the next President of the United States. As difficult as it is to believe on this campus, and college campuses nationwide, a critical mass of the rest of the national population simply does not see the world the way that we do. In our formative years of development, we saw a black man win the national presidential election under the slogan, \u201cYes We Can,\u201d and we assumed that these words were the dawn of an entirely new era of American society. Out with the old, in with the new. New technology, new race relations, new marriage laws, new everything. New is better, new is the future.</span></p> <p><span>And while as we\u2019ve gotten older our generation has adapted to every new development, other folks, especially in economically disconnected areas, just don\u2019t see things this way. In fact, their lives are hurting. They like the way the world used to be. As a result, our nation is faced with a populist, anti-establishment backlash, led by a man who shows fascist tendencies in the things that he says and the way that he says them. There is a very real chance that Trump will win. And, believe it or not, I am grateful for this.</span></p> <p><span>Now, if you\u2019ve read my other articles, this statement might surprise you. Frankly, I\u2019m terrified of Trump, and believe that he is one of the greatest threats to American society that we\u2019ve seen in generations. I believe in Obama\u2019s America, at least what it promises in terms of race relations, and I believe that it is our duty as young leaders to fight for equality of opportunity regardless of race, gender, class of birth, or sexual affiliation. So, then, why do I thank God for Donald J. Trump?</span></p> <p><span>Because I believe that Donald Trump is exactly what our generation (especially white liberals) needs to wake up from our state of complacency. By representing intolerance, bigotry and racism, Donald Trump and his immense success show us that all of the progress generations of activists have fought for can be swiped away in an instant if our generation does not stand up and fight back. Unless our generation stands up, speaks out, and, crucially, votes, then we can get ready to inaugurate the 45th president of the United States: Donald J. Trump. And he is only the beginning.</span></p> <p><span>Now, as I\u2019ve detailed more extensively in <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/1/27/trump-american-fascism/\">a previous piece</a>, Donald Trump has said and done a lot of awful, terrible things, but he has also done some positive ones.  First and foremost, he has exposed the slimy underbelly of the Republican Party, which has been playing with fire for far too long, employing political tactics to keep the poor and uneducated in their place (including within their own party) while the rich prosper. Well, in 2016, the political chimera that is the Republican Party will finally split apart based on class lines, and we have Donald Trump to thank for that.</span></p> <p><span>We also have Donald Trump to thank for another, harder truth, especially at this university: While globalization and the information age revolution sound wonderful in theory, in practice they can have enormously disruptive effects on society. The jobs that we outsource, which build upon corporate profits, are American peoples\u2019 livelihoods. These social effects of globalization render a democratic system such as ours susceptible to populist backlash from economically disaffected groups, the \u201ceconomic losers.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>This is a particularly important lesson at a school like Harvard, where the elite are formed. As future world leaders, it is important to think about the consequences of our actions besides our own personal gain. It is dangerous to blindly ride the wave of technological innovation and progress if it means that we as the future elite neglect the needs and demands of society as a whole. It\u2019s time for us to realize that in a system defined by increased income disparity, there are going to be more losers than winners. If we, the elite, continue to think only of reaping the gains of technological progress without thinking of the rest of society\u2019s material wellbeing, we will leave our nation particularly vulnerable to demagogues such as Donald Trump in the future. And yet, Trump\u2019s dangerous appeal to the disenchanted economic \u201closers\u201d is exactly the threat we need to motivate us to work together to build a better society.</span></p> <p><span>Hopefully it\u2019s not too late, but if we are too complacent and fail to stand up to and vote against Trump, then our American society will take an enormous step backwards. Still, I believe in our generation, and progressives in all generations, and I believe that we will stand up to Trump\u2019s appeals to fear and tribalism and ensure that he does not take office. And ultimately, I am hopeful the threat posed by Trump and people like him will make our generation, and our school, recognize the danger posed by blindly pursuing technological progress at the expense of the livelihood of the American people. And, for these reasons, I thank God for Donald J. Trump.</span></p> <p><span><br></span></p> <p><span><em>William F.

{"title": "Law Prof. Laurence Tribe Comments on Ted Cruz's Candidacy | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Claire E. Parker", "body": "<p><span>As the 2016 election season ramps up, Harvard Law professor Laurence H. Tribe \u201962 finds himself at the center of a political firestorm.</span></p> <p><span>Over the past month, Republican presidential hopeful and Law School graduate Ted Cruz denounced his former constitutional law professor Tribe as \u201ca left-wing judicial activist\u201d while speaking in a mid-January Republican debate, while rival candidate Donald J. Trump has tweeted and debated in support of Tribe.</span></p> <p><span>The focus on Tribe stemmed from a widely-cited <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2016/01/11/through-ted-cruz-constitutional-looking-glass/zvKE6qpF31q2RsvPO9nGoK/story.html\">op-ed</a> he penned in The Boston Globe earlier this month titled \u201cUnder Ted Cruz\u2019s own logic, he\u2019s ineligible for the White House.\u201d In the article, Tribe calls into question Cruz\u2019s consistency in interpreting the Constitution. </span></p> <p><span>Cruz\u2014a known \u201coriginalist\u201d who interprets the Constitution based on the intent of its framers\u2014was born in Canada to an American mother and a Cuban father. Tribe wrote that originalists would argue the Constitution\u2019s framers likely intended  \u201cnatural born\u201d\u2014a constitutional prerequisite for becoming U.S. president\u2014to mean physically born in the United States. By these standards, he continued, Cruz should be ineligible to hold the nation\u2019s highest office.</span></p> <p><span>The op-ed brought Tribe national attention as Cruz and Trump briefly sparred during a televised Republican debate, arguing about Tribe\u2019s position and motivations for writing the op-ed. Before the debate, Cruz\u2019s campaign published a memo attacking Tribe, Cruz\u2019s former professor.</span></p> <p><span>Tribe insists that his motivations were not political; despite airing his liberal views openly, Tribe has not endorsed a candidate. Furthermore, he maintains that according to his own \u201cliving constitutionalist\u201d method of interpretation\u2014a more flexible reading of the Constitution\u2014Cruz should be able to run for the presidency.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cLarry Tribe is presumably on the whole a liberal, but he\u2019s just sort of throwing a little gasoline on a fire that\u2019s basically going on among Republicans,\u201d said Government professor Theda R. Skocpol, who studies American politics.</span></p> <p><span>Tribe is accustomed to fielding calls from politicians, lawyers, and journalists seeking his take on national controversies involving constitutional interpretation. In 2008, Tribe defended the eligibility of then-presidential candidate John McCain, who was born in the Panama Canal Zone to two American parents. This election season, Tribe said he had begun receiving calls about Cruz\u2019s eligibility to run, but he was initially reluctant to interfere with the aspirations of a former student.</span></p> <p><span>Still, Tribe said he decided to comment after he felt that Cruz\u2019s defense of his presidential right was hypocritical.</span></p> <p><span>Tribe said he is not particularly invested in the question of natural born citizenship. Rather, Tribe said, his main interest is in \u201cthe Constitution and my sense of how dangerous it is when people play fast and loose with it in order to further their political positions.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Cruz, who has consistently touted originalist positions throughout his career in law and politics, continues to maintain that he is eligible to be president.</span></p> <p><span>In a prepared statement, the Cruz campaign also maintained that Cruz is eligible to be president, regardless of his birthplace, because his mother was a citizen at the time of his birth.</span></p> <p><span>Trump seized on Tribe\u2019s arguments during the Republican debate to denounce his closest competitor.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cStranger things have happened,\u201d Tribe said on becoming part of Trump\u2019s political artillery.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Claire E.

{"title": "Changing How We Think About Change | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Last week, a friend asked me if I\u2019m registered as a Democrat or a Republican, and my gut reaction was to respond with \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>For the record, I do know: I am a registered Democrat. And, were I given the chance to register anew today, I wouldn\u2019t change my affiliation.</span></p> <p><span>Yet the question seriously tripped me up. I babbled about how I\u2019m proud to be socially liberal, but sometimes lean conservative, and I even assured him that I\u2019m partial to Republicans because my grandfather is one, and I love him.</span></p> <p><span>I\u2019ve been thinking about why I danced around giving my opinion ever since. Why I preferred to ramble like an idiot instead of just stating the truth. And as I\u2019ve been thinking about that one instance, I\u2019ve realized that I often avoid voicing my opinions. Maybe even more often than not.</span></p> <p><span>Which is weird, because I write for The Crimson\u2019s Editorial Board. My job is to have opinions and to express them. And what\u2019s more, I respect people with opinions. Opinions about fashion. Opinions about Kanye. Opinions about campus news or the presidential race. Well-researched, unapologetic, clear opinions.</span></p> <p><span>You\u2019d think I\u2019d want to share my own.</span></p> <p><span>The thing is, I\u2019m afraid of what will happen if I do but then decide I\u2019m wrong. With the Internet tracking my every move and thought, I feel as if I\u2019m accountable for everything I\u2019ve ever said. I feel like I\u2019m going to be accused of betrayal or ideological inconsistency if, for whatever reason, I decide to change my mind.</span></p> <p><span>More than ever before, we\u2019re able to publicly and globally project our political and social values to whomever cares to read about them. We\u2019ve created social environments where it\u2019s easy to exchange opinions with people who see the world differently than we do. But instead of creating a platform for eye-opening conversation and maximum exposure, we\u2019re fossilizing our opinions\u2014tracking and setting them in stone. Instead of being free to explore ideologies as we please and adopt new ones as we see fit\u2014God forbid!\u2014we\u2019re expected to remain steadfast in our beliefs for the sake of continuity.</span></p> <p><span>So I wonder, at what point, on which topics, and in which scenarios is it okay to take a stance, listen to the opposing rebuttal, and then realize I\u2019m wrong?</span></p> <p><span>These days, I\u2019m not sure I ever can. And that\u2019s a problem.</span></p> <p><span>Consider Hillary Clinton, who may be enduring more criticism than any other modern American for changing her mind. Pundits fairly point out that she\u2019s revised her <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/hil-nixes-same-sex-marriage-article-1.864728\">initial</a> opinion on gay marriage and has now come out in <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/06/hillary-clintons-gay-marriage-problem/372717/\">favor</a> of it. Likewise, she has <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/hillary-clinton-says-she-does-not-support-trans-pacific-partnership/\">criticized</a> the Trans-Pacific Partnership despite <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/secretary/20092013clinton/rm/2012/07/194673.htm\">initially</a> <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/hillary-clinton-says-she-does-not-support-trans-pacific-partnership/\">promoting</a> it three years ago. At best, she\u2019s accused of <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/10/democratic-debate-hillary-clinton-flip-flop-213247\">triangulating</a>; in the past several months, she\u2019s been called an \u201c<a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/12/hillary-clinton-flip-flops-from-2008-positions-in-/?page=all\">inauthentic</a>\u201d <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/17/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-change-position-same-sex-marriage/\">flip-flopper</a> who alters her stance on policy issues at the <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/10/democratic-debate-hillary-clinton-flip-flop-213247\">whim</a> of \u201cpolls and political pressure.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Apparently, Clinton\u2019s earlier support of the nascent Trans-Pacific Partnership precludes her from criticizing the deal today. Her previous statements against gay marriage have doomed her to eternal homophobic status. Somehow, it is unimaginable that Hillary Clinton, in the intervening years since she spoke out against gay marriage\u2014or the TPP, or <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/10/04/1427635/-Hillary-Clinton-s-2008-position-on-gun-control-wasn-t-what-it-is-now\">gun control</a>, or <a href=\"http://theweek.com/articles/556421/hillary-clinton-already-crushed-republicans-immigration\">immigration</a>\u2014may have realized that she was being insensitive or unsympathetic or simply wrong. And while it might be speculative to propose that this is why she\u2019s changed her stance, it\u2019s no more so than to argue that she\u2019s doing it simply to win votes.</span></p> <p><span>If Clinton is worthy of criticism, it\u2019s not because she has switched her opinions, but rather because she is not willing to openly admit that she\u2019s previously been wrong. I don\u2019t blame her: That\u2019s a scary thing to do.</span></p> <p><span>I wish we\u2019d do it more. I wish we\u2019d humble ourselves when we realize we\u2019re misinformed, or our alliances have shifted, or we\u2019ve simply changed our values. I wish we\u2019d give others the benefit of the doubt when they do the same.</span></p> <p><span>Far be it from me to argue in favor of political party-hopping and its equivalent in other fields. Just as you can\u2019t decide to like the Yankees when they\u2019re playing well and the Red Sox on the rare occasion that they\u2019re playing better, you don\u2019t get to be feminist or liberal or conservative or anti-racism or pro-abortion or Team-Aniston-over-Jolie only when it\u2019s convenient. You don\u2019t get to momentarily espouse an ideology because it is temporarily easy.</span></p> <p><span>I put a lot of pressure on myself to have opinions that are strong and controversial, opinions that will give rise to op-eds that I can publish in The Crimson. Opinions that will divide the student body in half, with a fiery contingent behind me and an even fierier one against me.</span></p> <p><span>But I think we all\u2014me, my peers, my grandparents, and maybe you\u2014often forget that it\u2019s possible to stand by our beliefs and also honestly explore other ideas and try them on for size. We forget that our opponents are smart too, that listening to them is not blasphemy. We forget that considering a thought is not the same as espousing it.</span></p> <p><span>And worst of all, we\u2019ve forgotten that sometimes it\u2019s healthy to change our minds.</span></p> <p><span><em><br></em></span></p> <p><span><em>Lily K.

So this was a topic that had fallen between my two areas of interest, and I thought that this would be an opportunity to try to bring them together.</span></p> <p><span>I didn\u2019t know when I decided to write the book whether Hillary Clinton was going to run or not\u2026 I figured that probably there would be a woman candidate this time, but it might not be Hillary.</span></p> <p><span>FM: A lot has been said about the role of gender in criticisms of Clinton and other female politicians. How did gender affect the campaigns of the women in your book? How is it influencing Clinton\u2019s campaign?</span></p> <p><span>EF: All of them had to deal with the prevailing ideas about gender from their different historical moments. Victoria Woodhull [the first female presidential candidate, who ran in 1872] faced very traditional ideas\u2026 which she violated in almost every respect. She was divorced, she was very radical, she was a free love advocate\u2026. She was depicted as \u2018lacking virtue\u2019\u2026 and that led to one of the great celebrated sex scandals of the late 19th century.</span></p> <p><span>Shirley Chisholm [the first African American major-party candidate of any gender, who ran in 1972] had a very devoted husband. She would be outraged when people would say to her, \u201cYour husband must be a wimp. How can he be married to a woman running for President or Congresswoman?\u201d She would say, \u201cNo, he\u2019s very manly. You don\u2019t know what he\u2019s like.\u201d But in fact he did devote himself to promoting her political career, and they did have a very traditional marriage in that respect.</span></p> <p><span>None of these women could escape the gender stereotypes of their time, but all of them challenged them through their run for the presidency. At the same time, they had to demonstrate that they were upstanding, respectable women, even though they were doing something completely nontraditional that violated prevailing gender norms.</span></p> <p><span>FM: You\u2019ve talked about the enormous influence of Betty Friedan\u2019s 1963 book, \u201cThe Feminine Mystique.\u201d How did second-wave feminism influence the possibility of a female president? Did the women of your book think of themselves as feminists?</span></p> <p><span>EF: I\u2019ve had people say to me, \u201cHow can you consider these people feminists?\u201d It was before the feminist movement. But yes, they were, all three.</span></p> <p><span>Margaret Chase Smith [a woman who ran for the Republican nomination in 1964] denied that she was a feminist\u2026 She supported efforts to progress women\u2019s equality\u2026 [and] she did a lot for women in her Congressional career. She was very interested in women\u2019s issues. But [she was] uncomfortable with the label \u2018feminist.\u2019 She didn\u2019t like the association. She didn\u2019t want people to think she was like Gloria Steinem. She was a dignified Republican with pearls.</span></p> <p><span>FM: Has third-wave feminism made it into federal politics? How has the role of feminism in politics changed since the eras covered in your book?</span></p> <p><span>EF: The landscape for women has completely changed since the early \u201960s\u2026. The number of women in national politics is still miniscule compared to the number of men, but political parties were very much changed by the challenges that feminists, civil rights activists, and radicals made at the end of the \u201960s and the early \u201970s.</span></p> <p><span>There are pieces in place in the foundation for someone like Hillary Clinton to build on. And no one has put the pieces together better than she has: the money, the patronage, the backing from party elites, the exposure to the public, the admiration.</span></p> <p><span>But\u2014if her husband hadn\u2019t been President, if the country hadn\u2019t come to know her as First Lady, if we hadn\u2019t been through two terms of scandal and recovery, if she hadn\u2019t become admired for standing by her philandering husband\u2026. Her stock soared after he was impeached, because she stayed with him. A lot of feminists thought it was terrible, that she wasn\u2019t a real feminist because she stayed with him\u2026 but the average person out there greatly admired her for it.</span></p> <p><span>She blends these traditional and feminist components. She might have been in national public office, but she wouldn\u2019t have gotten 18 million votes for president, if she didn\u2019t have\u2026 all those other bits that she put together. That\u2019s my view, anyway, and I\u2019m sticking to it.</span></p>"}

D\u00edaz Rosillo\u2019s class on American presidential elections, Government 1359: \u201cThe Road to the White House.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The course, which is offered every four years to coincide with presidential elections, has seen <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/2/1/ec-10-top-spring-course/\">record enrollment</a> this semester. With more than 514 students enrolled as of Thursday night, the Road to the White House is the second largest course at the College this semester.</span></p> <p><span>Gov 1359 is not your typical government course. While the class has a syllabus, its curriculum closely follows the events of each presidential election, which now in 2016 is  heating up as the field narrows. As a result, no two iterations of the course are exactly alike.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt was really cool because we studied what a primary is, what a caucus is, exactly a week after the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucus, and exactly a day before the first-in-the-nation New Hampshire primary,\u201d D\u00edaz Rosillo, a Government lecturer and resident dean of Dunster House, said.</span></p> <p><span>But the course does not merely cover the ins and outs of the campaign news cycle; rather, it is a rigorous application of scientific theory to the reality of the current election, D\u00edaz Rosillo said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe class is not a political class; it\u2019s a political science class,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we try to do in class is study cutting edge political science theory on campaigns and elections, and then we use the current campaigns as a lab in which students can explore whether the theories they\u2019re learning in class actually apply to real life campaigns.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Recently, students studied the different models by which political scientists predict election outcomes, along with the advantages and shortcomings of each of the systems. Students saw the limitations of how polling played out in Iowa, where early projections did not accurately predict results.</span></p> <p><span>The course\u2019s emphasis on data analysis stems in part from D\u00edaz Rosillo\u2019s background as a civil engineer. Trained at Tufts University, D\u00edaz Rosillo says he sees political science as a kind of engineering, in which one can use data to explain political trends.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI like to understand processes and how things work, and why they work the way they do,\u201d D\u00edaz Rosillo said. \u201cEven though the two fields, engineering and social science, seem so different, they\u2019re really not because they\u2019re both about using data to analyze things; they\u2019re about using data to make decisions.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Decision-making quickly became the focus of D\u00edaz Rosillo\u2019s work when he chose to study public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School. In addition to teaching the Road to the White House, D\u00edaz Rosillo also researches and teaches about executive power at all levels of government. Government 94fg: \u201cPresidents, Governors, and Mayors: Chief Executive Power in Comparative Perspective\u201d was offered in the fall.</span></p> <p><span>D\u00edaz Rosillo\u2019s current research emphasizes the use of data to inform presidential campaigns at the local and precinct levels, a project he hopes will soon yield positive results and \u201chelp somebody run a better and more effective campaign.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In the meantime, students en masse are enrolling in the Road to the White House, although the course counts only as an elective, even for Government concentrators.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI\u2019m pretty confident that people are taking the class not because they can check off a box but because they\u2019re really interested in the material,\u201d D\u00edaz Rosillo said.</span></p> <p><span>Miranda L. Ryshawy \u201918, who described herself as someone who generally does not follow elections closely, said that a desire to understand this year\u2019s election on a more scientific level, along with encouragement from her roommate, prompted her interest in the class.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis is the first election I\u2019m going to be able to vote in,\u201d she said. \u201cI think I will definitely look back on it as my baptism into being an active citizen.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Edgar A. Carrero \u201919 has also enjoyed the course.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s interesting to analyze a bit deeper than what you read about online,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>As the election season progresses, students will continue to apply their skills of analysis in real time. Applying his own analytical skills, D\u00edaz Rosillo offered predictions for the Republican and Democratic nominees. Based on current data, he said he was confident the Democratic nomination would go to former Secretary of State Hillary R. Clinton. The Republican nominee, however, is not as clear cut.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think based on the data and based on what we know right now, I\u2019d say it\u2019s going to be Donald Trump or Marco Rubio,\u201d D\u00edaz Rosillo said.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Fantasizing Flint | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Sixty-two minutes. That\u2019s how long it takes to get to Flint from my affluently ordinary suburb. <br></span></p> <p><span>Flint is far away, a place no one from my town would drive to or through willingly. I\u2019ve never even been there, the same way many of my metro-Detroit friends have never been to Detroit. The only story I have is my high school English teacher\u2019s distressed retelling of how she got lost in its empty streets, late at night, crying to her Dad through the phone. The story focused on her. The wasting city, crimes, angels, and graffiti were only a backdrop. They would remain that way.</span></p> <p><span>So when Flint appeared in little blue letters on Facebook\u2019s \u201ctrending\u201d section, my cursor sprinted over to see what was wrong. For something to have successfully bubbled out of Flint\u2019s deep pit of problems meant disaster. But... <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/18/us/flint-michigan-water-crisis-five-things/\">water</a>? My Great Lakes State had messed up water? The situation was so awfully absurd, I almost laughed about lead poisoning.</span></p> <p><span>I suppose it isn\u2019t surprising that my first reaction was inhuman. I had been trained to draw chasms of disregard for the \u201cproblem areas\u201d to be \u201cstay away\u201ded from all my life. Stories of murder, joblessness, gang violence, homelessness, and robbery were perfectly acceptable\u2014as long as they came from the Eight Mile side. But water. This was something basic enough for us suburbians to actually care about. Maybe.</span></p> <p><span>In the following weeks, it was strange, almost uncomfortable to witness a rupture of national concern over this 22-month old \u201cFlint thing.\u201d Nonprofits, Icelandic Water, Walmart, Hillary Clinton, senators, Cher, Eminem, Beyonce, and even Canada <a href=\"http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/a-look-at-mass-donations-to-flint-amid-drinking-water-crisis/ar-BBoJGMp\">stepped in</a>, lending their resources, energy, money, and publicity to bandage the cracks of what felt eerily like my area\u2019s crisis. Despite how obviously criminal the situation was and my own clear relationship, I couldn\u2019t process concern into my concept of Flint, the place normalcy tells me and my family to ignore. When I mentioned the situation to my dad over the phone, he gave a simple \u201cYes, it\u2019s very awful over there,\u201d and moved on. My mom didn\u2019t even know.</span></p> <p><span>But we are not unique. Abstraction is an expensive game that many suburban Detroiters have long played to prevent moral guilt from upsetting our unequal coexistences. Governor Richard D. Snyder, the overseer undoubtedly <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/michigan-governor-rick-snyder-apologies-for-flint-water-crisis/\">responsible</a> for this prioritization of financial plans over basic safety, is simply one of us. The complaints from <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/01/21/michigan-rick-snyder-flint-water-apology/\">as early</a> as May 2014 didn\u2019t register because Flint\u2019s existence didn\u2019t register. Even the Environmental Protection Agency failed to comprehend the consequences of the high lead levels it found, letting us take our time with making amends while the poisonous water remained.</span></p> <p><span>Come the next morning, I am once again eating my Annenberg breakfast empty-minded. Three weeks have passed since the media spike, and Flint is already in the far, dark corner of my mind. I smile when my friend sits down and tell her about how I had just lost my tenth water bottle (typical morning conversations). She lights up: \u201cCome buy a water bottle from my club next week! We\u2019re selling them to raise money for Flint, because water bottles, you know, water\u2019s important.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>What? Flint? A long moment of logical silence ensued. Finally, the continued depravity of the situation registers, but it takes far too long, giving time for guilt\u2019s cold hands to latch on. How? How is everyone everywhere so fixated on Flint\u2019s lead-filled water when we\u2014the people surrounding it\u2014continue to make choices for Flint\u2019s damnation? I have no trouble visualizing police brutality or Syrian refugees or lack of clean water in South Asia. Why then, am I unable to imagine a crisis that should be close and dear to me? What does this say about who I am? What does this mean for the suburbanites who don\u2019t care?</span></p> <p><span>I\u2019ll buy one of the water bottles. But when I do, I don\u2019t know if it will be in the name of Michigan or Harvard. When Flint is 11 hours away, I am far enough away to see the atrocity. I become irresponsible enough to want to correct their (our) mistake. And I will help because it is obvious that Flint\u2019s neighbors won\u2019t. I wish I could say this ability to heal, rally, fundraise, and care is something my neighbors uniquely lack. Yet it isn\u2019t. Even here, on this liberal campus, we are comfortable with letting neighborhoods like Dorchester or Roxbury <a href=\"http://www.neighborhoodscout.com/ma/boston/crime/\">suffer</a> high levels of poverty and crime. They are our Flint. They are our normal, our unfixable. And like any superior neighbor, we try \"our best\" before covering the complicated depths with shadows and cloaks.</span></p> <p><span>The truth is, we have crises not because they are unavoidable, but because when we are too close and too influential, we are also too tired and entangled. We don\u2019t want to recognize all the ways we are responsible. We see no point in devoting our busy lives to news so old and cold. In the micro, we see the nuances that make things impossible. So we ignore, and don\u2019t let ourselves know just how wrong we are.</span></p> <p><span><br></span></p> <p><span><em>Elizabeth Y.

{"title": "Clinton on the Trail | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Suddenly and as if on cue, as tends to happen with campaign surrogates days before an election, supporters of Hillary Clinton collectively advanced a curious argument. Madeline Albright, the former secretary of state, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/08/us/politics/gloria-steinem-madeleine-albright-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders.html?_r=0\">declared</a> \u201cThere\u2019s a special place in hell for women who don\u2019t help each other\u201d at a Saturday rally in New Hampshire. (It might not have helped much; Clinton would go on to lose lopsidedly.)</span></p> <p><span>On Bill Maher\u2019s show the night before, Gloria Steinem made that shaky premise even more dubious, offering that women supporting Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders were too busy <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/local/abcarian/la-me-ra-pol-prez-gloria-steinem-clinton-20160208-column.html\">chasing</a> men to form their own opinions. \u201cAnd when you\u2019re young, you\u2019re thinking \u2018Where are the boys?\u2019 The boys are with Bernie,\u201d she said, apparently endorsing the same sexist, estrogen-emphasizing arguments of her past opponents.</span></p> <p><span>Steinem has since <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/07/politics/gloria-steinem-sanders-maher/index.html?eref=rss_topstories\">retracted</a>, Albright has <a href=\"http://time.com/4212577/madeleine-albright-hillary-clinton-special-place-hell-defends/\">doubled down</a>, and Clinton played the \u201cGood grief, we\u2019re getting offended by everything these days\u201d <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/07/hillary-clinton-defends-madeleine-albright-women-female-voters\">card</a>, though one prominent partisan of hers\u2014husband Bill Clinton\u2014continued the campaign\u2019s practice of accusing Sanders of sexism by way of insinuation and associative guilt just <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/08/politics/bill-clinton-sanders-supporters-attacks/\">this weekend</a>.</span></p> <p><span>Hillary Clinton gave a neither-here-nor-there endorsement of Albright\u2019s comment, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/07/hillary-clinton-defends-madeleine-albright-women-female-voters\">calling</a> it a \u201clight-hearted but very pointed remark.\u201d Pointed, yes, toward the conclusion that all women should unthinkingly support a women candidate and that the politics of identity eclipse policy. My condolences to the whole of womankind condemned to the fire for being unable to simultaneously support Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.</span></p> <p><span>That the Clinton campaign is in a bad way among millennials is not news. Sanders took <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/07/hillary-clinton-defends-madeleine-albright-women-female-voters\">84 percent</a> of the Iowan millennials\u2014and took the female millennial vote by similarly <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-clinton-millennial-women-20160203-story.html\">lopsided</a> margins\u2014understandably embarrassing for the former secretary of state. Though her campaign has enlisted the support of Lena Dunham, Kim Kardashian, and Katy Perry, nothing appears to have curried female millennial favor.</span></p> <p><span>Clinton\u2019s lazy appeals to womankind to rally behind her will be deservedly derided before dissipating in a few news cycles. But out of the particular emerges the general, and Clinton seems to be drifting into a familiar panicky pattern that forebodes future setbacks: her fondness for employing family consiglieri to do the dirty work, as if none of the stink will ever make its way back to her.</span></p> <p><span>Chelsea Clinton stated, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/14/chelsea-clinton/chelsea-clinton-mischaracterizes-bernie-sanders-he/\">falsely</a>, that Bernie Sanders would \u201cdismantle\u201d Obamacare and the Child Health Insurance Program.

As the awkward, wonky scion helming the political machine of a dynasty that has already exhausted its current eligible stock of presidential candidates, Hillary most resembles Jeb Bush, and she would probably be doing as poorly as star-crossed Jeb were the Democratic electorate as committed to self-immolation as their Republican counterparts.</span></p> <p><span>Worse, less than a <a href=\"http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections/election_2016/do_voters_trust_clinton_trump\">third</a> of voters say they trust Clinton, who is now draping herself tightly in the progressive politics of the Obama era, and can appear a bit of a political chameleon after more than two decades of national prominence. Some of that may be the result of unfair attacks, but not all of it. Witness her recent <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/08/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-now-opposes-trans-pacific-partners/\">about-face</a> on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or her long history of <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/06/hillary-clintons-gay-marriage-problem/372717/\">opposing</a> gay rights before LGBT rights became a campaign platform.</span></p> <p><span>Populism still holds sway among Democrats, but another upstart who seemed far-fetched a few months ago now poses a serious threat to Clinton\u2019s presidential prospects. In frightening moments like these, her campaign tends to fall back on disingenuous attacks that only further its decline.</span></p> <p><span>By tarring male opponents as sexist and condemning dissatisfied woman to perdition, Clinton\u2019s friends turn on its head what seems to be the basic point of feminism\u2014that women be judged equally among men, not preferentially. There are good reasons to support Hillary, and there are good reasons to not. But not letting reason trump baser factionalist impulses is the central point of our democracy.</span></p> <p><span><br></span></p> <p><span><em>Idrees M.

In this election cycle in particular, support for a Democratic candidate might not always predict party affiliation: after all, a recent poll indicated that <a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/265330-some-dems-would-defect-for-trump-poll-shows\">20 percent of Democrats</a> might vote for Republican businessman Donald Trump.</span></p> <p><span>Still, a trend is visible. Even if it isn\u2019t 91 percent or even 84 percent, we should state the obvious: Harvard\u2019s faculty leans left. In a nation that is reasonably divided between conservatives and liberals, 02138 is almost certainly more liberal than the average zip code. At a university that prides itself on the depth of its thought and the diversity of its population, that is a problem.</span></p> <p><span>On this campus, <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/12/1/staff-harvard-diversity-report/\">issues of diversity and underrepresentation</a> are rightly at the forefront.  Whether over the <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/11/19/staff-implicit-explicit-racism/\">racial challenges</a> that <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/11/24/staff-hls-black-tape/\">Harvard schools</a> still face, <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/1/26/staff-tuition-overseers/\">socioeconomic issues</a> that impede access to higher education, or the hugely important <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/2/8/pfister-committee-staff/\">gender- and sexuality-based</a> obstacles that exist, we must continue to commit ourselves to opening our doors still wider. In short, we should value diversity in all its forms.</span></p> <p><span>Tearing down obstacles and righting wrongs should be part of our basic humanity, but the role of diversity is not solely humanitarian. Part of Harvard College\u2019s goal of providing a transformational experience necessitates the broadening of viewpoints that only can occur when students can interact with others of different backgrounds, experiences, and beliefs.</span></p> <p><span>To be clear, racial minorities, women, and Republicans have not had the same experience in this country. We have had one black president, no female presidents, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States\">18 Republicans</a>. Conservatives have not traditionally experienced societal exclusion, been treated as second-class citizens, or felt excluded from the national conversation. Yet if we are genuinely to be committed to an education that broadens perspectives, our campus is poorer for its lack of ideological diversity.</span></p> <p><span>In a country split <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/15370/party-affiliation.aspx\">roughly 50/50</a> between the parties, students should be exposed to both conservative and liberal positions. When the faculty is so deeply ideologically homogenous, at least in the general direction of their beliefs, this is more difficult. A political science or economics course is made less rich when no one is willing to speak up to defend half of the country.</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately, we fear that the perception of bias is sufficient to suppress conservative viewpoints. Regardless of whether the teaching staff shows any partisan proclivities in their grading\u2014and we do not suspect they often do\u2014the presence of a liberal professor and TF combined with a classroom full of <a href=\"http://features.thecrimson.com/2015/senior-survey/\">generally liberal peers</a> might be sufficient to keep a conservative student from speaking up in section. Thus, these campaign contributions numbers alone should worry us.</span></p> <p><span>There are no easy solutions here, just as there are no easy solutions to any of Harvard\u2019s diversity issues. Yet there are tangible steps to be taken. Professors should refrain from unnecessary digs at Republicans and encourage conservative viewpoints in their classroom discussions. Teaching fellows should lead sections that seek to explore both sides of partisan issues, and avoid demonizing all conservatives with a broad brush. Students, for their part, should speak their mind and be willing to listen to conservative perspectives with which they do not agree. Ultimately, this strengthens all of our educations, making us better students and better citizens.</span></p> <p><span>In short, the Kremlin on the Charles could use a little bit of glasnost and perestroika.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Letter to the Editor: Clinton and Appreciating History | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>To the editor:<br></span></p> <p><span>The views recounted in Molly Roberts\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/column/pop-a-molly/article/2016/2/1/Hillary-Clinton-femaleness-president/\">recent</a> <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/02/hillary-clinton-2016-young-women-gender-213620\">pieces</a> on Hillary Clinton and millennials are deeply disappointing. This is not purely a gender issue; rather it reflects a failure by young women and men to appreciate history, the difficulty in achieving progress, and the tentativeness of success.</span></p> <p><span>Abortion was illegal in most states until Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973 shortly before I graduated. Gender discrimination in hiring and compensation was commonplace. The few women who succeeded in climbing male-dominated ladders did so at huge personal sacrifice. They overcame great hostility and gave up much in the process. If today these gray-haired citizens have amassed some money after all they have done, they should not be criticized for it. They earned every dime many times over.</span></p> <p><span>Progress is not linear. No immutable law protects the gains women and men have won over the past decades. Every Republican presidential candidate wants to reverse advances progressives have achieved over the past 50 years. Our country is one or two Supreme Court appointments away from a return to the 1950s. Many members of the House and Senate are already there.</span></p> <p><span>Progress is incremental. Incrementalism is not as much fun as revolution. Revolutions don't tend to happen in countries like ours because people are careful, thoughtful, and concerned about unexpected consequences. Income inequality is a very serious problem, as is the dominance of money in politics. But these problems will not go away simply by political fiat or by politicians demonizing specific groups, be they immigrants, Muslims or Wall Streeters. We could try to deport all illegal immigrants, ban all Muslims, and break up the banks (at a loss of thousands of good jobs for college-educated Millennials). But simplistic \"solutions\" like those won't succeed.</span></p> <p><span>My grandmother was a suffragette. She practiced law in New York City before she could vote. Those who worked hard to make the successes of the past 100 years a reality deserve our respect. I put Hillary Clinton in that group. She doesn't want to get rid of government like the Republicans or double its size as Senator Bernie Sanders has suggested. She wants to work with what we have to make it better and preserve the gains that have been achieved. As far as I'm concerned, it's got nothing at all to do with gender.</span></p> <p><span><em><br></em></span></p> <p><span><em>Kenneth E. Meister \u201973 is a lawyer in New York.</em></span></p>"}

If you are anything like us here at Flyby, you have quite an interesting assortment of characters in your section. You have probably spent the last week trying to figure out how to describe them. Kids in section can at first be hard to characterize, so to help you do so, we find it helpful to liken them to 2016 presidential candidates.</span></p> <p><span><strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> - From the very first day of classes, it\u2019s obvious that she is going to be section kid. She\u2019s over eager, always is the first one to raise her hand when a question is asked, and is clearly not going to let this class stand in the way of her perfect 4.0. Oh and not to mention that it\u2019s day two of class and she\u2019s already BFFs with the TF. Whatever the case, she\u2019s super intense, and for some reason she always gets really quiet whenever anyone mentions an email.</span></p> <p><span><strong>Jeb Bush</strong> - Jeb is the overtly nerdy guy clad in glasses and a scruffy sweatshirt. At a school literally chocked full of the nerdiest people from around the world, that shouldn\u2019t be a problem. Unfortunately for Jeb, there\u2019s just something about him that makes you want to pick him up by his belt loops and drop him in the nearest dumpster, glee-style. That, or steal his calculator when he\u2019s not looking.</span></p> <p><span><strong>Bernie Sanders </strong>- Put simply, Bernie is the kid in section who, week after week, spends 20 minutes articulating his own opinion in front of the whole class. He certainly has no problem expressing his views, regardless of how radical they may be. You secretly agree with him, and will always admire his ability to bring the class off topic.</span></p> <p><span><strong>Marco Rubio </strong>-  You want to like him, you truly do, but he has the tendency to aggressively repeat the same line over and over again. The first time that he said it, it was almost intelligent. the seventh time? Not so much.</span></p> <p><span><strong>Donald Trump</strong> - You know that arrogant student that saunters into class late every section? That\u2019s Donald. He\u2019ll boast all class long about his success on HCCG and his fondness for summering in the Hamptons. He has \u201cyuuuge\u201d plans, and he\u2019s not afraid to let everyone in section know about them. Plus you can count on him to slip in the occasional offensive comment that will invariably lead to uproar.</span></p> <p><span><strong>John Kasich</strong> - You think he is a likable member of your section class, and you feel sort of bad that he is often talked over by some of the more brash members of your section.</span></p> <p><span><strong>Ben Carson</strong> - You don\u2019t quite know what to think about this kid. He\u2019s quiet to the point of almost not existing, and when he does speak up, he says something either completely unrelated to the topic at hand, or is way off the mark. It\u2019s obvious that he hasn\u2019t done any of the readings since the semester began and is getting by on the tid-bits that he hears his classmates discussing.</span></p> <p><span><strong>Ted Cruz</strong> - Whenever it comes to debates, you want to have this guy in your corner. Apparently he\u2019s a big shot on the debate team? It\u2019s a shame they lost to that prison team earlier this year, though it doesn\u2019t seem to have done anything to deflate his ego.

{"title": "AROUND THE IVIES: Weekend to Shake Up Tight Ancient Eight Standings | Sports | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "David Freed", "body": "<p><span>Every time Columbia basketball gets moving, the world has a funny way of knocking it to its knees.</span></p> <p><span>Up four with just 10 seconds to go last Saturday, Columbia borrowed a page out of its own book. Recently the most defining quality of Columbia has been its ability to, and I paraphrase Drake, drop from a hundred to zero real quick. It happened in Jadwin and Lavietes last year, against Harvard in Levien the year before, and even showed up when the Lions traveled to Kentucky.</span></p> <p><span>Princeton was the last in a long line of Lions tormentors, scoring 10 points in the final 30 seconds of regulation to tie a game it would eventually win by five in overtime. Freshman Devin Cannady had the dagger\u2014a bomb just inside the scorer\u2019s table to tie the game with four seconds left\u2014to cap the run, which vaulted Princeton into sole control of second place in the league with Yale coming to town.</span></p> <p><span>While the focus lies on Columbia\u2019s inability to shake its late-game tormentors, which have persisted longer than the Cha Cha Slide, the more important long-term takeaway may have been Princeton\u2019s ascendance. By most standard <a href=\"mailto:http://www.nycbuckets.com/2016/02/ivy-league-midseason-breakdown/\">efficiency</a> metrics, this year\u2019s Tigers team has been better than four of the last five league champions\u2014only undefeated Yale has been better. The Bulldogs had a quiet weekend, overcoming a half of lackluster play against Dartmouth to come up with two dominant road wins. Star forward Justin Sears, who <a href=\"mailto:https://www.facebook.com/givethemLOP%3Ffref=ts\">said</a> last year beating Harvard was one of the two reasons he came to New Haven, had little to say after the win, <a href=\"mailto:http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/eye-on-college-basketball/25487245/yale-hasnt-made-the-ncaas-since-1962-but-that-should-absolutely-change-in-4-weeks\">calling</a> Harvard just another \u201croadblock.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>With six games to go, Yale\u2019s biggest test comes Friday in Jadwin. Princeton\u2014located just 30 minutes way from where Sears grew up\u2014is the only team to lose to Yale by less than 10 points this year. Its wings, juniors Stephen Cook, Spencer Weisz, and Henry Caruso, combine with the fearsome Amir Bell-Cannady point guard hydra give the Tigers shooters at four positions. They are the only team who can move Sears, who rarely ventures out from the paint on defense, and frontcourt teammate Brandon Sherrod around on offense.</span></p> <p><span>If Yale is worried, they aren\u2019t showing it. Fresh off his third straight win at Lavietes, a first for any opponent during Tommy Amaker\u2019s time in Cambridge, Yale coach James Jones offered his opinion this week that the team\u2019s last game with the Tigers wasn\u2019t really that <a href=\"mailto:http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/eye-on-college-basketball/25487245/yale-hasnt-made-the-ncaas-since-1962-but-that-should-absolutely-change-in-4-weeks\">close</a> at all. Jones is a brutally honest quote, but also a single-minded competitor. He\u2019s the longest-tenured Division I basketball coach in America not to have made the big Dance, and comes off as very aware of it. He\u2019s twice lost in a playoff, and last year\u2019s Dartmouth loss was about as painful as a defeat can be.</span></p> <p><span>Yet he should be worried about the Tigers. Cannady and Bell are two of the only players in the league who can keep up with his lightning quick point guard, sophomore Makai Mason. Yale lost its senior point guard Jack Montague this week indefinitely to personal leave, the causes of which are pure speculation, and the result is that it has just one guard on its bench\u2014senior Khaliq Ghani\u2014Jones trusts to play big minutes. Yale made an atypical 11 threes last time against Princeton, something it is unlikely to repeat with Montague gone.</span></p> <p><span>On the other side, Caruso has to be accounted for. The junior had his worst game of the season against Columbia, making just one of 10 shots, but one of his best the last time out against Yale. He got his 26 points in a variety of ways, flummoxing the bigger Yale defenders that Jones threw at him. He ranks fifth in the league in scoring and an impressive fourth in field goal percentage, ahead of Sherrod\u2014owner of an the NCAA-record 30 straight makes.</span></p> <p><span>While Yale is the team with the longer NCAA Tournament berth drought, Caruso represents a legion of Princeton juniors who have never tasted success. He, Cook, and Weisz have toiled in the league\u2019s middle class for the better part of three years, watching Yale and Harvard fight tooth and nail for the last two titles. The trio was unable to shake the hegemony with a single victory in their first five tries, but aced their first test at home this year, scoring 53 points on 40 shots in a clinical 21-point dismantling of the Crimson.</span></p> <p><span>Friday poses a much harder midterm, but a stronger reward. Win and Princeton shifts the entire dynamic of the league, violently grabbing the driver\u2019s seat from the team whose pro-rated start would make it arguably the best Ivy champion ever. Yale still has to go to Columbia, while Princeton gets the Lions at home. If Princeton can win, something it has done nine of the last 10 times, it will have the inside track to the \u2018ship.</span></p> <p><span>As for the remaining seven games:</span></p> <p><span>HARVARD AT COLUMBIA</span></p> <p><span>Harvard senior Patrick Steeves noted after losing to Penn that \u201cwe\u2019re going to play all these guys again.\u201d There\u2019s no team, save perhaps Princeton, that Harvard would want to play more than Columbia\u2014whose celebration after finally exercising their demons at Lavietes was outlandish. The Lions have not impressed in the last four games, but retain Maodo Lo\u2014one of the league\u2019s most talented players and, if his coach can <a href=\"mailto:http://columbiaspectator.com/sports/2016/02/18/kyle-smiths-sphere-influence\">get his way</a>, a future NBA draft pick.</span></p> <p><span><em>Pick: Columbia</em></span></p> <p><span>DARTMOUTH AT CORNELL</span></p> <p><span>These two schools share much in common: destitute locales, rowdy student bodies, and a commitment to playing one good weekend of basketball an Ivy League season.

Their annual football game, a sweater vest and Brooks Brothers affair if there ever was one, is the second-longest running rivalry in the country with its share of high points. The two schools have combined for 35 national titles, tops among any rivalry, and ruled the league before the rise of Harvard and Penn. Princeton\u2019s 65-yard drop-kick to win the 1882 game remains an iconic moment in history, if not only to serve as evidence for the theory that before the forward pass came along, kickers pulled more than quarterbacks.</span></p> <p><span>While it\u2019s been icy\u2014past Yale football players have <a href=\"mailto:http://dailyprincetonian.com/sports/2008/04/new-film-explores-football-history/\">called</a> Princeton their biggest rival\u2014the most profane airing of sparks happened in November, when Princeton freshman Sam Bellet, a self-proclaimed future student of \u201cMen\u2019s and Women\u2019s Studies,\u201d slammed air quotes around the world rivalry and echoed his inner Donald Trump in saying that \u201cPrinceton has had one of the most successful Halloweens in Halloween history whereas Yale can\u2019t even decide what costume to put on.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Howard, I do worry about these youth.</span></p> <p><span><em>Pick: Princeton</em></span></p> <p><span>BROWN AT PENN</span></p> <p><span>This week\u2019s journalism award goes to <em>The Daily Pennsylvanian\u2019s</em> Round-Up column, a Wednesday reminder of teenage exceptionalism.

I\u2019m not talking about political correctness\u2014the idea that we should avoid offensive language for its own sake. I\u2019m talking about the metaphors that are the currency of our politics: terms like \u201cillegals\u201d for undocumented immigrants or \u201ctax relief\u201d for promised tax credits. The phrases repeated so often that they become clich\u00e9. <br></span></p> <p><span>I\u2019m going to argue that as these formulations enter political discourse, they evoke images that can color our political consciences\u2014for example, of Mexicans as law-breakers and taxes as heavy burdens. And that whenever we participate in a political debate, we bolster one side or the other with the words we use to express our position.</span></p> <p><span>To argue politics persuasively, be strategic about the language you use.</span></p> <p><span>The debate over immigration reform exemplifies the power of language to frame the nature of the policy problem. Turn on talk radio or go to a Trump rally, and you\u2019ll hear the people under discussion referred to with phrases like \u201cillegal immigrants,\u201d \u201cillegal aliens,\u201d or even just \u201cillegals.\u201d Language like this ignores the human context in which immigrants live and make choices. Instead, it suggests that they should be identified and labeled based on a single binary: their relationship to American immigration law. It is the ultimate form of other-ing, making callous formulations like <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/08/donald-trumps-false-comments-connecting-mexican-immigrants-and-crime/\">Trump</a>\u2019s possible: \u201cThey\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>More humane terms like \u201cundocumented immigrant,\u201d \u201cundocumented worker,\u201d or \u201casylum seeker\u201d suggest that the debate over immigration policy is about something completely different. They categorize immigrants in terms of their willingness to work, the danger or poverty in their home country, and their affection for American values. And they imply that when men and women decide to cross the border \u201cwithout documents,\u201d they do so often for the safety and welfare of their families. Gone is the insinuation that immigrants feel a sense of entitlement, or disrespect the rule of law.</span></p> <p><span>What do Americans think about immigration reform? It all depends on how you phrase the question. An April <a href=\"http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/current_events/immigration/april_2015/most_still_oppose_obama_s_immigration_amnesty_say_it_s_illegal\">poll</a> from Rasmussen Reports found that, by a 56-35 margin, Americans disapprove of President Obama\u2019s \u201camnesty\u201d policy that allows \u201cillegal immigrants\u2026to remain in this country legally and apply for jobs.\u201d But a <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/184577/favor-path-citizenship-illegal-immigrants.aspx\">Gallup</a> study from August found that 65 percent\u2014including the majority of Republicans\u2014favor a substantially similar policy if it is described as a \u201cpathway to citizenship.\u201d The fate of ten million people may well hang on which phrase wins out.</span></p> <p><span>Metaphor may matter even more when we conceptualize abstract policy questions. As Nicholas Kristof has <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/17/opinion/sunday/some-inconvenient-gun-facts-for-liberals.html\">argued</a>, liberal rhetoric surrounding the contentious issue of \u201cgun control\u201d implies that Democrats want the government to control who can own a gun, or ban guns altogether. These narratives blend with the visual image of the government taking control of people's guns, becoming so closely associated that merely uttering the words \"gun control\" becomes counterproductive.</span></p> <p><span>Surveys show that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/most-gun-owners-support-background-checks-and-other-limits-so-why-arent-their-voices-heard/2015/10/07/af9c96b0-6c41-11e5-aa5b-f78a98956699_story.html\">most gun owners</a> support common sense restrictions on firearms. (For some perspective, only 6 to 7 <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/15/most-gun-owners-dont-belong-to-the-nra-and-they-dont-agree-with-it-either/\">percent</a> of American gun owners are N.R.A. members.) But once a cognitive frame is established in which \u201cgun control\u201d equates to gun confiscation, moderates are prompted to respond emotionally rather than rationally. Perhaps this is why Congress has taken no action in three years since Sandy Hook, even though <a href=\"http://www.quinnipiac.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/national/release-detail?releaseid=2312\">89 percent of Americans support </a>requiring background checks at gun shows. That\u2019s why Kristof suggests ditching the phrase, and saying \u201cgun safety\u201d instead. Linguistic precision barely figures into it; we should care about the results.</span></p> <p><span>Movements to change the language we use have already had an impact. In 2013, a petition demanding that leading news agencies stop using the term \u201cillegal immigrant\u201d <a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/fishbowlny/group-plans-protest-of-new-york-times-for-use-of-illegal-immigrant/82067?red=ny\">gathered</a> over 70,000 signatures. In response, the AP changed its style guide. The New York Times stopped short of a full-scale ban, but put <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/24/business/media/the-times-shifts-on-illegal-immigrant-but-doesnt-ban-the-use.html\">limits</a> on the phrase\u2019s use. The debate <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-34061097\" target=\"_blank\">continues</a> today, as millions of Syrian migrants\u2014or should I say \u201crefugees\u201d\u2014pour into Europe.</span></p> <p><span>Debates like this convince me that, despite all its flaws, the culture of political correctness has been a good thing for our society. By forcing us to recognize the harm our words can do, it has taught us to think before speaking, and to own the vocabulary we use. Now it is time for us to aim higher\u2014to pay attention to our language because we want it to describe our values, not just because we fear causing offense.</span></p> <p><span>In his famous essay, \u201cPolitics and the English Language,\u201d George Orwell argued that the most fundamental terms in our political discourse\u2014socialist, fascist, middle class\u2014have become muddled almost to the point of meaninglessness. \u201cWhat is above all needed is to let the meaning choose the word, and not the other way around,\u201d Orwell wrote. \u201cIn prose, the worst thing you can do with words is to surrender to them.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Whatever our politics, let\u2019s stop surrendering to words, and start talking about what they\u2019re actually saying.</span></p> <p><span><br></span></p> <p><span><em>Eyck A.

Or correct the Supreme Court on campaign finance through a constitutional amendment of all things?</span></p> <p><span>Without an actual political revolution or realignment materializing at the behest of a socialist septuagenarian, Americans would relive the familiar duping of \u201chope and change.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>That\u2019s not to say that the Obama presidency will be remembered as a failure\u2014far from it. But his signature achievements, like the Affordable Care Act, Dodd-Frank, or the deal with Iran, came out a bit crooked, refracted through the prism of pessimism and partisanship. And at the same time, civil libertarians have much to be disappointed by\u2014<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/30/magazine/the-lessons-of-anwar-al-awlaki.html\">the first targeted killing</a> of an American citizen without a trial, the disclosure of broad-sweeping <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/04/us/winning-surveillance-limits-obama-makes-program-own.html\">surveillance programs</a>, and the continued detention facility at Guantanamo Bay.</span></p> <p><span>But incrementalism\u2014the kind endorsed by Hillary Clinton, whose essential campaign promise is to continue the Obama years\u2014makes for much less tantalizing campaigns.</span></p> <p><span>And in our hyperpolarized era, it might not even make sense. There are two basic ways that a candidate may gain votes through effective campaigning: either by convincing some voters to change their minds or encouraging the registered adults already partial to their cause to actually show up to the polls. Given that primary participation rates in the last presidential election <a href=\"http://bipartisanpolicy.org/library/national-primary-turnout-hits-new-record-low/\">hovered</a> around 20 percent, it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the turnout effect\u2014the kind aroused by negative campaigning and stirring cries to break up the banks or deport illegal immigrants\u2014is much more important than attempting to convince undecided voters.</span></p> <p><span>In a hypothetical general election, a voter who decides to change his vote from Hillary Clinton to John Kasich\u2014probably the two closest candidates across party lines left standing\u2014would go from an outspoken advocate for abortion rights to a man who <a href=\"https://johnkasich.com/respectinghumanlife/\">prides himself</a> on <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/21/politics/john-kasich-planned-parenthood-bill/\">defunding</a> Planned Parenthood.

All that is to say that the possibility seems marginal, and, further, the people on those margins would seem to be deeply confused about essentially everything anyway.</span></p> <p><span>Mobilizing an electorate is not so easy. Donald Trump seems best at this sort of game, coming out with some brash statement, equal parts bombast and bluster, with hardly a sniff of substance that is duly rehashed over the airwaves and recounted in articles for the next several days.

As a result, he enjoys the support of a wide range of influential public personalities <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/rwanda/7900680/Paul-Kagame-Rwandas-redeemer-or-ruthless-dictator.html\">including</a> Bill Clinton, Tony Blair, Bill Gates and Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz.</span></p> <p><span>But incontrovertible facts have emerged, and they bring to light the other side of Kagame\u2019s story.  According to the Rwanda scholar Filip Reyntjens, Kagame <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/case-against-rwandas-president-paul-kagame-63167\">is</a> \u201cprobably the worst war criminal in office today.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In 2002, Americans were warned by ABC News\u2019 Ted Koppel, who <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/story?id=128597\">introduced</a> the first documentary on the war in Democratic Republic of the Congo (Congo DRC) by stating,<em> </em>\u201cAt the heart of the continent, genocide in a tiny country [Rwanda], a genocide that horrified the world, brought chaos to a country almost 100 times its size [the Congo DRC], and you probably haven\u2019t heard a word\u2026. It has claimed more lives than all the other current wars around the world combined. But outside of Africa, no one seems to have noticed.\" The program went on to observe, \"[September 11th] was the day when 3,000 people died in the World Trade Center alone. In Congo, almost that many people have died each and every day.\u201d Kagame was the key instigator of these events.</span></p> <p><span>In 2008, 40 Rwandan officers were <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/02/06/spain.indictments.rwanda/\">prosecuted</a> by the Spanish judge Fernando Andreu Merelles for \"genocide, crimes against humanity and terrorism,\" and Kagame was implicated for claiming 4 million lives in his quest for geo-strategical supremacy. Protected by his immunity as a head of state, Kagame could not be indicted.</span></p> <p><span>In 2010, the United Nations Human Rights Commission <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/CD/DRC_MAPPING_REPORT_FINAL_EN.pdf\">issued</a> a mapping of human rights violations in the Congo DRC from 1993 to 2003, and raised the question of whether some of Kagame\u2019s actions might be classified \"crimes of genocide.\"</span></p> <p><span>At home, Kagame is ruling with an iron hand by quashing and eradicating the opposition and by muzzling the media. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/29/world/africa/29rwanda.html?_r=0\"><span class=\"Hyperlink0\">Victoire Ingabire</span></a>, a Sakharov prize <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/20120921STO51984/2012-Sakharov-Prize-find-out-who-has-been-nominated\">nominee</a>, was arrested and jailed because she planned to run for the presidency. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/03/world/africa/former-rwanda-spy-chief-karegeya-found-dead.html\">Patrick Karegeya</a>, a former intelligence officer and close collaborator of Kagame\u2019s, was assassinated in a hotel in Johannesburg, South Africa. As a reaction, Kagame stated that treason brings consequences<em>,</em> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-25713774\">adding</a> that \u201canyone who betrays our cause or wishes our people ill will fall victim. What remains to be seen is how you fall victim.\u201d In 2014, soon after the BBC broadcasted \u201cRwanda\u2019s Untold Story<em>,</em>\u201d a documentary challenging Kagame and his role in the 1994 genocide, Rwanda pushed for criminal action against the channel, and BBC broadcasting was consequently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/mar/02/bbc-rwanda-documentary-inquiry\">suspended</a> in Rwanda.</span></p> <p><span>Over the last weeks, the international community has strongly criticized Kagame for obstructing the democratic transition of his own country, and for his destabilizing role in the African Great Lakes region. At a time when Africa is thirsty for sustainable democracy, Kagame \u2013 de-facto leader of Rwanda since 1994 \u2013 has set an adverse precedent by <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/editorials/2016/02/25/africa-constitutional-coups-can-just-damaging-military-coups/3aKRWUtYruged3DnhnRO8N/story.html\">pushing</a> a constitutional reform that granted himself the opportunity to stay in power until 2034.  And ironically, the hero who once ended the 1994 mass killing in Rwanda is <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-35546617\">fueling</a> a crisis in Burundi that may well lead to another genocide.</span></p> <p><span>While not an open supporter of Kagame, Harvard has provided a powerful platform for Kagame on several occasions in the past. In 2001, when the war that Kagame fueled in the Congo DRC was costing thousands of lives every day, Kagame was <a href=\"http://www.iop.harvard.edu/content/paul-kagame-accomplishments-and-challenges-reconciliation-and-reconstruction-rwanda\">invited</a> to speak at the Harvard Kennedy School. In 2013, after the US and several European nations <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21569438-will-rwandas-widely-praised-development-plans-now-be-stymied-pain\">suspended</a> aid to Rwanda amid allegations that Rwanda supported rebel insurgencies in Congo, Kagame <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vehOYF9srcY\">spoke</a> at the Harvard Business School as a guest of prominent professor Michael Porter.  Now, despite growing criticisms from the international community, Kagame has once again been invited to speak at Harvard-related events. It is certain that the accommodation of Kagame by such a prestigious institution as Harvard has been fueling Kagame\u2019s propaganda both domestically and internationally.</span></p> <p><span>Does Harvard want to keep letting its name be used by a ruthless dictator? I do not think so. It is hard to imagine that Harvard would open its doors to leaders that are responsible for similar such atrocities, such as Bashar al-Assad of Syria or Omar al-Bashir from Sudan.</span></p> <p><span>By welcoming Kagame, Harvard is abdicating its moral responsibility to denounce tyrannical regimes and to give a voice to the voiceless.  Our motto as a school is Veritas\u2014truth. Yet this weekend, we find ourselves not speaking truth to power.

It set the party\u2019s politicians up to make a series of promises they couldn\u2019t keep,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Referencing the 2016 Presidential election, Dionne said the practice of making unrealistic promises has resurfaced among Republican presidential candidates. Dionne charged that Donald J. Trump, for instance, has expressed interest in reversing the effects of the 1965 Immigration Act and returning the ethnic makeup of the United States back to that of the 1940s and 1950s.</span></p> <p><span>Dionne said many Republicans have felt betrayed and disappointed by their party\u2019s rhetoric and leadership even since the 1930s. Reducing the size of federal government has been a common strategy of Republican rhetoric, despite difficulty in practice, he added.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cGovernment was exactly the same size as the share of GDP when Ronald Reagan left office as when Ronald Reagan took office,\u201d Dionne said. \u201cAmericans can be quite critical of government in the abstract, but in the end, they want a great deal from government.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Dionne also argued that broken promises have caused moderate and liberal voters to increasingly retreat from the ranks of the GOP, moving the \u201ccenter of gravity\u201d of the party from the Northeast to the South.</span></p> <p><span>Thomas E. Patterson, Professor of Government and the Press at the Kennedy School\u2019s Shorenstein Center, moderated the discussion that followed.

Trump\u2019s presidential campaign in a Sunday op-ed that has generated widespread reaction.</span></p> <p><span>Allen said she found the need to write the op-ed for The Washington Post after Trump\u2019s victory in Saturday\u2019s Republican primary in South Carolina. Describing the primary as a \u201cturning point,\u201d Allen wrote in the piece that voters should recognize that there is not much time left to change the outcome of the Republican presidential nomination contest.</span></p> <p><span>In the op-ed, which now has over 5000 online comments, Allen examined the dangers she perceived in Trump\u2019s rise to political prominence, which she believes is a product of growing divisions in the United States. Instead of choosing not to challenge Trump, Americans must support \u201ccoordination across party lines and across divisions within parties,\u201d Allen wrote.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe, the people, need to find somewhere, buried in the recesses of our fading memories, the capacity to make common cause against this formidable threat to our equally shared liberties,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe time is now.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Allen said she has received a wide range of opinions in response to her article, from the candidate\u2019s supporters as well as his critics.</span></p> <p><span>She wrote in her piece that Trump\u2019s popularity has allowed her to understand how Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler was able to take control of Germany in the early 1930s. In an interview, Allen said she is not focused on exploring the direct comparison between Hitler and Trump, a point she also made in her op-ed.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe fact that particular historical moments can teach us things that help us understand different moments doesn\u2019t mean that there is a straight comparison between them,\u201d she said. \u201cThe thing that requires comparison is the question of when and how do demagogues acquire power.

{"title": "A Poor Choice of Commencement Speaker | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Imagine if one of Harvard\u2019s schools chose Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, or Bernie Sanders as its commencement speaker in the midst of the 2016 campaign season. Such a selection would not only raise eyebrows, but it would also threaten the university\u2019s tax-exempt status\u2014IRS rules <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/Charities-&amp;-Non-Profits/Charitable-Organizations/Frequently-Asked-Questions-About-the-Ban-on-Political-Campaign-Intervention-by-501(c)(3)-Organizations:-Inviting-a-Candidate-to-Speak\">prohibit</a> non-profit organizations like Harvard from engaging in partisan, election-related activities. By law, any event giving a platform to political hopefuls must be carefully organized as a multi-candidate forum.</span></p> <p><span>Beyond the question of what is legal, it would be wrong for a university administration to tilt the balance towards any one presidential candidate. A university is supposed to be a place for us to cultivate our critical thinking skills, a place where we can freely express and debate political ideas. When faculty deans\u2014who make decisions about hiring and firing faculty, and about distributing funding\u2014appear to take sides rather than encourage open discussion, it is tantamount to a restriction on academic freedom. Faculty, staff, and students who want to support Secretary Clinton\u2019s political opponents, either in the context of academic debate or participation in campaign organization, may think twice if they perceive that the administration holds an opposing position. In an environment where people must compete for promotions, tenure, and financial aid, many of our community members would rather avoid conflict with those in power.</span></p> <p><span>But what if the commencement speaker were not a presidential candidate, but a 40-year confidant of a presidential candidate and the head of that candidate\u2019s eponymous foundation? That is the question raised by Acting Dean David Hunter\u2019s decision to invite Donna Shalala, president of the Bill, Hillary &amp; Chelsea Clinton Foundation, as the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health\u2019s 2016 Commencement speaker. Dean Hunter invited Shalala despite concerns raised by Chan School student government leaders over email, who told him that the selection would amount to a tacit political endorsement. The announcement was made on Feb. 24, less than a week before the Massachusetts primary, and noted the Clinton Foundation affiliation in the first sentence of his email.</span></p> <p><span>Shalala met the Clintons before they married in 1975. She served as director of the Children\u2019s Defense Fund, coinciding with Hillary Clinton\u2019s tenure as a board member from 1986 to 1992. Shalala then served as Secretary of Health and Human Services under President Bill Clinton from 1993 to 2001. At a 2014 event held at University of Miami, where Shalala served as president, she and Hillary Clinton <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7nLr7PE-as\">hugged</a> and the former Secretary of State went on to <a href=\"http://www.distractionmagazine.com/2014/02/28/hillary-clinton-visits-the-u/\">share stories</a> about their friendship.</span></p> <p><span>A month after Hillary Clinton announced her candidacy, Shalala left her position at University of Miami to become director of the Clinton Foundation. Shalala took the reins at a time when the organization had been dogged by negative publicity concerning infighting and conflicts of interest. She likely took a substantial pay cut to work for the Clintons: Shalala earned <a href=\"http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=4673#.Vs6QqHjyDvw\">nearly</a> $1 million dollars at University of Miami in 2014, whereas the outgoing president of the Clinton Foundation <a href=\"https://www.clintonfoundation.org/sites/default/files/clinton_foundation_report_public_2014.pdf\">earned</a> closer to $500,000 that same year.</span></p> <p><span>Shalala has a wealth of leadership experience in the fields of health care advocacy and administration. She has taken principled positions in her career, serving as a voice of internal <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/clinton/interviews/shalala.html\">dissent</a> during Bill Clinton\u2019s 1996 welfare reform initiative, which restricted access to public benefits and healthcare. In any other year, it would be an honor to have her speak at the Chan School\u2019s commencement. But this year we must, as a school of public health, be able to have an open and ongoing conversation about our country\u2019s political future. This can only happen if our institution maintains official neutrality. Given Shalala\u2019s extremely close ties to a presidential candidate during an election year, Dean Hunter should apologize to her, rescind the invitation, and ask her to come back in 2017.</span></p> <p><span><em><br></em></span></p> <p><span><em>Justin Feldman</em> <em>is a doctoral candidate in the Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences at the Harvard T.H.

{"title": "The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>\u201cThe paradox is you\u2019ve got a billionaire leading a class war in the Republican party.\u201d<br></span></p> <p><span>E.J. Dionne \u201973, a Washington Post columnist, MSNBC contributor, and NPR commentator, recently stopped by The Brattle Theater to talk about his new book, \u201cWhy The Right Went Wrong,\u201d in an event hosted by The Harvard Bookstore. But before taking the stage and engaging with the crowd on topics ranging from Winston Churchill to angry internet commenters, Dionne took some time to answer our questions.</span></p> <p><span><strong>Fifteen Minutes: One of the most fascinating ideas in your book is the idea that GOP leaders since 1964 have consistently let their followers down by making promises they couldn\u2019t keep. I\u2019m wondering how you think that trend has been reshaped recently, when, ironically, that radical wing is promising things that are less and less plausible, and yet is garnering even more votes than they have in the past. Why do you think Republican voters are aligning with more radical candidates?</strong></span></p> <p><span>E. J. Dionne: In the case of Trump and immigration, even though some in the party claim to be for immigration reform, they\u2019ve used a rhetoric about the dangers of immigration and the notion that people were pouring across the borders even when immigration from Mexico had fallen below zero. The voters heard that... but they also sensed a lot of their leaders didn\u2019t believe it. So, they decided to vote for the guy who actually seems to believe it, and the very radicalism of what he says\u2014even if it is utterly unrealistic to deport 11 million people and build a wall that [we don\u2019t pay for]\u2014he has a peculiar credibility, because somebody who\u2019s willing to say something that radical must actually believe it. I think that\u2019s sort of what happens with broken promises.</span></p> <p><span>One of my favorite lines about politics is [by] John F. Kennedy. In his inaugural address, he said: \u201cHe who foolishly seeks power by riding the back of the tiger ends up inside.\u201d I think that\u2019s what\u2019s happened to a lot of the traditional leaders of the party. I think they were willing to exploit the feelings of rather militant constituencies, like the Tea Party, and thought they could keep them under control. Now, it seems like those militant constituencies are firing back.</span></p> <p><span><strong>FM</strong>: <strong>You praise Eisenhower in the book for not pretending that he could \u201croll back the New Deal.\u201d What\u2019s interesting is that Trump is kind of the only Republican in the field who feels the same way about entitlements and other government programs. Do you think that preserving those things, or not trying to have a radical fight with the third rail, is helping Trump out as well, or do you think it\u2019s mostly this radical, on-the-nose rhetoric that is garnering him support?</strong></span></p> <p><span>EJD: Trump is confounding because half of Trump is really reactionary on race and Muslims and immigration, [while] part of Trump is almost \u201cmoderate,\u201d which is why he gets votes from \u201cmoderates,\u201d because he is willing to acknowledge the importance of social security. He even talks about negotiating the price of prescription drugs under Medicare, which is a democratic idea. I think that speaks straight to his constituency because the Republican Party has relied on white working class votes for decades and has done nothing for them. And that\u2019s a constituency that likes Trump\u2019s social conservatism and hard line on certain questions, but actually is not opposed to social security or medicare or other aspects of government assistance. What struck me about the Trump vote is that his support is pretty constant across ideological categories, but his support is class split. The paradox is you\u2019ve got a billionaire leading a class war in the Republican Party.</span></p> <p><span><strong>FM</strong><strong>: A paradox you hit on in the book is that the Republican Party is really working locally\u2014it\u2019s taken over the House and the Senate\u2014but on the national level, they haven\u2019t done as well. Some say this is because they haven\u2019t gone far enough to the right, some say it is because they\u2019ve come to far to the middle, which raises the question: How do you get the Republican Party on a local level to become more moderate and change their beliefs when it\u2019s working so well on the local and statewide level? </strong></span></p> <p><span>EJD: The problem Republicans face is that what helps them in midterm elections is the very thing that is their long-term problem. The Republican constituency is aging, and the conservative constituency is aging. In 1987, Pew found that only 39 percent of conservatives were over 50; In 2014, 53 percent were. That\u2019s probably higher now. So, they can hang on to power in midterm elections\u2014and Democrats do have to figure out how to turn out voters in midterms\u2014but that very fact says in the long run they\u2019re in big trouble, because the older voters eventually go on to their eternal reward and younger voters are the future. And so, sure Republicans know that yes, this might work in a midterm election or two more, but it doesn\u2019t hold up for the long term.</span></p> <p><span><strong>FM</strong><strong>: Going off of that, there\u2019s also the demographic shift\u2014there are a lot more Latino American Voters, African American voters, Asian American voters. Texas might turn blue in the next 10 years. How does the Republican Party account for that and shift its policies towards a more accepting future, when its core base of voters is holding on to this xenophobia in a desperate way? What will incentivize the shift? Losing?</strong></span></p> <p><span>EJD: I think there\u2019s a rule of three in politics. If you look at the '80s, the Democrats lost three presidential elections and made some adjustments under Clinton so they could win. The Tories in Britain lost three elections in a row to Tony Blair, and along comes David Cameron with a project that involves moderation and modernizations. And I think losing a third Presidential election will open more space in the Republican Party. Or, alternatively, if they win, I just don\u2019t think a right wing project is going to win them reelection, because the country is not a right wing country.</span></p> <p><span><strong>FM</strong><strong>: You talk about how Charles Krauthammer said: \u201cYou can choose your Reagan.\u201d And I think that idea is especially pertinent when you look at this election and see how everybody\u2019s claiming they\u2019re the heir to Ronald Reagan. I know that the whole point of that quote is that there\u2019s no way to pigeonhole Reagan. But who do you think, in spirit or as a politician, most embodies that legacy? </strong></span></p> <p><span>EJD: I think the first thing to say is that I don\u2019t think Ronald Reagan himself, political realist that he was, would think that the way to win an election in 2016 is to be a guy who was last elected in 1984. In fairness to conservatives, we progressives still hang on to and revere Franklin Roosevelt, and I do too, so I get the reverence. But being exactly Franklin Roosevelt in 2016 wouldn\u2019t work either. Secondly, the whole problem with using Reagan as a model is this ambiguity that Charles and others have talked about. There was a movement Reagan, who was the Reagan who gave the great speech for Barry Goldwater in 1964, who right wingers can say [is] the real Reagan. Then there was actually the governing Reagan, who was blessed to have to govern with Democrats and was prepared to govern in a moderate way\u2014who was willing to raise taxes after cutting them when it didn\u2019t work\u2026</span></p> <p><span>In the end, I don\u2019t think any of them is exactly who Reagan was. And maybe because I always thought one of the most important aspects of Reagan was that he was an FDR democrat, and therefore had an instinctive understanding\u2014even though he abandoned liberalism\u2014of FDR kinds of constituencies. And in the party now, there is very little optimism of the Reagan sort, and I think one of the big problems with the modern right is that it is so pessimistic about America as it is now\u2014pessimistic about the values of the country, pessimistic, in some cases, about the ethnic makeup of the country\u2014and Reagan\u2019s optimism was a very important part of his appeal. I like to say that Reagan stole optimism from FDR and Clinton stole it back from Reagan. And Obama has continued that.</span></p> <p><span><strong>FM</strong><strong>: Yeah, \u201cChange We Can Believe In.\u201d</strong></span></p> <p><span>EJD: I think the Republicans could use a lot more of what Sarah Palin called, \u201cThe Hopey Changey stuff.\u201d</span></p>"}
