{"title": "My Primary Concern: Fashion | Arts | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The other day I was at the gym doing a pilates routine and reading about whether Suri Cruise really is the spawn of L. Ron Hubbard. I actually think she is. I have thought that ever since I realized, purely through my own powers of deductive reasoning, that Katie Holmes had been pregnant for approximately 18 months, wearing what appeared to be a prosthetic stomach for half of that time.  No one believed me then.<br><br>Anyway, while I was reading and sneaking self-congratulatory smiles at myself in the full length mirror, some earnest-looking individual decided that we should watch the primary debates. I had no real objection to this, as \u201cJeopardy!\u201d was over. In fact, I was rather excited. Think of the outfit that Hillary Clinton will be wearing!  <br><br>I should probably interject that I have never voted and that my idea of civic responsibility is my encyclopedic knowledge of the contents of Jackie Kennedy\u2019s wedding trousseau. I am sure this offends many of you, and this doesn\u2019t bother me. If you grew up in Rhode Island, home to four electoral votes and the only state in the union to have a mayor, a governor and two Supreme Court justices all in jail at the same time, I doubt you would vote either.<br><br>Though I feel incapable of assessing any of the candidates\u2019 positions on healthcare or campaign finance reform, I do feel I can offer them some fashion advice. Seriously, if any of these fools want to be president they really need to step their game up and start looking the part.<br><br>John McCain<br><br>John McCain is really old. I noticed this pretty much immediately. During the most recent Republican debate, which seemed to take place inside of an airplane hangar, McCain seemed to be suffering from a severe draught. He wheezed, he slumped and generally wrapped his thin little suit around his round little shoulders. I know from experience (actually I do not, but I can imagine) that airplane hangars are extremely draughty. I have read enough Alexander Dumas novels to realize the signs of consumption, and even though it has been erradicated one cannot be too careful. There is nothing like a mandated stay in a Swiss sanitorium to ruin one\u2019s presidential ambitions.<br><br>Reccomendation: Buy a flannel waist coat.<br><br>Mitt Romney<br><br>Mitt Romney, on the other hand, is really tan. His is a tan not found in nature. It is a tan that I, in fact, most recently saw Paris Hilton sporting at the premiere of her new film \u201cThe Hottie and the Nottie.\u201d It is, in short, not real, and it needs to stop immediately. Though his suits are the best of anyone\u2019s, orange is a color that goes with nothing, except for orange, a lesson that all of us have learned through Halloween.<br><br>Reccomendation: Buy orange suits or stop the madness.<br><br>Barack Obama<br><br>There is a scene in \u201cMr. Smith Goes to Washington\u201d where Jimmy Stewart storms the Senate and yells about some injustice while wearing the loosest suit imaginable. I wonder if that is what Barack Obama is going for. His jackets are gigantic. His pants flap in the wind.  I realize he is skinny and has more important things on his mind or whatever, but considering that Michelle Obama is the best dressed at any of these functions, she probably understands the value of good tailoring. I don\u2019t really understand why she isn\u2019t sharing that knowledge with her husband.  <br><br>Recomendation: Go to Italy. By the time I left Italy, I was wearing hot pink spandex rompers and thinking they were too loose.<br><br>Hillary Clinton<br><br>As the only woman in the bunch, I was most interested in Hillary\u2019s fashion choices, and I will say this for her: I have no idea where she gets those pants suits. I have never ever seen them in any store. Horrific hip-length jacket with ankle-skimming capri pants in matching puke brown is a combination I literally thought was impossible to buy. My mother helpfully suggested that Hillary is in the shape of a perfect pear, and thus, it is impossible to buy anything except a hip length jacket. This may be true. <br><br>I also realize that she is trying to be taken seriously by an all-male establishment that only likes her when she cries. But I second my idol Anna Wintour when she says: \u201cThe notion that a contemporary woman must look mannish in order to be taken seriously as a seeker of power is frankly dismaying.\u201d Just because Bill happens to embody all your goals and dreams doesn\u2019t mean you have to dress like him. An A-line skirt hides a multitude of sins.  <br><br>Recommendation: Oh...I don\u2019t even know.<br><br>\u2014Columnist Rebecca M.

{"title": "Red, White, and Blue | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>\u201cAnd can we count on your support for Barack Obama for President?\u201d<br><br>I\u2019ve spoken those words hundreds of times now, and among the few undecided voters left, the reaction is always the same. First, their eyebrows furrow. Their shoulders shrink imperceptibly. And then a thin-lipped smile settles across their faces like a mask snapping into place. \u201cStill undecided,\u201d they\u2019ll say. Or, \u201cNot sure yet.\u201d Or, when I\u2019m really lucky, they\u2019ll be honest\u2014as honest as they know how to be.<br><br>\u201cI\u2019m not voting for no Muslim,\u201d they\u2019ll say. \u201cHe\u2019s not really a Muslim, you know,\u201d I\u2019ll begin, but they\u2019ve already closed the screen door in my face.<br><br>Welcome to Levittown, Pennsylvania, where every third house proudly bears an American flag, where \u201cpeople are hurting,\u201d but never so much that their front porches are not aggressively decorated for Halloween at least three weeks in advance, and where a solid majority of registered Democrats could never really support Barack Obama, at least not in public, at least not where the neighbors can hear.<br><br>Last weekend, I joined the Harvard College Democrats on their canvassing trip to this relic of Americana. For two days, we knocked the doors of the people that were once Hillary Clinton\u2019s base. They are the new swing vote, for a reason that all but the most jaded political hands should find troubling: many of them, quite simply, are racists.<br><br>Rep. John Murtha, a sixteen-term Congressman from Pittsburgh, acknowledged this reality on Wednesday with a bluntness that a less secure incumbent could never have dared. \u201cThere is no question that western Pennsylvania is a racist area,\u201d he said. I am afraid that in small towns on the Jersey border, there is no question, either.<br><br>The racism that defines these swing voters is not necessarily founded upon stereotype or prejudice. It\u2019s not the kind that claims that black kids are good at basketball, brown kids are good at math, and white kids are good at running the country. In this day and age, most of us have declared those statements unacceptable. And, in this case, they are groundless: I won\u2019t list what stereotypes exist for young black men, but Obama, a law professor and family man, clearly does not fit the mold.<br><br>In this election, racism has taken another turn: as bad, and maybe worse. In Europe, it once taught that Jews were not to be trusted. Now, in Levittown, it implies that every Muslim is a terrorist. In its softer form, this racism cautions us to stick with our own\u2014that identity outweighs both class and convictions. One woman I met worried that Obama would leverage the presidency against whites. \u201cIt\u2019s the reckoning,\u201d she said simply.<br><br>The racism of fear is subtler and more insidious than the kind of our past. It thrives on silence and political correctness\u2014on the avoidance of the race issue at all costs, and on our willingness to pretend it is something else entirely. And it festers, for that reason, among the middle-class voters who have lost almost everything\u2014jobs, savings, homes\u2014and who are loathe to gamble on a candidate whose entire campaign is based on change, when change is destroying them.<br><br>Hillary understood Levittown. She pandered to it with duck-shooting faux Rust Belt authenticity, but also with tangible proposals for health care, energy, and job creation. And if she offended us when she argued that \u201cObama will have trouble appealing to white voters,\u201d  she was, unfortunately, exactly right. It has become increasingly clear that John McCain understands this reality, too: with his characterization of Obama as \u201cdangerous,\u201d in Governor Sarah Palin\u2019s comment that he was \u201cpallin\u2019 around with terrorists,\u201d and in the blind and righteous fury of supporters at campaign rallies: \u201cKill him!\u201d<br><br>These are not appeals to sense, but to fear. And to them, the Obama campaign\u2019s strategy of keeping the race issue quiet is, in many ways, exactly wrong. True, he\u2019s leading in all polls; true, enough middle-class whites will swing his way. Some will do it because they prefer his populist economic policies. Others will shrug, close their eyes, and vote the party line.<br><br>Pundits will credit his inevitable victory to youth, African-Americans, and urbanites, and they will be right: Working-class whites are no longer the Democratic base, and if population demographics continue to shift, their support may no longer be crucial for victory. But if we are to hope for a \u201cnew politics,\u201d isn\u2019t that beyond the point? In other words: is an Obama victory a progressive victory at all if he is shunned by the very middle class he is trying to rescue?<br><br>Bigotry does not disappear overnight, and Obama\u2019s best chance to win over middle America will come after his inauguration. If we\u2019re lucky, he will prove himself to be as measured and reasonable a president as he has been a candidate. And perhaps experience will convince the good people of Levittown what I could not: that, despite his skin color and his Harvard education, \u201cthe Muslim\u201d understands them, too.<br><br><br><br>Elise Liu \u201911, a Crimson editorial writer, lives in Cabot House.

{"title": "The Sound of Silence | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Last week, at a meeting on the Republican campaign trail, a white woman in the audience voiced her concerns about Obama. \u201cI have read about him,\u201d she explaining, pointing out that \u201che\u2019s an Arab.\u201d Though McCain was quick to correct her, his response was curious: \u201cNo, ma\u2019am, he\u2019s a decent family man and citizen that I just happen to have disagreements with over fundamental issues.\u201d Somehow, \u201cfamily man\u201d and \u201cArab\u201d came across as mutually exclusive concepts. The audience didn\u2019t seem to notice\u2014it followed the remark with a hearty round of applause.\n<br><br>This implication that there is something innately sinister or undesirable about Arabs, and by extension Islam (to those leveling them, the \u201cepithets\u201d of \u201cArab\u201d and \u201cMuslim\u201d are synonymous) is, unfortunately, nothing new. For all its promises of change, hope, and inclusiveness, this campaign year has been shot through with a surprisingly virulent strain of prejudice and intolerance. The combination of anti-Arabic tensions arising from our nation\u2019s war in the Middle East and a presidential candidate with a \u201cterrorist\u201d name has lent itself to a mushroom cloud of anti-Islamic sentiment, sanctioned by an unquestioning public.\n<br><br>The issue is non-partisan. While trumpeting its candidate\u2019s multicultural background and commitment to every social class, the Obama campaign has also taken pains to distance itself from Islam in an attempt to appeal to voters on the fence. A page of its \u201cFight the Smears\u201d Web site, entitled \u201cThe Truth About Obama\u2019s Faith,\u201d for example, states that \u201cshameful, shadowy attackers have been lying about Barack\u2019s religion, claiming he is a Muslim instead of a committed Christian.\u201d That this rhetoric both contrasts committed Christianity with Islam and draws a mental association between Obama\u2019s \u201cshameful, shadowy\u201d opponents and Muslims is no accident. \n<br><br>On another occasion, in response to allegations that he secretly practices Islam, Obama retorted: \u201cLet\u2019s make clear what the facts are: I am a Christian. I have been sworn in with a Bible...I lead the pledge of allegiance sometimes in the United States Senate when I\u2019m presiding.\u201d The question did not have anything to do with the pledge of allegiance; to even raise the topic sustains the false opposition between Islam on the one hand and patriotism on the other.\n<br><br> All of this puts Obama-supporting Muslims in a tight spot. As the election draws near, many have adopted a \u201cwait-and-see\u201d policy: They hold off on doing anything that might provide more fuel for his detractors, yet secretly hope for his acknowledgement. \u201cA lot of us are waiting for him to say that there\u2019s nothing wrong with being a Muslim,\u201d admitted Rep. Keith Ellison, the country\u2019s first Muslim congressman, in July.\n<br><br>The political climate thus far makes it unlikely that the Obama campaign will directly acknowledge the legitimacy of Islam and the Muslim vote, at least not anytime before Nov. 5. Part of this has to do with the 13 percent of independent voters who believe that Obama is a Muslim; as long as the possibility exists that this perception will jeopardize his chance of winning undecided votes, Obama\u2019s campaign will prioritize disabling the rumor mill over dismantling religious stereotypes.\n<br><br>The other motive for keeping mum has to do with the simplistic and largely negative characterization of Islam and the Arab world post-9/11, to which the government itself must plead guilty. Though few have gone as far as televangelist Pat Robertson, who called the prophet Muhammad \u201can absolute wild-eyed fanatic\u2026a killer,\u201d or Fox News personality Sean Hannity, who compared the Quran to Mein Kampf, the idea persists that there is something possibly threatening, and definitely unsettling, about Islam.\n<br><br>Correcting public misconceptions is certainly a worthy goal\u2014it is important that voters are informed about the person for whom they cast their ballots. But if the process of debunking entails alienating and even implicitly vilifying part of the population, it is time to reconsider one\u2019s tactics. In his rush to get the \u201cfacts\u201d straight, Obama, along with McCain and the media, has only reinforced the infuriating notion that Muslims are something less than true Americans. This election has been a celebration of diversity on issues of race, gender, and geography\u2014why not religion?\n<br><br>\n<br><br>Jessica A.

Spiegelman, the politically active artist best known for his creation of \u201cMaus,\u201d a graphic novel based on his father\u2019s experiences in a concentration camp, has just released \u201cBreakdowns: Portrait of the Artist as a Young %@&amp;*!,\u201d composed of both previously released comics from the 70s and new work exploring their development. The new work investigates comics as a medium and its effect on Spiegelman\u2019s life. <br><br><br><br>The Harvard Crimson: What made comics your chosen medium for self-expression? <br><br><br><br>Art Spiegelman: You know those science experiments with little ducklings that just follow the first thing they see around? The first thing I was able to really see and understand was comics. <br><br><br><br>THC: How does the narrative element influence your visual aesthetic? <br><br><br><br>AS: I find that I draw appropriate to each idea rather than try to draw the same way each time. The drawings keep echoing different approaches and different styles depending on the content. In the new book \u201cBreakdowns\u201d each strip is drawn in a different way. Some of them are drawn looking expressionist. Some of them are drawn with some kind of simple-minded Lulu style. <br><br><br><br>THC: Why did you think it was necessary to reprint the original 1978 \u201cBreakdowns\u201d? <br><br><br><br>AS: My publisher offered me a chance to have it come out again, and I was delighted just because I didn\u2019t quite think it was possible. Since the work actually had an impact on me and other comics that came after it seemed appropriate to let it become part of what can be available and seen again. I was proud when I made it and now I\u2019m far enough away from it to be proud of it again. <br><br><br><br>THC: How is your work influenced by other art forms? <br><br><br><br>AS: On one hand it\u2019s possible to say that I\u2019m influenced by everything from Rice Krispies package backs to Beckett. Like most artists, anything\u2014all the different ways of making a thought or feeling manifest that you can re-translate for oneself. There\u2019s a certain moment when 20th-century painting became very important to me as something that I was trying to think about and see how it could be applied to comics. The same thing was true of some writers ranging from Kafka to Joyce to Gertrude Stein who were actually very important to me at the period I was making \u201cBreakdowns.\u201d When I\u2019m trying to evoke a certain mood I\u2019ll put on something like Eric Dolphy or Erik Satie. I think film is an interesting cousin to comics\u2014and it\u2019s dangerous to think of comics as storyboards\u2014but inevitably some kinds of silent movie story-telling, noir film and non-narrative film that were beginning to be exposed during the period of the \u201cBreakdowns\u201d stuff all had a major impact on how I was thinking. <br><br><br><br>THC: The title of your most recent publications is \u201cBreakdowns: Portrait of the Artist as a Young\u201d...what I can only assume is \u201cfuck,\u201d but....  <br><br><br><br>AS: What I like about that word is that it\u2019s a word that only exists in comics. It can\u2019t be spoken in English. <br><br><br><br>THC: Do you think there\u2019s a language for comics that\u2019s different from prose or poetry?<br><br><br><br>AS: Absolutely. The real subject of \u201cBreakdowns\u201d ultimately is entering you into the thought process that only comics make available, because I think comics echo the way the brain works. <br><br><br><br>THC: How so?<br><br><br><br>AS: We think in short bursts of language. We think in iconic cartoon imagery. A baby can recognize a \u201cHave a nice day\u201d smiley face before it can recognize its mother\u2019s smile, so we\u2019re hardwired to understand cartoon imagery. And the juxtaposition of panels automatically brings up notions of memory and of how time flows; you\u2019re always looking backwards, forwards, and in the present, and that\u2019s exactly how the mind slithers around. <br><br><br><br>THC: You faced difficulty getting \u201cIn the Shadow of No Towers,\u201d a collection concerning 9/11, published. What role does censorship play in the creation of your work?<br><br><br><br>AS: It mainly exists in the interface between me and the publication, but I\u2019m in the luxurious position of having fewer constraints than a cartoonist who would be married to magazine or a newspaper. When I was working on the \u201cNo Towers\u201d pages, nobody in America wanted that because it was at a time when criticism of the government was looked at as a treasonous act, almost. It has changed happily and radically since, but in 2002 that work didn\u2019t have a logical home except in Europe. With the \u201cBreakdowns\u201d book, one of the reasons I didn\u2019t think it was going to be able to be published again was the hardcore sexual imagery. Now I\u2019m told, \u201cWell that\u2019s not a problem.\u201d <br><br><br><br>THC: You\u2019ve been a politically engaged artist, publicly speaking against George W. Bush and criticizing the media for its widespread conformism. What in your view is the role of the artist as we grapple with a failing economy and an upcoming election? <br><br><br><br>AS: I never wanted to be a political cartoonist per se. I just found myself caught up in the undertow and wanting to engage, especially when I don\u2019t feel engagement is coming from elsewhere. Right now we\u2019re living in a very healthy moment for artists actually screaming about what has to happen. Some pictures which might seem counterintuitive have been very helpful toward the upcoming election. I look at that New Yorker Obama cover as having had a big part in undoing the calumnies and bullshit that has been surrounding poor Barack\u2019s middle name. As we move toward Great Depression Two, the roles will be up to the artist. Some people will just take on the job of being distracter and entertainer, and others will try to keep their eye on the ball and do incisive images. <br><br><br><br>THC: Which will you be?<br><br><br><br>AS: It depends on the given day of the week, whether I\u2019m feeling angry or introspective.

By contrast, IOP polling in the fall of 2006 found that 60 percent believed in politics as a way of problem-solving. <br><br>IOP Director Bill P. Purcell said that the poll also observed a continued level of high support among American youth for public service. <br><br>\u201cThere\u2019s a significant change in the belief of young people that the government can make a difference, that politics can produce results, and that it matters to them,\u201d the former Nashville mayor said. \u201cWe had many indications of this at the IOP and Phillips Brooks House, but this poll indicates that from one side of America to the other, this generation of young people is ready to be involved and ready to lead.\u201d <br><br>The survey also found that nearly six in 10 respondents are interested in solving the nation\u2019s most pressing challenges by entering public service. That sentiment was consistent across party lines, with 68 percent of Democrats and 63 percent of Republicans saying they wanted to participate in service. <br><br>Economic woes continue to rank as the nation\u2019s most pressing issue in the minds of respondents. More than half of the young people surveyed said that the economy was their top concern, while the war in Iraq came in second place with nine percent. <br><br>In terms of the candidates, Barack Obama holds an almost two-to-one lead over John McCain among young voters. <br><br>Sarah Palin has proved to be the more volatile of the two vice-presidential candidates, with 40 percent saying that the choice made them less likely to support the Republican ticket. Twenty-five percent said that McCain\u2019s choice of Palin made them more likely to vote for the Arizona senator. On the other hand, 60 percent of those surveyed said that Obama\u2019s choice of Joe Biden made no difference in their voting behavior. <br><br>The poll also found that 26 percent of young people most wanted the next president to be like Bill Clinton, while 11 percent selected Ronald Reagan. <br><br>\u201cYoung people want a president like Clinton because, a) they remember him, and b) they remember that his administration was a time of prosperity in America,\u201d said IOP Director of Polling John Della Volpe. \u201cMost importantly, our nation was respected in the world.\u201d <br><br>Purcell also noted that the survey showed potential for young people to take a more active role in politics, and said that the IOP would be sure to reach out to Harvard students in future years. <br><br>\u201cFor us, like the next president, the most important thing is that we act upon this interest and make sure that there are opportunities and avenues for this excitement and involvement to be meaningful,\u201d Purcell said. <br><br>\u2014Staff Writer Prateek Kumar can be reached at kumar@fas.harvard.edu.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Hussein on Trial | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Entering the endgame of a presidential election, gloves come off and campaigns often resort to less-than-honorable tactics to energize supports or sow doubt among an opponent\u2019s potential voters. The McCain-Palin ticket has epitomized this fourth-quarter retreat into murky tactics, for example, with its use of Barack Obama\u2019s middle name, Hussein, as political ammunition. Appealing to the worst of voters\u2019 prejudices, such tactics are particularly fiendish for their ability to degrade even those who speak out against them.\r<br><br>A friend of mine, stalwart of the Republican information network that he is, regularly forwards to me chain letters that proclaim themselves revelations, bringing real Americans the news withheld by the sinister liberal media. Several of these letters have seized upon the apparently shocking fact that Senator Obama\u2019s middle name is a name common in the Middle East\u2014among Muslims! \r<br><br>These letters, of course, appeal only to those willing to inhale alarmist propaganda without a moment\u2019s worth of fact-checking. Yet the true disappointing consequence of these outlandish suggestions is that the defenders of Obama\u2019s good name unwittingly dig in to positions they should never have taken. To defend Obama as John McCain did\u2014as not an Arab, but a \u201cgood family man\u201d\u2014is to concede that Muslim heritage is somehow intrinsically disturbing.\r<br><br>The notion of fighting over whether someone is or is not Muslim seems especially preposterous against the backdrop of chaos and crisis gripping Turkey right now over a terrorism trial unprecedented in its scale. Turkey may seem exotic and far removed from the American collective consciousness with Nov. 4 fast approaching, but the long-term importance of this crisis over Muslim identity cannot be dismissed. On Monday, the first court session of this trial had to adjourn because of the crush of people in the courtroom as protesters thronged Silivri prison-court. \r<br><br>Tensions are high in Turkey, not because of empty political wrangling, but rather because dozens of prominent Turkish men, including former top army officers, face charges for planning alleged attacks and assassinations to destabilize the Turkish state. Government prosecutors have accused the men of comprising the Ergenekon group, a secret network allegedly so sinister it had composed a menu of targets to be eliminated as part of a plan to give the army a pretense to take over the government. \r<br><br>Americans should follow this trial not because its details sound lifted from the next James Bond film, but rather because its intrigues do resemble a higher-stakes version of our own party politics. What makes this case pertinent is that those prosecuting the group have been accused of representing the pro-Islam government, the ruling AK Party, in revenge for a failed court attempt to ban the party this summer for undermining Turkey\u2019s secular government system.  For years, secular Turks have battled more Islamic Turks over the direction of their country. \r<br><br>The result of this case and any cases that follow could very well dictate the long-term direction of the Turkish state. With a large military and ambition to join the European Union, a rebound and triumph of secularism, or the rise of an increasingly Islamic agenda could have ramifications extending across Europe and even back home to the United States, where the political discourse revolves around anti-Islamic name-calling.\r<br><br>With our election at hand, Americans should look to Turkey. We need to realize that when these campaigns end, we must move beyond  politics of insinuation and inertia. In the rest of the world,  the stakes are much higher.\r<br><br> <br><br>Alexander R.

{"title": "Presidentiality | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>If you were one of the estimated 56.5 million people who tuned in to the final presidential debate on Oct. 15, you witnessed a contentious heavyweight fight. This debate will be remembered not only for the candidates\u2019 clashes of ideology, but also for clashes of style. A quick read of the transcript would give the impression that John McCain\u2019s aggression delivered him a much needed primetime victory. Nevertheless, the most reputable polls still show Barack Obama with a commanding and implacable lead. This is because although McCain was fiery and fierce, the American presidency is not a debate tournament trophy, but a show of faith from American voters that they believe in the president\u2019s leadership. Simply put, Obama looked more \u201cpresidential\u201d than McCain.<br><br>How can John McCain\u2014war hero, statesmen, four-term senator\u2014not look presidential? Despite preconceptions, McCain managed to pull off exactly that. Before the debate, McCain claimed he would \u201cwhip [Obama\u2019s] you-know-what.\u201d  This is an odd thing to hear from a candidate who criticized Obama\u2019s promise to meet with foreign leaders without pre-conditions by proclaiming, \u201cYou don\u2019t say that out loud.\u201d  Similarly, Mr. McCain, \u201cwhip his you-know-what\u201d is not something that a president would say. Not only is it vulgar, but it also conveys the wrong message about American hegemony. The American president is exceptional; he, or she, is supposed to have the advantage. Like my football coach used to say, \u201cact like you\u2019ve been there.\u201d<br><br>In the actual debate McCain exhibited the same uncontrolled behavior. While he battled hard, Obama remained cool and reserved. For instance, McCain looked rather emotional when describing John Lewis\u2019s racial remarks about his rallies. McCain complained, \u201cThat, to me, was so hurtful.\u201d  Obama took the tough Reagan-like stance: \u201cI think the American people are less interested in our hurt feelings during the course of the campaign than addressing the issues that matter to them so deeply.\u201d  As if to add some credibility to that statement, while barely changing his posture, Obama offered the counterexample of people at McCain\u2019s rallies who have chanted, \u201cKill him.\u201d Americans do not want a weak president who bellyaches about how hurt he or she was by an attack ad, especially in the middle of a three-front war on terrorism, in Iraq, Afghanistan, and around the globe\u2014not to mention the financial crisis.<br><br>Of course, McCain had great moments in the 90 minute debate. After being criticized for Republican policies, McCain told Obama, \u201cI am not President Bush. If you wanted to run against President Bush, you should have run four years ago.\u201d  Even though Obama has demonstrated an aptitude to think on his feet, he simply did not have a comeback for this zinger. It is worth noting that the studio audience, which was supposed to remain absolutely silent, exclaimed and gasped at the line.  Those watching could even see a look of glory in McCain\u2019s eyes\u2014the look a major league batter gets when he knows by the feel of the baseball hitting the bat that he just hit  a home run. It was a victory, but McCain\u2019s zinger was just as short-lived as a home run. The debate moved on, the topics changed, and the one-liner became a soundbyte, not a game-changer.<br><br>Joe the Plumber was also a good move. McCain was able to take a confusing argument about Obama\u2019s tax plan and make it resonate in the age of the ten-second soundbyte. Although most Americans do not make $250,000 a year, many Americans aspire to do so. Thus, most are not excited to be burdened with extra taxes when they get there. Furthermore, McCain argued, if small businesses have their taxes increased, then those who work for small businesses or consume small businesses products are affected by lower wages and higher prices. This line of reasoning was conveyed effectively by McCain\u2019s Joe the Plumber reference, as well as Joe Wurzelbacher\u2019s YouTube clip and subsequent televisions appearances. <br><br>Beyond these two debate points, Obama handled McCain\u2019s barbs decently. He deftly brushed aside the claim McCain made that Obama had befriended domestic terrorist Bill Ayers by reminding McCain that Ayers\u2019s attacks occurred 40 years ago, when Obama was eight years old. Furthermore, the extent of their relationship was merely that they both served \u201con a school reform board funded by one of Ronald Reagan\u2019s former ambassadors and close friends, [Walter] Annenberg. Other members on that board were the presidents of the University of Illinois, the president of Northwestern University, who happens to be a Republican, the president of The Chicago Tribune, a Republican-leaning newspaper.\u201d  Obama also expertly defended his partial birth abortion voting record by explaining that there was no clause in the bill allowing  protection of the mother\u2019s health.<br><br>There is more to a debate than what is verbally communicated. Physical communication and eloquence, are also very important. Obama spoke with a water-faucet flow, flashing his gleaming smile intermittently. McCain\u2019s speech had the flow of a traffic jam in a snow storm, as he confused syntax and became short of breath. This stuff matters. McCain argued like he was down in the polls. On the other hand, you could almost see Obama thinking the line that made Reagan famous: \u201cThere you go again.\u201d <br><br>Running for the American presidency is unlike any other job and its application process is accordingly unique. On Nov. 4, America will not just elect talking points, ten-part plans, and clever soundbytes, but a leader with the vision to set the tone for America both at home and abroad. Although McCain did a decent job on the technical criteria, he had woefully inadequate forethought. A president can always hire brilliant advisers to set policy, but when it comes to leadership the buck stops here. <br><br><br><br>George Hayward \u201911, a Crimson editorial writer, is a government concentrator in Currier House.

{"title": "New Book Not Hot or Original | Arts | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The title of Thomas Friedman\u2019s latest book, \u201cHot, Flat, and Crowded: Why We Need a Green Revolution and How It Can Renew America\u201d recycles the title of his earlier bestseller, \u201cThe World is Flat.\u201d Unfortunately, the rest of the material also seems reused.    <br><br>Friedman\u2019s fifth book attempts a rousing reveille to the Energy Climate Era, where global warming,  world-wide middle class expansion, and population growth led to the titular characteristics: hot, flat, and crowded. The book tells a five-part story, \u00e0 la Shakespeare, but it\u2019s clear that the author neglected to borrow from the literary greats the necessary ingredients of creativity, sophistication, and substance. Reading the book means slogging through a wearing morass of self-aggrandizing anecdotes, utopian musings, and kitschy catchphrases, none used more liberally than \u201chot, flat, and crowded,\u201d which appears in Friedman\u2019s sermon so many times that it could give  John McCain\u2019s \u201cmaverick\u201d a run for its money in the race of overuse. <br><br>And, while the world may actually be as hot, flat, and crowded as the Minnesota State Fair, Friedman\u2019s readership should be forewarned that his latest book is not hot (in the Paris Hilton sense of the word), that it\u2019s uneven, and that it\u2019s empty. <br><br>Friedman\u2019s argument is ice cold because his call-to-arms is rather unoriginal, as is the way he argues it. His thesis is something we\u2019ve heard many times before: \u201ceverybody, in time, is going to be forced to pay the true cost of the energy they are using, the true cost of the climate change they are causing, the true cost of the biodiversity loss they are triggering, the true cost of the petrodictatorship they are funding, and the true cost of the energy poverty they are sustaining... The ability to develop clean power and energy-efficient technologies is going to become the defining measure of a country\u2019s economic standing.\u201d This argument may be forward-looking, but it has already gone mainstream. If Friedman is trying to become the Energy Climate Era\u2019s Rachel Carson, Garrett Hardin, and Thomas Malthus all in one, he seems to have forgotten that figureheads like Al Gore have already made his arguments accessible to the masses and, perhaps, in an even more appealing fashion. <br><br>Friedman\u2019s knowledge of the science behind a hot, flat, and crowded world is relatively deep, and he expresses moving concern about America\u2019s role in fostering responsible economic growth in emerging markets. But all of this becomes diluted in Friedman\u2019s attempt to make his message user-friendly. His chapters feature a preponderance of italicized, monosyllabic words, saccharine metaphors (\u201cwe are all sailing on the Mayflower anew\u201d) and a cut-and-paste frenzy of recent news articles that make some of the chapters read like a LexisNexis power search. <br><br>The book is uneven because it is riddled with hypocrisies about how to confront the problems we face in an Energy Climate Era. Friedman creates unanswered contradictions between surburbanization and urbanization, market incentives and government incentives, constructivism and neoliberalism, and protectionism and multilateralism. Even his metaphors contradict one another. At one point he says that the solution is \u201ca million Noahs in a million arks,\u201d and yet, throughout the book, he\u2019s asking his readership to acknowledge that we are all in the same boat.<br><br>Friedman\u2019s argument is empty because his finest points become obscured by abstract digressions that don\u2019t project a clear message of how to find solutions. He has an impressively broad perspective on the state of global development and makes a compelling argument that America\u2019s economic well-being and global standing depend on investing more in energy leadership. He also draws attention to the implications of energy poverty in emerging markets and the potential power of nations who control supply. But he only provides two, broad suggestions to households: lead a personally sustainable life (Friedman, incidentally, lives in an 11,400 square-foot home) and work to change national leadership. On this latter point, Friedman argues the obvious, that we need innovation, clear leadership signals, and fully-functioning markets, but fails to truly discuss the political process that can get us there. Furthermore, his more interesting observations are discredited by silly chapter titles such as \u201cWe\u2019re Not in Kansas Anymore\u201d and a 12-page utopian foray into a dream-world where politicians win elections with the slogan, \u201cPrice the road, clear the traffic.\u201d<br><br>Friedman\u2019s book is an essentially painless read, because the picture he paints of a hot, flat, and crowded world is a vivid one, but his call to action is ultimately uninspiring because it isn\u2019t fresh. The title of one chapter, \u201cThe really scary stuff we already know,\u201d would have been better suited on the cover than on page 117.<br><br>\u2014Staff writer Erin F.

Mostly, I envy you because you thought Aaron Tippin\u2019s \u201cDrill Here Drill Now\u201d was a great song, something I may never be able to do.\r\n<br><br>But we need to talk, Joe. Remember how you were the centerpiece of this election only a couple of weeks back, when Sarah Palin was actually winking at you? Those were good times, but now it seems that another Joe has usurped all the attention.\r\n<br><br>Did you know that \u201cPlumber\u201d isn\u2019t even the guy\u2019s last name? He\u2019s not even licensed,  doggone it! And his real surname is Wurzelbacher.  Now Joe, doesn\u2019t that sound like some kind of Arab Communist name to you? I know it does to me. So why the heck is the GOP, our GOP, suddenly so keen on this guy?\r\n<br><br>I guess it\u2019s because they don\u2019t care about us anymore. I\u2019m no socialist Joe, but it would be nice if my job wouldn\u2019t get shipped off to China or if someone could stand up to those Wall Street types. It would be great if I could get a raise, or keep my health insurance instead of crossing state lines looking for a new one. Heck, with these gas prices I wouldn\u2019t cross state lines for cheap booze. And you have to read all these pages of fine print to buy insurance. Page upon page of reading\u2014that isn\u2019t American Joe!\r\n<br><br>But the real issue here is that Sarah\u2019s left you for Joe the Plumber. And that\u2019s because she\u2019s a maverick, and like all mavericks she\u2019ll do exactly whatever the polls tell her to do. Palin winked at you and now she\u2019s smiling at Joe the Plumber, but really they\u2019re all just waiting for Joe the Banker to get better.\r\n<br><br>Now don\u2019t cry Joe. I know it\u2019s sad that Sarah Palin played you like that, but as you crack open your seventh Bud let me ask you this: have you thought of getting revenge? Let\u2019s vote for Obama, Joe. Not because of that universal healthcare nonsense; I know we\u2019ll never get sick too. Not even for human rights or a more inclusive foreign policy; I\u2019m not sure what those things mean either. Let\u2019s vote for him just to get back at McCain and Palin.\r\n<br><br>Now I know you\u2019re worried Mr. Sixpack, but I\u2019m here to clear up all these misconceptions about Obama. Does he kill babies? No Joe, he hunts them, and dang it Joe if you say you\u2019re against hunting I don\u2019t think I can call you an American. Is he going to raise your taxes? No, but he might raise Sarah Palin\u2019s!  Did Obama pal around with domestic terrorists? Maybe when he was young, but that just shows what a tough kid he was. Is he black? Can you even see in color after eleven beers?\r\n<br><br>I guess I can now count on your revenge vote for Barack Obama, Mr. Sixpack? I\u2019ll have to get going then, because ACORN pays me according to number of registrations. I\u2019ll probably put in your name twice; it\u2019s not like anyone reads these things anyway. But remember sir, now that Sarah\u2019s winking at Joe the Plumber, we\u2019re going to show her who is boss on November 4th, right? Joe? \r\n<br><br>Joe?\r\n<br><br>Bartender, did he actually empty all those cans? What a patriot!\r\n<br><br>\n<br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Rajarshi Banerjee \u201811 lives in Currier House.  His column appears on alternate Tuesdays</span></span></p>"}

It trumpets the glory of an autumn day spent pursuing the hides of harts and the hearts of women\u2014sometimes both at once. It is a piece of extraordinary vigor that makes one understand why John McCain would choose a backwoods Alaskan huntress as his running mate. <br><br>Or at least it should do all of this.<br><br>But in Opera Boston\u2019s underwhelming new production, playing Oct. 17-21 at Boston\u2019s opulently beautiful Cutler Majestic Theatre, the orchestra fails to transmit the Romantic power of Weber\u2019s music. The musicians, under the baton of Gil Rose, played with confounding restraint, not giving the fortissimo passages of the score their due fortitude. In the final minute of the overture, when the strings should be a band of sprinting hunters, they were instead a flock of pigeons flying languidly overhead. The absurd onstage pantomime that accompanied the music did not help matters, either.<br><br>The singers, like the pit, also suffered from want of robustness and intensity.  In a season-opener\u2014and with an opera that has not been performed in the Boston area for 25 years\u2014the performers should have been drunk from the first-night excitement. But most of them merely seemed hung-over.<br><br>Daniel Snyder, in the leading role of Max, sang with far more urgency than he acted. His movement and expression were often as wooden as the butt of his hunting rifle, which, for a character whose inner psychological turmoil is at the center of the opera, was not welcome. In the opera\u2019s plot, Max is a down-on-his-luck hunter who must win a shooting contest to gain his beloved Agathe\u2019s hand in marriage. Having performed disastrously in a lead-up competition, he turns to a shadowy pact with the Devil to make sure he shoots surely in the all-or-nothing finals. But Mr. Snyder, as well as singer Emily Pulley, who played a fretful and unlikable Agathe, does not act with enough conviction to make anyone really care whether his bullets will land. The bright-voiced and comical soprano Heather Buck, in the archetypal sassy-best-friend-to-the-leading-lady role, fared much better as \u00c4nnchen.<br><br>The vague and muted acting of most of the ensemble went hand in hand with the production\u2019s unfathomable setting. With \u201cDer Freisch\u00fctz,\u201d director Sam Helfrich presents a world that, like the acting, is never really sure what it\u2019s supposed to be. He puts Agathe in a traditional German dirndl while \u00c4nnchen, in the same scene, wears a form-fitting black blazer and a pair of department store jeans. The chorus of village maidens, bodices laced up and hair braided like so many St. Pauli Girls, drink lager out of disposable frat-party cups. A rustic wooden barrel that looks like it might have been used in the original 1821 production at the Konzerthaus in Berlin, shares space on the stage with a blue plastic trash bin that looks like it might have been purchased at the Home Depot in West Roxbury, Mass. The period and setting are never clear, producing an inscrutable operatic haze that frustrates singers and spectators alike.<br><br>The haze finally cleared\u2014though only briefly\u2014in the middle of the third and final act. As Buck was singing a humorous aria called \u201cEinst tr\u00e4umte meiner sel\u2019gen Base\u201d (\u201cMy late cousin once dreamed\u201d), an unexpected bang shot through the theatre. The overhead screen projecting the English translations of the sung German had gone blank, and would remain so for the rest of the performance.<br><br>The computer glitch proved providential for the opera\u2019s singers. One imagines the backstage panic: \u201cLook, folks, the supertitles are out! The audience will not know what\u2019s happening if you continue to move about like flannel-wearing robots at a sausage shop. You must act! Act, by Gott!\u201d And act they did. Under pressure and in undesirable circumstances, the singers began to gesture and express and emote as they hadn\u2019t done before, and, paradoxically, the story became easier to understand than it had been in the prior acts, when the audience had translations to guide them but no raw emotion to move them.  <br><br>If only more such happy disasters had come along to save this production from its inconsistent, passionless self.<br><br><br><br><br><br></span></p>"}

He drew on the Cuban Missile Crisis as a historical lesson for his argument, recalling that he received classified briefings as the events of the crisis unfolded because of his role on the House Foreign Services Committee\r\n<br><br>\u201cI made a decision then, that if I ever had an opportunity to reduce the nuclear dangers and raise the nuclear threshold...that I was going to try to do it,\u201d said Nunn, who added that the gravity of the situation carried over while he served in office. \r\n<br><br>Since leaving the Senate after the 2006 elections, Nunn has dedicated his career to the disarmament of nuclear weapons. \r\n<br><br>He is currently the co-chairman and CEO of the Nuclear Threat Initiative, an organization that tries to reduce the threat of nuclear weapons by analyzing threats and funding threat-reduction projects like the cleanup of nuclear material left in Belgrade.\r\n<br><br>The annual lecture was established thanks to a gift from the McNamara family, and the lecture is to be given by an individual \u201cseeking to illuminate key lessons from history for future policymakers seeking to avoid war and promote peace.\u201d\r\n<br><br>Audience members said they found the presentation compelling. \r\n<br><br>\u201cI thought of the most paramount points was that we continue to not talk first. We should sit down with Russia, China, India before taking action,\u201d said Benjamin T.

But this was truly a dream come true for me. I watch at least eight hours of TV a day in the summer anyway, so why not commute to New York to do it?\n<br><br>I interned in the video department at Gawker Media, working on the Gawker, Jezebel, Defamer, and other videos you watch to procrastinate. When we weren\u2019t working on a particular project (like a compilation of Obama/Osama slip-ups), I literally watched TV for eight hours straight\u2013\u2013waiting for the next wardrobe malfunction, news anchor melt-down, or embarrassing interview that would become the buzz on the blogosphere and email list fodder.\n<br><br>Naturally, I watched a lot of Fox News, even more of The View, and so much of The Hills that my imaginary frenemies are named Lo, Whitney, and Spencer.\n<br><br>This was my dream job not only because of the chance to work at Gawker (a site which any legit internet addict visits compulsively), but also because I consider myself a veritable TV connoisseur.

My sister and I use catchphrases from the short-lived The Famous Jett Jackson in everyday conversation. Two of my clearest memories are of that fateful day in second grade when my dad installed a satellite dish, just in time for the golden age of Snick, and then the day just last summer that catapulted The Lamb Family into the TiVo era.\n<br><br>When I got to Harvard, keeping up with my shows was harder, but with Hulu.com and a little hard work I make it work every week. I actually make schedules around being able to catch up on the shows I\u2019ve missed, and most of the time my favorite shows are a higher priority than homework.

The health care provider rolled out a strategic planning process early last month in an effort to deal with rising costs and diminishing funds. \n<br><br>The Health Alliance had already instituted a <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=522671\" target=\"_blank\">hiring freeze</a><a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=522671\"></a> and cut back on discretionary spending in February, and is now in the midst of laying off roughly 300 workers\u20149 percent of its workforce. \n<br><br>The Health Alliance\u2019s CEO Dennis D. Keefe met Friday with members of the state\u2019s administration, who confirmed that the state is reversing its commitment for certain funding this year, according to a letter he wrote to the community.\n<br><br>Keefe\u2019s letter stated that he has scheduled urgent meetings with various legislative leaders later this week to convey the serious nature of the cuts. \n<br><br>The Health Alliance isn\u2019t the only hospital system affected. Boston Medical Center will lose out on $64 million it had been expecting for care delivered to low-income Medicaid patients last fiscal year. \n<br><br>The Health Alliance\u2019s $40 million in cuts, when combined with other reductions in education and health care management, total almost $55 million\u2014more than 10 percent of its budget. Together the two hospital systems will bear roughly 20 percent of the administration\u2019s emergency cuts, according to Keefe\u2019s letter.  \n<br><br>\u201cI reiterated to the Patrick administration, and intend to tell the Legislative leaders, that cuts of this magnitude will require a draconian response,\u201d Keefe wrote. \u201cExactly what measures we will take in the face of this upsetting development are still being considered but we cannot wait long before we must act.\u201d \n<br><br>Keefe added that the news would not interfere with the strategic planning process slated to near completion in December.\n<br><br>As part of the strategic planning process, the hospital system will close the Oliver Farnum Senior Health Center in December, said Health Alliance spokesman Doug M. Bailey. Over the next three months, the health center will transfer its roughly 100 patients to other clinics. \n<br><br>Bailey repeated multiple times that the Health Alliance will not be \u201ccutting\u201d services, just \u201cremoving and consolidating\u201d them.\n<br><br>\u201cThere\u2019s a whole host of different things we could do, and I don\u2019t want to single out any right now,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cNone of it is pretty though.\u201d \n<br><br>A spokeswoman for the Mass. Office of Health and Human Services expressed support for local health care programs, but did not offer specifics on actions being taken to minimize the damage done by budget cuts.\n<br><br>Health Alliance officials blame much of their financial troubles on the state\u2019s 2006 health care reform program to lower the number of uninsured in the state, which also dropped the rate of reimbursement for hospitals providing uncompensated services.\n<br><br>Instead of full reimbursement, the hospital system now receives 60 to 70 cents for each dollar of uncompensated medical service provided, according to its chief financial officer Gordon H. Boudrow, Jr.\n<br><br>But advocates of the reform defended the plan, arguing that its costs could not have been predicted and in part reflect the program\u2019s success.\n<br><br>\u201cThe estimates were just that\u2014estimates,\u201d said Lynn Wickwire, a spokeswoman for Massachusetts Health Care For All, which strongly backed the measure. \u201cBecause the program has been so successful, 460,000 people have signed up [for health care]....As a result of that, it has cost more.\u201d \n<br><br>HCFA Research Director Brian Rosman echoed those sentiments, praising the governor for prioritizing health care reforms despite economic difficulties.\n<br><br>\u201cThere have been no cuts to eligibility under the new health reform programs, no cuts to any benefits,\u201d Rosman said.\n<br><br>But Rosman said providers would continue to suffer financially.\n<br><br>\u201cThere\u2019s certainly going to be substantial cuts to provider payments,\u201d he said. \n<br><br>Rosman said he felt optimistic about governmental support for health care reform, given recently approved federal support and the prospect of a similar program nationwide should Barack Obama win the White House, but Wickwire acknowledged that the economic climate might continue to hurt health care providers.\n<br><br>\u201cWhen there are cuts, the pain goes across the board,\u201d Wickwire said.

That doesn\u2019t make us more safe.\u201d\n<br><br>McCain, by contrast,  has backed \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell,\u201d saying at a forum in New York last year that he believes that the policy is currently \u201cworking.\u201d\n<br><br>\u201cRight now we\u2019ve got the best military we\u2019ve ever had\u2014the most professional, best trained, equipped and the bravest,\u201d McCain said in March 2007, according to The New York Times. \u201cAnd so I think it\u2019s logical to leave this issue alone.\u201d\n<br><br>By leaving \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d in place, a McCain presidency would almost certainly ensure that Harvard\u2019s legal struggle with the military would continues for at least four more years, while if Obama takes office on Jan. 20 and succeeds in rolling back the policy, Harvard would see its main reason for banning ROTC disappear.\n<br><br>Harvard and ROTC have had a frosty relationship since 1969, when ROTC was banned from campus after student protested the Vietnam War. Harvard students who currently participate in ROTC do so at MIT.\n<br><br>Thomas M.

Consequently, we support the Manhattan Federal District Court\u2019s recent ruling in favor of a New York City policy prohibiting public school teachers from wearing political paraphernalia in the classroom.\r<br><br>Teachers, like all other citizens, reserve the right to freedom of speech and expression. However, this liberty does not justify any behavior in the classroom, especially if it comes at the expense of students\u2019 best interests. Just like employees in any other sector, teachers are held to certain standards of conduct: A teacher cannot spend science classes expounding on the merits of creationism or turn a history period into an advertisement for Scientology while hiding behind the shield of free speech.\r<br><br>Similarly, a teacher should not be permitted to create a classroom climate that alienates certain students. While political buttons can be characterized as a benign form of self-identification, they also are inherently elements of proselytization. Buttons, which are primarily created by political campaigns for the purpose of rallying supporters, are designed to be seen and to elicit a specific response in others. This is particularly obvious with buttons containing imperative statements like \u201cVote McCain\u201d or more subtle statements like \u201cChange We Can Believe In.\u201d But even buttons that carry nothing more than a candidate\u2019s name send a clear message: \u201cI hold a certain set of political beliefs and you should, too.\u201d When they adorn the clothing of teachers\u2014who occupy positions of nearly unparalleled authority and influence in the lives of young students\u2014this effect is particularly powerful. It seems extremely likely that members of a political minority would feel uncomfortable expressing their views in a classroom controlled by a teacher who, quite literally, wears her politics on her sleeve.\r<br><br>It is in the pedagogical interest of our schools to have classrooms stay places where all students and ideas are tolerated. While banning buttons and posters will not bring an end to teacher bias, prohibiting teachers from dictating the political tenor of a class in this singularly blatant way is an important part of promoting a culture of neutrality.\r<br><br>This does not mean that public schools should be places devoid of dialogue and debate. Rather, educational institutions should do their best to foster discussion of important and topical themes, and the absence of political paraphernalia on teachers is a crucial part of creating genuine engagement with civic issues in the classroom.\r<br><br>The provision of public services should never be accompanied by partisan political messages, especially when those involved are young, impressionable children. A politically neutral classroom is an essential component of preserving the distinction between education and indoctrination, and is crucial in allowing students to enjoy real intellectual and political development.</span></p>"}

But democracies are set up with the intent that people will vote for the candidate that serves their interests, not the candidate most likely to win.<br><br>Admittedly, naysayers have a point about electability: A third-party candidate faces difficult odds in winning the next presidential election. However, a strong show of support for a particular third-party platform might compel the two major parties to incorporate elements of that platform into their own.<br><br>There is a strong historical precedent for exactly this scenario. Most recently, Ross Perot\u2019s popularity in 1992 (he won 18.9 percent of the popular vote) forced both parties to seriously address the ballooning national debt. For Perot, who had structured his campaign around its potential to \u201csend a message\u201d to incumbent parties rather than to win the presidency outright, this was a significant victory. <br><br>A hundred years earlier, the Populist Party\u2014which was the first to advocate a graduated income tax, direct election of Senators, and the eight-hour workday\u2014won almost 10 percent of the vote in the 1892 election. The Democrats were so shocked that in 1896 they claimed the former Populist candidate, William Jennings Bryan, for their own, after adopting the party\u2019s most attractive planks. The Republicans, who won that election, ultimately enacted many populist measures. The Populists lost the election, but their vision of America had been incorporated into the mainstream. <br><br>Even dyed-in-the-wool Democrats or Republicans sometimes stand to gain by voting for a third party. Because of the structure of the Electoral College, voting for Republicans in a blue state or Democrats in a red state is not likely to change the election. Why not draw attention to a specific issue by voting for the relevant third party instead?<br><br>No amount of heavy lifting will help the Republicans win California anytime soon, so a free-trade advocate would gain nothing by voting for them. However, if a critical mass of free-trade Republicans voted for the Libertarian Party, it would send a powerful message to both major parties that free-trade and non-interventionist foreign policy issues are important to voters.<br><br>Moreover, a strong showing in a given election cycle makes third parties much more viable in the next cycle thanks to federal funding. Since the 1970s, a party nominee who reaches the five percent threshold in the general election qualifies his party to receive federal funding for its candidates. Though federal funding may not be enough to keep pace with Clinton and Obama, it would easily be enough to make the Libertarian candidate a household name. <br><br>Part of the problem with building up confidence in third parties is that the two major parties have a stranglehold on the media, and it is in their self-interest to advance the view that third parties are not worth a rational person\u2019s time. Leading up to the 2000 election, Democrats chanted to would-be Green Party supporters the refrain that a vote for Ralph Nader was a vote for Bush. Losing the White House ingrained a powerful message in the consciousness of a certain group of environmental-leaning liberals: Your party hurts America, so either conform, or get out of politics. This likely contributed to the Green Party\u2019s decline in popularity since 2000. <br><br>What is troubling is that dwindling support for third parties feeds on itself. The choice not to waste a vote on a third party for fear that it will never win results is a self-fulfilling prophecy. It\u2019s like closing an account because of rumors that there will be a run on the bank.<br><br>This is a shame, because third-party issues are important to America. The two major parties have become so accustomed to framing the debate that they are deaf to viewpoints different from their own. Worse, mainstream America has come to understand issues according to narrow terms set by Democrats and Republicans. Vital issues that began as third-party agendas, such as nominating conventions, anti-slavery, or most recently, global warming, sometimes slip into public discourse. But the process is so slow and sporadic that legitimate concerns of Americans are too often ignored.<br><br>With the election nearly a year away, there is still time for third-party candidates to grow in popularity. A declaration of candidacy by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg would likely generate a groundswell of support. Though Bloomberg\u2019s prospects for winning as a third-party candidate are slim, there is still a chance for his candidacy to exert a powerful influence on the direction of the country, as long as enough people are willing to vote for him. <br><br>We are lucky enough to live in a democracy that gives us the right to vote for the candidate we most respect. It\u2019s time we started exercising that right.<br><br></span></p>"}
{"title": "Framing the Debate | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Not long ago, my blockmate\u2019s father asked me a seemingly simple question over dinner: why am I a Democrat? I momentarily\u2014and awkwardly\u2014fell silent, knowing that \u201cI guess I agree with most of their policies\u201d would be an insufficient response, particularly after he had just explained his faith-based conversion to the Right. There I was, unable to find a larger and more compelling reason for choosing my defining political affiliation.\n<br><br>Democrats\u2019 inability to articulate not only the minor policies they advocate, but also the major ideals that they represent\u2014or at least should represent\u2014has real and pernicious political and social consequences. The bumper-sticker talking points of modern Republican stump issues\u2014economic freedom, national security, family values\u2014have, for several years now, dominated our national discourse and so demanded that any new policy justify itself in conservative terms that are inherently hostile to a robust progressive agenda. \n<br><br>If Democrats are to undertake the governmental action necessary to deal with today\u2019s pressing issues\u2014a dire environmental crisis and staggering inequality at the forefront\u2014they need to develop a clear philosophical narrative that articulates the implicit reasoning behind their best policies and guides them toward better future policies. They must stop working within the Right\u2019s discourse and form their own narrative. Such a narrative can be found by looking back and trumpeting two ideals popularized by John  Dewey: effective liberty and pragmatism. \n<br><br>Refusing to accept the ideas of Enlightenment liberals such as John Locke \u201cas immutable truths good at all times and places,\u201d Dewey insisted that we instead conceive of liberty \u201cas something subject to historic relativity.\u201d \n<br><br>\u201cEffective liberty,\u201d he argued in his book \u201cLiberalism and Social Action,\u201d \u201cis a function of the social conditions existing at any time\u201d that \u201csignifies release from the impact of particular oppressive forces.\u201d\n<br><br>In both Dewey\u2019s time and ours, this means liberation from material insecurity, from economic coercion, and from cultural repression so that each individual can fully benefit from the teeming cultural and economic resources that too few in our nation enjoy. Formal liberty\u2014the legal constructs that conservatives subsume under the rhetoric of \u201cequality of opportunity\u201d\u2014thus becomes opposed to what Dewey called \u201ceffective liberty of thought and action.\u201d It is the latter that leads to an unchanging but endlessly adaptable ideal: granting each individual the autonomy to realize his capacities. \n<br><br>Effective liberty, then, depends not on the absolute laws of classical economics\u2014one of the most useful but most overused paradigms of sociopolitical thought\u2014but rather on a pragmatic approach that recognizes the complexity, nuance, and newness of each situation. \n<br><br>Democrats\u2014particularly young ones\u2014need to embrace this mantle, and embrace it fully, both following its precepts and arguing for them. As Dewey wrote in \u201cThe Public and Its Problems,\u201d \u201cThinking and beliefs should be experimental, not absolutistic.\u201d The basis for social policy then becomes not a matter of sound-byte ideals, but a matter of establishing concrete correlations of cause and effect that depend on the particular and complicated history of each problem.\n<br><br>This greater measure of argumentative complexity need not disempower or limit Democratic political discourse to elite technocrats. Rather, an emphasis on concreteness will facilitate a more robust and inclusive democracy that forces us to recognize that every voter\u2014and every human being\u2014has something to offer. \u201cThe man who wears the shoe knows best that it pinches and where it pinches,\u201d Dewey insisted, \u201ceven if the expert shoemaker is the best judge of how the trouble is to be remedied.\u201d\n<br><br>Democrats could thus offer not only alternative policies, but an alternative conception of political policy that challenges Republican ideals and creates an implicit counter-narrative defining the Republican Party as the party of dogmatism. And after seven years of George W. Bush, how many Americans find dogmatism appealing? A discourse of pragmatism and effective liberty would create a new set of criteria by which to judge policy. \n<br><br>Democrats thus face an opportunity. Recognizing that the President shapes not only policy, but the culture which enables that policy, Barack Obama has opened a space for a broad reconceptualization of our political process. If Democrats can follow his lead and fill this space by becoming the party of pragmatism and effective liberty, they may find themselves governing this nation\u2014and governing it well\u2014for several years to come.\n<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Patrick R.

{"title": "Romney's Immigration Hypocrisy | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>As the United States is a country that achieved greatness and prosperity thanks to incessant waves of immigrants from the five continents over a period of 500 years, it is hard to understand the xenophobic rhetoric of some presidential candidates, particularly in the Republican field.\n<br><br>The denunciation of immigrants, especially from Mexico, has become one of the major campaign topics in the primaries, with each candidate willing to say whatever it takes to appear tougher than the rest on border security.  \n<br><br>This widespread condemnation of immigrants is unfair and dishonest: Several economic studies have demonstrated that illegal immigrants\u2014an estimated 12 million work without official permits in the U.S.\u2014contribute far more to the U.S. economy than they take away from it. If those workers were forced to leave the country, as former Massachusetts governor and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney demands, the U.S. would suffer an immense economic crisis. \n<br><br>Nevertheless, several Republican candidates (with the notable exception of John McCain) trumpet immigration reform that involves deporting all 12 million of those here illegally on the basis that, among other things, illegal immigrants are stealing jobs from Americans. Besides the fact that such a policy is logistically unfeasible, it is also inconsistent with unemployment data. \n<br><br>The U.S. has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the developed world. The Department of Labor estimates that a mere five percent of the American population was without employment in December 2007. Contrary to what most Republicans would have you believe, Mexican workers and other migrants don\u2019t really compete for jobs with the five percent of America that is unemployed. They generally take unskilled and underpaid positions that other local workers don\u2019t want. Romney knows this, but he denies it in the interest of electoral victory.\n<br><br>In his quest to win conservative votes, Romney has lately toughened his tone against Mexican immigrants. His latest stance is that the border must be \u201csecured\u201d and that all migrants without work permits should be forced to leave the U.S. and apply for legal residency from their home countries.\n<br><br>To be sure, Romney\u2019s inconsistency on tough issues is widely recognized: He was pro-choice and then pro-life; he supported gun control and then he rejected it; he backed same sex marriage and then he opposed it. Yet, on the issue of immigration, he has not only been inconsistent, but revealed himself to be a hypocrite\u2014and not just because he hired migrants without work permits to mow his lawn.\n<br><br>The fact is that Romney\u2019s great grandfather, Miles Park Romney, and numerous other Mormons who practiced polygamy, fled across the U.S. border to seek protection in Mexico in 1884. They went to Mexico to avoid the investigations into their marriage practices ordered by the U.S. Congress, according to reports by Associated Press.\n<br><br>Miles Park Romney, who had five wives, took his children with him, one of whom was Romney\u2019s grandfather. He and his fellow Mormons crossed into Mexico where they managed to get protection. Miles Park stayed in the northern areas of Mexico for 28 years, until 1912. This is why Romney\u2019s father was born in Chihuahua, Mexico.\n<br><br>\u201cHarassed, hunted and persecuted because of their practice of plural marriage, a band of faithful Saints left the United States with mixed emotions on 5 March 1884 and crossed the border into Mexico, seeking refuge and the right to live their religion in peace,\u201d recounts the Encyclopedia of Latter-Day Saint History with regard to the earlier Romney\u2019s exodus, according to The Salt Lake Tribune.\n<br><br>Anna Amelia Pratt was born in the U.S. but also migrated to Mexico seeking protection because she was the granddaughter of Mormon apostle Parley Pratt, who had 12 wives and had also crossed the border seeking refuge. In Mexico she met Gaskell Romney, Mitt Romney\u2019s grandfather. Their marriage took place in 1895 in Dublan, Mexico, and their children were born there.\n<br><br>Many of Mitt Romney\u2019s relatives still live in the 5000-person, largely Mormon community of Colonia Juarez, Chihuahua. \u201cThere are now 3 million Mormons in Mexico. Their missionaries are literally everywhere. There were also still some of the Hatch family at Colonia Juarez just a few years ago,\u201d says religion writer John Hart, as quoted by Suzan Mazur.\n<br><br>In today\u2019s Republican party, it is acceptable to make pernicious remarks against Hispanics in the name of border security. Outright racism is only thinly veiled. But it\u2019s especially ironic that Mitt Romney, for the sake of political expediency, now attacks the immigration of citizens from the very same country that gave protection to his great-grandfather, grandfather and father and still hosts his cousins, nephews and nieces.\n<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Raul Penaranda, a Bolivian journalist, is an International Nieman Fellow at Harvard.</span></span></p>"}
{"title": "The Dems Can Save NCLB | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Throughout this primary, the Democratic debate on education reform has been hollow and lackluster, consisting of little more than vague attacks on No Child Left Behind (NCLB). Sidestepping any real discussion of NCLB, the candidates have instead focused their primary stumping on revamping pre-school and Head Start programs. Although early education is important, the next superintendent-in-chief will have to spend much more energy transforming NCLB, which, despite its many flaws, should remain the centerpiece of Federal education policy. <br><br>Shortcomings in how the Bush administration has administered the program notwithstanding, NCLB has a progressive design. It has its roots in the Clinton administration\u2019s Improving America\u2019s Schools Act of 1994, which aimed to improve local performance through federal oversight and channel funds to schools with underperforming minority students. The NCLB Act the George W. Bush team proposed to Congress in 2001 embodied many of the same principles, but increased autonomy for both states and local districts. And that is why it now fails. <br><br>NCLB is fouled up because it doesn\u2019t have enough muscle, and the consequences are severe. Although national scores have improved slightly and the racial achievement gap is narrowing in some parts of the country, NCLB fails to accomplish what its proponents said it would. Fourth graders can read in South Carolina but not in Tennessee. Eighth grade test scores are improving, but high school scores are plummeting. <br><br>Most people are uninformed as to what NCLB does and does not demand from schools. To begin with, it doesn\u2019t stipulate particular outcomes. The federal government merely encourages responsibility from districts and states by lightly policing administrative practices. In order to receive federal dollars\u2014which only account for 7% of the average school\u2019s funds\u2014states need only meet general requirements, like reporting test results, and administering school vouchers. Only in extreme circumstances are principals replaced, teachers fired, or students held back. Schools place imprudent emphasis on average test scores and become overly concerned with fealty to procedure, and the repercussion is that they don\u2019t monitor the performance of individual students. <br><br>I have to imagine that both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama recognize these weaknesses. But neither proposes bold changes, even though there are several integrated policies the Democrats could propose to solve the potency problem, all of which can be defended on party principles. To the extent that these ideas are already being espoused, it is only in vague language. <br><br>To be sure, Senator Obama has decried the lack of comprehensive evaluation of student progress and has suggested a tracking and feedback system that would measure both student and teacher performance from year to year. This is a good idea. <br><br>But, what it lacks, and what any serious education policy proposal must include, is support for a national exam, which would centralize and streamline the criteria for success. Why should each state fashion its own standards if they\u2019re all receiving the same federal funding? <br><br>Such an exam would be a content-based, minimum competency test, ensuring that students learn basic skills before exiting each grade. Such an exam adds the benefits of closer student-teacher relationships due to team preparation, and helps to pinpoint the areas in which a student or teacher is underperforming in comparison to their peers across the country. <br><br>A transformative education plan should incorporate higher teacher accountability measures, which will have to sit well with the National Education Association (NEA), which unites powerful teachers\u2019 unions and exerts a tremendous amount of control over votes, campaign funds, and school boards. <br><br>A bargain must be struck, swapping an increase in general teacher salaries for stricter standards on how well teachers must perform to keep their post. The NEA is violently opposed to any threats to traditional job security, but like any other lobby can be paid off. Democrats should propose extra pay for teachers in underserved areas. Higher wages overall will help ensure a bargain and improve the prestige of the profession. Teacher\u2019s should receive more benefits, but not without more responsibilities. <br><br>Lastly, the Democrat candidates would do well to address NCLB\u2019s major structural problem. Only one candidate, Senator Hillary Clinton, has been perspicacious enough to do so thus far. <br><br>Hillary\u2019s platform notes that we should measure school improvement based on the year-to-year performance of students rather than by how schools with disparate local funds stack-up against each other. Currently, all schools are expected to have a certain percentage of students meet a predetermined level of math and reading proficiency each year. This is a bit like asking the tortoise to beat the hare. It\u2019s possible, but highly unlikely outside the fairy-tale world of stump-rhetoric. Rather than asking low-income schools to catch-up to institutions soaked in high property taxes, the program should dish out rewards and sanctions based on individual school improvement. <br><br>Most students and teachers care about how they measure up. They just need to have a clear set of standards to shoot for and then they can choose the means themselves. <br><br>A centralized education strategy helps Democrats best the Republican Party, as it puts them truly arm-in-arm with the American Dream. Senator John McCain is focused on pumping up the voucher system rather than transforming a more-than-salvageable policy. If the Democratic public policy agenda calls for a high-standards education system, attached to a strong economy and national security\u2014at a time when middle-class voters are beginning to link these concepts in their own minds\u2014they will be victorious in November.<br><br style=\"FONT-STYLE: italic\"><span style=\"FONT-STYLE: italic\">Ra\u00fal A.

{"title": "Identity Theft | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>When Democratic voters headed to the polls yesterday in 24 states, they continued to define a historic race for the presidency. Though each day brings us closer to predicting a winner, the Democratic nominee this year will be either a woman or an African-American. <br><br>The diversity in candidates this year is extraordinary, and we should be proud that constituencies underrepresented in politics have found a place on the national stage. It would be shortsighted, however, to reduce Senator Barack Obama\u2019s or Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s candidacies to their respective race and gender\u2014something which our national media has unfortunately been doing. <br><br>From the beginning of the presidential race, print and broadcast media ruminated on one question: How would voters react to the new faces of the Democratic party? The press wondered whether Clinton was too tough to appeal to women, or Obama too white to appeal to blacks. When Hillary Clinton\u2019s victory in New Hampshire was credited to a surge in feminine sympathy after a teary-eye moment on the eve of the election, pundits quibbled over the statistical weight of the \u201cidentity effect.\u201d <br><br>Americans weren\u2019t the only ones to ask themselves these questions. After a woman sought the French presidency, and Germany, Chile, and Argentina elected female heads of state, the international press questioned Americans\u2019 own ability to elect a black or a female candidate. Reporting here and abroad both centered on the politics of identity, rather than the politics of policy. <br><br>Granted, no discussion of the presidential candidates would be complete without attention to their personal characteristics. It\u2019s important to recognize the candidates\u2019 extraordinary identities, and it\u2019s constructive for America to reflect on the place of women and blacks in political society. There is a fine line, however, between that discussion and one that empowers identity above all else. <br><br>The distinction was embraced by Clinton and Obama, who made an effort to keep their identity separate from their policy. Both could expect advantages among women or African-Americans, and both naturally sought the endorsements that would complement their identity. But they also expressed a wish that race and gender should have no part of the campaign, and stuck to that attitude in political debates. Clinton and Obama recognized this principle: that in the race for the nomination as in the general election, the stakes of identity and solidarity should not overshadow the debate on the fate of the nation. The presidential election should not become, nor be portrayed as, a referendum on American tolerance\u2014regardless of how the press spins it. <br><br>Americans streamed into the streets for the rights of women and blacks for the better part of last century. Demonstrators have historically wanted subaltern groups to speak for themselves, but they have also wanted them to have a chance to simply speak. Now that our national politics have empowered those with a traditionally marginalized race and gender, we should foster a political climate in which they can transcend those particularities and debate instead about the urgent concerns of our nation\u2019s governance. <br><br>Super Tuesday has identified two contenders for the Democratic nomination. Now more than ever, it is time for the national media to overcome identity politics and give their due to platforms and policy. In the critical months before the Democratic convention, Americans are entitled to no less. <br><br></span></p>"}

I was a full-time missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) on the south side, and though I was not supposed to read newspapers, I knew who Obama was from the signs in the windows and the front-page articles I glimpsed on porches while I knocked on doors.  When my companion and I saw Obama in person, we stopped him and shook his hand. The first question he asked was, \u201cAre you from Utah?\u201d\n<br><br>Future president Obama treated us kindly that day on the street. With characteristic optimism, he viewed us as potential friends. But we were not from Utah, and it may have surprised him to know that I, for one, had voted Democrat in 2000 and 2002. And I will be voting for him in 2008.\n<br><br>Boston-area Mormons have had a long time to get to know Mitt Romney, and we have followed his campaign to see how the American public received a serious Mormon candidate. We share with Romney a kinship of faith.  But not all of us will be voting for him.\n<br><br>The Boston chapter of Mormons for Equality and Social Justice (MESJ) has found instead that Barack Obama embodies the values of faith put in action and will best lead our country to become more fair and prosperous. We trust his experience as a community organizer, civil rights lawyer, and legislator as proof that he will promote peace, equality, and justice in whatever situation he finds himself. We pray that he will find himself in the White House.\n<br><br>Obama best represents our attitudes about the uses of faith in politics. In contrast to Romney, who in his 2007 speech \u201cFaith in America\u201d sought to unite believing voters, in his own 2006 signature speech on religion and public life Senator Obama called for a coalition of progressives, both believers and secularists. Obama possesses the unique perspective as a lifelong rationalist and recent convert to speak sincerely to all Americans.  \n<br><br>Without a doubt, the prejudices of the American people are being tested. On principle, are they willing to vote for a woman, an African-American, a Mormon? They may be most reluctant to elect a Mormon, a fact that dismays us. But we take heart in the ongoing success of progressive Mormon politicians like Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. We await the day when a Mormon Democrat runs for president.\n<br><br>Mormons have a long history of progressive politics, dating back to founder Joseph Smith\u2019s 1844 presidential campaign which called for the abolition of slavery. Although in more recent decades LDS adherents have acquired a reputation for conservatism, Mormons such as Stewart Udall (Secretary of the Interior) and Esther Peterson (Department of Labor, Women\u2019s Bureau) have served the country in the Kennedy, Johnson, and Carter administrations. In January 2005, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and others organized the Mormon Democratic Congressional Caucus in hopes of tapping into this progressive tradition of politics among Mormons.\n<br><br>Mormon women in the Boston area have worked in less overtly political ways through the creation of Exponent II, an organization and publication of the same name, aimed at raising consciousness of women\u2019s issues and rights within the context of Mormonism.  Several of the founders of the Mormon Peace Project and the Mormon Worker paper are church members from Boston or Harvard alums.  \n<br><br>As progressive Mormons, we call for Obama to take even bolder steps when elected than he has outlined in his campaign. Many of us hope that he will have the courage to extend marriage equality to all people, to revise and expand his healthcare program, and to use diplomacy to promote peace abroad.  \n<br><br>Among the quickly-narrowing pool of Republican candidates, we commend Senator John McCain\u2019s firm opposition to the use of torture in violation of the Geneva Conventions and Representative Ron Paul\u2019s rejection of the hawkish foreign policy that has dominated the post-9/11 years.\n<br><br>In 2008, we are thrilled with our choices for the Democratic nominee for president, and we publicly avow support for the best candidate in the field, Barack Obama.<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Thomas M.

{"title": "Not So Super | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>If primary campaign strategy is any indication, the U.S. presidential election is far less democratic that it pretends to be. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama began their bids with months of fundraising and media spin, and it seems now that they will end it by soliciting votes from party elites instead of the American people.<br><br>In a contest with just over 4,000 total delegates, these unpledged Democratic \u201csuperdelegates\u201d control almost 800 votes\u2014a 20 percent stake that could become the margin of victory in the nomination.  The Republicans, gradually coalescing around John McCain, have been spared the superdelegate dogfight in 2008, but their policy is far from commendable: 19 percent of the delegates to the Republican National Convention are unpledged; of those, a significant portion is unelected.  In this election and every election, the chance that a handful of political elites has the power to overturn the will of the people is an unforgivable affront to democracy.<br><br>One citizen, one vote: A principle basic enough for elementary students to grasp manages to elude our major political parties. Privileged as they are by electoral laws that make third-party success all but impossible, the Democrats and Republicans cannot hide behind tired excuses of their moral or legal independence as \u201cprivate organizations.\u201d Their fundamental tie to the government\u2014which, for example, allows primary election ballots to run alongside other state election issues\u2014obligates these political parties to higher standards of democratic fairness than mere private institutions. They may not be government entities in name, but they are as influential. No viable presidential candidate has emerged from a third party since Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s bid for reelection, and the last third-party candidate to win an election was Abraham Lincoln in 1860. For the foreseeable future, every presidential election will be a contest between a Democrat and a Republican; for the United States to be fairly considered a democracy, the selection of the parties\u2019 nominees must obey democratic principles as well. <br><br>We recognize, however, that altering this year\u2019s nomination rules to strip superdelegates of their power would be impractical, unjust, and dishonest toward the candidates who have invested months and years developing strategies to fit them. Moreover, it would further undermine the Democratic National Committee\u2019s authority in an election cycle that has already strained its relationship with state parties over front-loading in the primary schedule.<br><br>Nonetheless, while superdelegates are currently under no legal requirement to endorse the choice of their constituents, the accompanying moral obligation is not so easily avoided. The old rationalization that \u201cparty leaders know best\u201d is both paternalistic and wrong: The presidential nominee of each party should be the choice of all its members, not of the political elites with vested interests in a particular party structure. <br><br>Currently, Clinton holds a lead of 231 Democratic superdelegates to Obama\u2019s 145,  a vestige of the days before primary campaigning began in earnest, when she was the presumptive choice of the party establishment and the seemingly unbeatable frontrunner. Months later, Obama has won more contests and built more momentum than his rival; and if he continues to do so superdelegates should vote to best reflect the sentiments of the people. <br><br>In addition to this reliance on superdelegates, so much else is wrong with the current presidential nomination process: the tremendous cost that ties candidates\u2019 fates to wealthy donors; the unbalanced calendar that disproportionately favors a few unrepresentative states; and, most of all, the fundamentally undemocratic nature of the caucuses that are still used in many states. All three conditions favor hyperactive political elites over ordinary voters, but caucuses are a particularly egregious assault on democratic equality. The caucus structure disenfranchises voters, discouraging ordinary citizens with its substantial time demands, and essentially silencing those who must work during caucus hours. Worst of all, they strip voters of the anonymity that has always been democracy\u2019s best defense against demagoguery and coercion.<br><br>As vast as the structural problems with caucusing are, however, it still produces a more just and accurate reflection of public sentiment than do the biases of party leaders. Both Democratic and Republican national committees would do well to avoid a repeat of this election\u2019s mistakes and abolish unpledged delegates before 2012. It will not be enough, of course; only wholesale reform can fully restore democratic ideals to the presidential nomination process. But it would be a start. <br><br></span></p>"}

{"title": "An Open Letter to Ann Coulter | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Dear Ms. Coulter, it was nice to have had a chance to see you last Friday in Washington. I wondered, though, if perhaps you\u2019re running out of material. For example, when you said that Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cfirst big accomplishment\u201d was having been \u201cborn half-black,\u201d I was not sure I was sitting close enough to hear you correctly. I was reminded of your previous remarks about institutions of mental health that you made in connection to John Edwards a year ago at CPAC. I must confess\u2014I didn\u2019t think it was possible to display irrational, medieval attitudes, to undermine your own party and to do violence to our nation\u2019s history and principles and call it conservatism, all at the same time. Your speech proved me wrong. <br><br>You laid out a list of all the shortcomings of John McCain, the apparent Republican nominee. These, too, were tired and predictable: he opposes torture, he did not vote for Bush\u2019s tax cuts and he supports \u201camnesty\u201d for illegal immigrants. This led you to assert that Republicans may be better off voting for Clinton in the same way that Churchill was forced to ally himself with Stalin in order to fight Hitler. <br><br>\u201cI\u2019m not comparing McCain to Hitler,\u201d you added. \u201cHitler had a coherent tax policy.\u201d <br><br>I do not know about you, Ms. Coulter, but those of us who have spoken with Second World War survivors tend to prefer freedom to oppression, regardless of the prevailing tax policy. If Osama bin Laden supported lower tax rates than any U.S. presidential candidate, would you be willing to endorse him? Anything for a headline, right? (If so, I would encourage you to reconsider your enthusiastic defense of torture, considering that at present, such conspicuous sympathy with terrorists oftentimes leads to some less-than-friendly interrogation). <br><br>You deride a centrist Republican and veteran for his rejection of your outlandish brand of conservatism but in the same breath you trivialize and mock the heroes who bravely fought against the tide of Nazism, something the \u201ctrue conservative\u201d you seek would never do. Of course, every argument can be reduced to comparisons with Hitler; most people just have the integrity and good sense not to do so. I would imagine that the Nazis enjoyed hunting, but I have not yet heard even the most dyed-in-the-wool liberals use this fact as an argument against the Second Amendment. When you decide to employ a logical fallacy, please try not to pick one that even economics students can identify. <br><br>You poked fun at McCain\u2019s experiences in the Vietnam War (\u201ccouldn\u2019t we pick a POW who doesn\u2019t want to shut down Guantanamo?\u201d) and quipped that the Arizona senator is running for President because he wants to improve his New York Times obituary. Rest assured, Ms. Coulter, that McCain will be around for a while and that your morbid desire to the contrary, fed by your frustrated ego after the rejection of your favorite conservative sweetheart Mitt Romney, is as appalling as your belief that the empty venom you spit is somehow humorous or interesting. <br><br>Why did I not vacate my seat, you may ask, if I take issue with your style, substance and mission to fracture the Republican Party? The reason is simple: leaving the talk would have meant giving up a rare opportunity to peer into the bottom of the American political barrel and the outright perversion of dialogue and the English language. Note that I didn\u2019t stay because I was outraged or secretly thrilled by your audacious accusations and asides; the experience was more like staring at a car wreck. I don\u2019t know, Ms. Coulter, if you thought you had given your audience something to think about, or that your \u201cdirt\u201d on John McCain would lead us to reconsider the upcoming election, but I write to inform you that you failed at both.<br><br><em>Jan Zilinsky \u201909, a Crimson editorial editor, is an economics concentrator in Mather House.</em></span></p>"}

{"title": "\u2018Super\u2019 My Ass  | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The first time CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer said \u201csuperdelegates,\u201d I didn\u2019t know exactly what to think. One image that came to mind was the Democratic Party\u2019s version of a Harvard admissions booklet: a perfect mix of men, women, young adults, whites, blacks, Latinos, and Asians, each from a different state in our beautiful Union, who would represent the Party this summer on stage at the convention. Alternatively, I pictured a contest hosted by Howard Dean to choose which delegates looked best in \u201cSuperman\u201d costumes, the winner of which would escort the Democratic nominee around Denver on Aug. 28.\n<br><br>Oh, how I wish.\n<br><br>Instead, superdelegates are Democratic bigwigs and elected officials. Totaling 796 people, they are composed of the entire Democratic Congress, all Democratic governors, some big-city mayors, high-ranking members of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), and various others whom I cannot pick out from the DNC\u2019s lengthy rulebook.\n<br><br>In addition to superdelegates, there are not-so-super, regular \u201cdelegates.\u201d These are the John Does and Jane Smiths whom Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have been publicly battling for across the country. Votes are collected in Democratic caucuses and primaries and candidates are awarded \u201cdelegates\u201d based on how many votes they receive. These delegates arrive in Denver on Aug. 28 and vote for either Senator Obama or Senator Clinton, depending on which candidate won their district. Whichever candidate receives at least 2,025 votes at the convention becomes the nominee. \n<br><br>Let\u2019s break that number down: a magic majority of 2,025 means that there are 4,049 total votes, 3,253 of which are \u201cdelegates\u201d\u2014awarded by popular voting\u2014and 796 of which are \u201csuperdelegates.\u201d In most elections since 1972, the year that the Democratic nominating process began to be democratized, one candidate dominated the caucuses and primaries so much that superdelegates were irrelevant; a candidate could collect 2,025 votes at the convention just from delegates. \n<br><br>But in this ever-so-special year, every vote in Denver will count. As of today, Barack Obama has won 986 delegates, and Hillary Clinton 924, according to CNN.  If Virginia, Ohio, Texas, Pennsylvania, and Indiana vote as expected over the coming months, the margin will remain razor-thin and the nomination could be decided by how superdelegates vote. Democrats might even have a Bush-Gore disaster on their hands: Obama could win more regular delegates than Clinton, but because of Clinton\u2019s close connections with superdelegates, she could win the nomination anyway. \n<br><br>When I asked the DNC about this situation, the organization declined to comment, and repeated attempts to contact the Obama and Clinton campaigns were ignored (What about the student vote, spokespeople?) The DNC is likely embarrassed that this wonderful and energizing primary, in which a record number of Democrats have voted, might be decided by the gut feelings of DNC officials, or by which Cabinet position a senator thinks he can get if Obama or Clinton moves into the White House. How un-Democratic. \n<br><br>What\u2019s worse, the Democratic Party <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">knows</span> it\u2019s un-Democratic. In 1968, after the ludicrous nomination of then-Vice President Hubert Humphrey, the Democratic Party reformed the selection process to give more \u201cpower to the people.\u201d Unlike the past, when nominations were decided by the elites of the Democratic Party (think \u201csuperdelegates\u201d), votes in the primaries and caucuses would actually receive their due. Hence 3,253 delegates and 796 superdelegates.  \n<br><br>The question remains, however, why keep any superdelegates? Why should Howard Dean, who will cast his vote as Chairman of the DNC for either Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton based on his own inclinations, have the same power as a delegate from California who represents thousands of Democratic voters?  \n<br><br>And what about Rule #5 of the delegate selection rulebook? (I may be the only person who has read this horribly long and boring document): \u201cDiscrimination on the basis of \u2018status\u2019 in Democratic Party affairs is prohibited.\u201d Again, the DNC would not comment on the obvious hypocrisy between this rule and the existence of superdelegates, who are merely high-status Democrats. \n<br><br>I know that Howard Dean loves the Democratic Party, and that most other superdelegates only want the best for the Party. But what does it say when Party elites\u2019 votes count so much more than the average voter\u2019s? Moreover, I worry, maybe too cynically, about corruption in this process: What is to stop Senators Obama or Clinton from hinting at a Cabinet position in return for that last, tie-breaking superdelegate? \n<br><br>Democrats need to start e-mailing and calling the DNC to express their disappointment that this election could come down to the whims of superdelegates. There are many problems with this lengthy nominating process, but superdelegates are especially egregious, and more importantly, easily changeable. Democrats have until March 1 before the superdelegate selection process is finalized, and who knows, maybe Howard Dean will surprise the world again. Maybe he will further the Party\u2019s move toward actually trusting \u201cthe people\u201d in choosing its nominee and rid itself of superdelegates. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">That</span> would be super. \n<br><br>\n<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Andrew D.

Dershowitz, made a Valentine\u2019s Day visit to Cambridge yesterday. But it wasn\u2019t candy hearts and flowers that he brought with him. <br><br>Speaking before a standing-room only audience at the Biology Labs, Trivers introduced the issue of self-deception, and then used it as a platform for comments about the false historical narratives that he ascribed to both Americans and Israelis. <br><br>But before delving into his speech, the award-winning biologist had some choice words for his most high-profile Harvard opponent, whom he called \u201ca deeply dishonest organism, if there ever was one,\u201d and cast as an impediment to free discussion in the face of \u201csensitivities\u201d about Israel. <br><br>\u201cAt Harvard, I think we can do better than to follow the likes of Alan Dershowitz. Yes we can,\u201d Trivers exclaimed, imitating the popularized campaign slogan of presidential candidate and former Law School student Barack Obama. <br><br>Trivers has alleged that Dershowitz was instrumental in the cancellation of a speech that he was scheduled to give at Harvard\u2019s Program for Evolutionary Dynamics last May. While Dershowitz suggested on Tuesday that he might protest the Trivers speech, he was not in attendance yesterday. <br><br>But his presence was evident. As Trivers began to talk, the audience passed around copies of a letter he had sent to Dershowitz. <br><br>\u201cLet me just say that if there is a repeat of Israeli butchery towards Lebanon and if you decide once again to rationalize it publicly, look forward to a visit from me,\u201d reads the message, which refers to Dershowitz as a \u201cnazi-like apologist.\u201d <br><br>Dershowitz has repeatedly insisted that the letter constituted a physical threat. <br><br>It was not clear who among the audience brought the copies of the letter or began to pass them around, but Dershowitz admitted yesterday to supplying a copy to someone who planned on attending the event. <br><br>\u201cI was called and asked whether I could provide a copy of the letter and I did,\u201d said Dershowitz, before detailing the security measures his office had taken in preparation for Trivers\u2019 appearance on campus. <br><br>\u201cMy secretary, who is a karate expert, was standing guard at the door to make sure there was no violence,\u201d he added. <br><br>The most controversial material in yesterday\u2019s speech appeared not to be any reference to Dershowitz but rather the content concerning Israel. <br><br>On a slide entitled \u201cFalse Historical Narratives: Israel,\u201d Trivers called into question the claim by the Israeli people that they adopted \u201ca land without people for a people without a land.\u201d He said that the statement was belied by the hundreds of thousands of Arabs who became refugees when Israel was founded in 1948. <br><br>Trivers also questioned the legitimacy of the grievances cited by Israelis in their decision to take military action against Lebanon in the summer of 2006. His remark prompted a challenge from the audience following the talk. <br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s just sort of hard as someone who came from that region prior to that conflict to have someone say that Israel should have made peace when someone had just attacked them,\u201d said one questioner. <br><br>\u201cYour description is inaccurate on its face,\u201d replied Trivers. <br><br>\u201cI don\u2019t think that [the U.S] would level Mexico if some subgroup killed three and seized two,\u201d he added. <br><br>Following the speech, one member of the audience, Anthropology Professor J. Lorand Matory, said he was not surprised that some seemed skeptical of Trivers\u2019 speech. <br><br>\u201cYou know, to self-deceiving Zionists, all of that was a lie,\u201d Matory said. \u201cPeople produce quotations that this land [Israel] was unoccupied before they got there...some people learn this in Saturday school, and it\u2019s a function of self-deception.\u201d <br><br>Matory sponsored legislation this fall in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences that alleged that sensitivities about Israel have hindered free speech on campus. <br><br>Trivers noted after the speech that the audience\u2014estimated at about 200 by the event\u2019s host, Biology Professor David A. Haig\u2014had been \u201cextremely receptive and warm.\u201d <br><br>He added that he had deliberately decided to minimize the number of references in his speech that concerned his feud with Dershowitz. <br><br>\u201cI was taught as a youngster not to get into a pissing contest with a skunk, and I got in one with [Dershowitz], to my detriment,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now I\u2019ll save my urine for a better purpose.\u201d <br><br><em>\u2014Staff writer Christian B.

Think rather of a fifteen- round boxing match. The fact that one fighter may be more bloodied at the end may not matter if he (or she) is still standing and has the same or more points over fifteen rounds.\n<br><br>Horse race enthusiasts are now saying that Hillary Clinton must \u201cdecisively\u201d capture Texas, Ohio, and Pennsylvania to claim the nomination. Why? No one doubts that if she fails to win a majority of the votes in both Texas and Ohio on March 4, her chances of winning the nomination outright are negligible. However, a week ago (with Hillary leading slightly in the delegate count), the commentators told us it was a draw. Now, with Obama having seized the momentum (and leading slightly in the delegate count) the commentators would have it that it is incumbent on Hillary not simply to sustain the stalemate, but to win decisively in all three of Texas, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, as if under any other circumstances Obama is entitled to be the nominee. Couldn\u2019t a less decisive result simply show us that it\u2019s still a draw, with neither candidate bearing the onus of being the diehard? \n<br><br>A Hillary victory in Texas, by whatever margin, and a close finish, whoever wins, in Ohio and Pennsylvania will leave the delegate count very close. Hillary will have been the winner in four of the five largest states. The tally of the popular vote from all the primaries\u2014including Florida and Michigan\u2014will be extremely close and whomever it favors, Hillary will almost certainly have been the first choice of registered Democrats. \n<br><br>Articles decrying the possibility that the superdelegates will decide the election are already legion, with the general theme being that the superdelegates should simply confirm the selection of the voters. But what would that mean, in specific terms?  Should it be winner take all by state? Proportional by state? Or all the superdelegates simply to the candidate who won the most delegates? Or the winner of the popular vote? Or the winner among registered Democrats? And what about Florida and Michigan in these calculations? In short, either camp can make a \u201cfollow-the-voters\u201d argument to suit its purposes.\n<br><br>And once you get past anything pretending to be a neutral basis for deciding how the superdelegates should vote, we are reduced to what will be universally perceived as an exercise in bare-knuckle politics. All the racial, gender, generational, and income contradictions in the party will play themselves out in an undemocratic process that will be utterly lacking in transparency. Paranoia will be rampant and dissatisfaction with the final result, whenever it is achieved, will be profound. \n<br><br>Such a process, inclusive of the unresolved conflict about Florida and Michigan, could last into the convention. I hope that the Obama camp chooses someone other than Ted Kennedy to lecture Hillary about the supposed damage she\u2019ll be doing the party if she\u2019s carrying on her fight through the summer. In 1980, Kennedy waited until the day before the convention began to abandon a challenge to Jimmy Carter, a sitting President, although he was behind by approximately a thousand delegates. Who\u2019s going be the elder statesman to tell Hillary she should abandon her quest to be the first woman President because she trails by a few delegates, with Florida and Michigan still uncounted?\n<br><br>This nightmare scenario is all the more disturbing in light of the fact that the Democratic primary has witnessed unprecedented participation, turnout, and international attention. Democrats are widely reported to be wildly enthusiastic about their choice, as well as frequently anguished about that same choice when they\u2019re alone in the ballot booth. Whether the drama concludes at the convention or before, either the woman or the African-American will walk away a bitter loser, and people who assume that this bitterness will not have broader repercussions for the party in November and beyond are kidding themselves. \n<br><br>Howard Dean has alluded to a possible \u201carrangement\u201d to avoid the superdelegate scramble. However, with Obama currently claiming the Big Mo, serious discussion of such an arrangement is unlikely unless and until the results on March 4 make it apparent that we still have a stalemate. At the same time, notwithstanding the dearth of daylight between the candidates on policy or any history of personal animosity prior to the commencement of the campaign, the sheer ferocity of the conflict by that point, in the words of Donna Brazile, may make a \u201cdream ticket\u201d nothing more than a \u201cfantasy ticket.\u201d It may be a fantasy, but the alternative scenario for Democrats is a nightmare. \n<br><br>For this reason, I would submit that it is not too early to discuss what a Clinton/Obama \u201carrangement\u201d would look like. In my humble opinion, it should resemble the Tony Blair/Gordon Brown partnership, but without the wiggle room. Hillary at the top of the ticket but publicly committed to serving only one term. Hillary the decision-maker, but Obama given major domestic portfolios. In short, a partnership that contemplates both a woman and an African-American in the White House and Democratic dominance of the executive branch for (hopefully) the next twelve years. \n<br><br>In fact, there is historical precedent for an attempt at a partnered presidency, which, in its eleventh hour character, offers lessons on how the process should not be conducted. In 1980, Ronald Reagan engaged in intense negotiations at the Republican convention for ex-President Gerald Ford to return as Reagan\u2019s super-vice president. Later that night, the discussions finally faltered, Reagan picked up the phone and belatedly offered the vice-presidency to someone else . Enter George H. W. Bush and, eventually, George W. Bush. Of such missed opportunities and personal dynamics, history is made.\n<br><br>Clinton/Obama \u201908: An unprecedented solution to an unprecedented situation. \n<br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Clay A.

Her attacks on Bobby Jindal are politically motivated, but instead of taking issue with his policy positions, Sequeira implies that he is not a true \u201cIndian,\u201d whatever that means. \r<br><br>When she writes that Indian-Americans supported Kerry over Bush in 2004 by a ratio of four-to-one, are we to assume that the 20 percent that went to Bush aren\u2019t Indian either? Is liberalism an inherently \u201cIndian\u201d trait? Even as the majority of Indians are liberal, what bearing does this have on Mr. Jindal\u2019s political beliefs? Is he not allowed to believe what he believes solely because the majority of people with brown skin disagree with him? These suggestions are absurd, but not nearly as appalling as her other suggestion: That Jindal is somehow forsaking his Indian heritage by attending Oxford and working for McKinsey. If these measures are the standards by which \u201crace traitors\u201d are judged, perhaps Sequeira should write an editorial denouncing Mohandas Gandhi or Barack Obama or the countless other Americans of color who are succeeding in the world on their own merits. \r<br><br> <br><br>WILL C.

{"title": "A Liberal\u2019s Case Against Clinton | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Not too long ago, I was on YouTube.com. By not too long ago, I mean yesterday. The Web site has become what I am prepared to call an obsession\u2014and with Super Tuesday on my mind, this night was more approximate to a craze. Amidst the frenzy, I managed to stumble upon a clip of Hillary Clinton in one of last year\u2019s Democratic debates. The question posed was, \u201cAre you a liberal?\u201d As Hillary furtively and spinelessly answered the simple question\u2014in effect saying no\u2014I began to think about the presidential election and remember her for the person she actually was. \n<br><br>Throughout her experienced political career\u2014the one to which she constantly refers but never actually defines\u2014Hillary Clinton has failed as a liberal. As a student at Wellesley, she actively campaigned for Republican Barry Goldwater, a man who more than once spoke of pre-emptively nuking the USSR and who also opposed civil rights.    \n<br><br>On the major issue of our time, the Iraq War, she voted for the resolution authorizing war, arguing that Saddam Hussein must \u201cdisarm or be disarmed\u201d.  Subsequently, when public support of the war started diminishing, Clinton\u2019s perspective changed accordingly\u2014a change politicized further by her refusal to honestly accept her vote as a mistake. In its place, she shirked blame, arguing that President Bush implemented Operation Iraqi Freedom poorly. She has also criticized the May 2007 troop surge, offensively proclaiming that if Iraqis are \u201cnot going to stand up and take responsibility, we should not lose another American life.\u201d  \n<br><br>Even Hillary\u2019s viewpoint on healthcare has transformed significantly from the liberal and more well-known one she espoused in the early \u201990s that enlisted the government, rather than private health insurance companies, to provide universal health coverage.  To many former supporters, this was a proposal that didn\u2019t make sense, given that it was the profit-maximizing function of corporations that induces much of the current system\u2019s quality and accessibility issues. But it started to come together once I realized that Clinton receives more funding from insurance and pharmaceutical companies than anybody other politician\u2014Republican or Democrat.  Indeed, as the reality became clearer to me, a very different Hillary emerged than the one Americans saw crying in New Hampshire recently because she cared so much about us.\n<br><br> And yet Hillary has ranked as the Democratic frontrunner for almost the entirety of the past year. For a quite while, I could not understand this. Were America\u2019s progressives really not going to stand up for their beliefs? Didn\u2019t any Clinton supporter remember the disastrous results that this style of political meandering had wrought in the previous two elections? Was I just a nutcase, a sexist, or even worse\u2014Mike Gravel? \n<br><br>Luckily, before that irreversible leap into insanity, my answer arrived \u2013 in the form of a vividly older and angrier Bill Clinton taking on the stage. It was after his wife\u2019s unexpected defeat in Iowa, and at first, I was taken aback. But then it came to me. At her weakest political moment, Hillary did not stand up for the positions or the campaigning style that had led to her downfall. \n<br><br>Instead, she hid behind her consultants and had Bubba\u2014a man popular among many progressives\u2014make the case. As much as she had tried to say otherwise, I recognized precisely then that this campaign really wasn\u2019t about her or her political \u201cexperience.\u201d It was about Bill Clinton and evoking the popularity of his presidency as justification for the reentry of both Clintons into the White House. The issue was Bill, not Hillary.\n<br><br> Even further, this is a man, who despite his current popularity among progressives, underwent a good amount of liberal scrutiny as well\u2014from free trade to \u201cworkfare\u201d to the wars in Kosovo and Bosnia. Indeed, there was a significant element of the Left that was so fed up with the dishonesty and hypocrisy of the Clinton administration that it was willing to vote for Ralph Nader in 2000, knowing full well such the political implications of such an act. \n<br><br>The problem with Hillary\u2019s political waffling intensified, in my mind, when considering the current political milieu. Terrorism, not sex scandals, now run across the pages of American newspapers. Many Republicans, members of a party dominated by right wing militants, now consider John McCain too liberal. In such an environment the conservative movement is so pronouncedly influential and visible that what democracy needs is a countermovement to balance politics\u2014not compromising cowards who accommodate the extreme. \n<br><br>This isn\u2019t just a matter of principle. It is also one of electability. In 2004, Democrats reluctantly selected John Kerry as their nominee, reasoning that his centrism would make him a safe bet come the general election. The result was defeat despite the many blunders of the Bush administration that, during the 2003 primary season, made a Democratic victory seem inevitable. His loss reflected voters\u2019 rejection of such meandering centrism, and desire for a Democratic countermovement.\n<br><br>Conceding the Democratic Party\u2019s true liberal principles has simply proven itself a losing strategy\u2014and with someone like Mrs. Clinton, who possesses neither charm nor popular appeal, losing very quickly becomes likely. If Democrats recognize this, they may be one step closer to victory.\n<br><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Sahand Moarefy \u201910, a Crimson business editor, is an economics concentrator in Mather House.</span></span></p>"}

McCain now holds 689 delegates, 533 more than former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and 556 more than Romney, according to The New York Times.\r<br><br>In his address to the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) yesterday, Romney said that if he continued his campaign, he would be helping Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama win the White House. \r<br><br>\u201cI entered this race because I love America, and because I love America, I feel I must now stand aside, for our party and for our country,\u201d Romney said.\r<br><br>N.

{"title": "The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>For just under a month, reporters have been fashioning articles about the financial crisis by simply listing the venerable Wall Street institutions that have met their demise: Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, and, most recently, Washington Mutual. \n<br><br>The body count is, to be sure, an astonishing one: in less than a year, three of the nation\u2019s five independent investment banks are gone, and a major insurance company and two behemoth mortgage firms have been effectively nationalized.\n<br><br>Unsurprisingly, the news of so many failures has prompted some Harvard professors to begin hoping that undergraduates, who have been flocking to finance for as long as anyone can remember (that is, for four years), will take a broader view of their career choices. Indeed, the angst that accompanies \u201cselling out\u201d has never been far below the surface, so much so that University President Drew G. Faust devoted her baccalaureate address to that very subject in June. Just four months later, with the prospects for a career on Wall Street approaching the prospects of a career in journalism, isn\u2019t it the perfect time for us to start choosing from a broader palette of careers?\n<br><br>But Harvard\u2019s budding financiers have an easy response to people like Kenneth S. Rogoff, the distinguished Harvard economist and former International Monetary Fund official who garnered applause at the expert panel on the financial crisis last week by saying that the \u201cbloated\u201d financial sector has been in need of a correction and that Harvard students would do well to \u201cgo into other activities.\u201d \n<br><br>Some Harvard students watching the speech\u2014at least those sitting around me\u2014sneered that  Rogoff didn\u2019t realize that for Harvard students accustomed to jobs at the upper echelon of finance, the usual recruiting suspects remain alive, if not quite well. Indeed, of the behemoths that have gone under in the past months, only Lehman Brothers was a major recruiter at Harvard. The most sought-after financial recruiters\u2014namely Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, and Citigroup\u2014have survived the recent turmoil and have shown their health by buying up the dismembered parts of other firms. If these three remain strong in the coming years (all, including Citi, remain well-capitalized) and businesses continue to have the need for management consultants (who have been affected little by the downturn), it\u2019s not clear at first blush that the recent downturn is anything more than a small, sealable crack in Harvard\u2019s pipeline to Wall Street.\n<br><br>But the smug dismissal of Rogoff\u2019s point and our confidence in our own brilliance shouldn\u2019t obscure the facts. Some middle-of-the-road analyses by the free-market crowd at the University of Chicago find that about 15 percent of jobs on Wall Street are part of the bubble and won\u2019t be replaced even when the finance industry regains its longterm health. And that too may not be for sometime. As Rogoff said in an interview with The Crimson on Tuesday, \u201cwe might be back at full steam in 2010, but full steam will probably be slower than it used to be, because our financial system is decimated.\u201d\n<br><br>So at least for the moment, there just might be that perfect storm of trends that could compel students\u2014at least in the Classes of 2009 and 2010\u2014to seek out the options that Faust urged upon us before the Street imploded. And there\u2019s some evidence that we are: Officials from Teach for America, the national teacher-placing service that has made significant inroads on elite campuses, report that the number of students turning in applications by the first deadline skyrocketed. Peace Corps administrators report an uptick in applicants, as do graduate schools of all sorts. And if Barack Obama\u2014the heartthrob of liberals and college students, and a particular one for liberal college students\u2014wins the presidency this November, more of us would probably head south to the Potomac than in any year since 1992, and potentially since 1960.\n<br><br>And politics, to finish the circle, might end up being more important for future jobs than one would think. A little-noticed provision added to the bailout bill over the weekend would, in five years time, remove the burden of today\u2019s bank woes from the backs of taxpayers and dump them right back from where they came. If the troubled-securities bought by the Treasury Department aren\u2019t worth what the Treasury paid for them, the president must submit a plan to use new taxes to recover the government\u2019s losses from the finance industry. With so many demanding a pound of flesh from the big banks, lawmakers may just be pushing Wall Street\u2019s medicine five years down the road. But that\u2019s a worry for the Class of 2015.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Skin Deep | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>There is a certain post-structuralist vibration to this modern political climate of spin wars and smear campaigns; operatives on both sides of the aisle seem to share\u2014have been forced to share\u2014the belief that \u2018truth\u2019 is an abstraction, and that discourse, true or false, governs all. Yet, for all the Foucauldian interventions of the candidates\u2019 various \u00e9minences grises, there remains a definite dimension of political campaigns that remains out of any advisor\u2019s control\u2014not because it is lofty and glacial, like the collective cultural sentiment across Texas or Ohio, but because it is written onto the candidates\u2019 faces themselves, as superficial and meaningless as a silicone bracelet.\n<br><br>Take, for example, Friday\u2019s debate. Much parsing has trailed after the event: as the media prognosticates the exchange\u2019s potential effects, Sen. John McCain has shown his post-Machiavellian stripes by naming any \u2018tie\u2019 declared an effective win for his camp. Meanwhile, a USA Today/Gallup poll declared Saturday that 46 percent of viewers thought Obama had won, while only 34 percent had sided with the Republican\u2014there goes McCain\u2019s audacious proclamation.\n<br><br>This may spring from political bias, but I tend to think McCain did far worse than he could even imagine, all before opening his mouth. I watched the debate distractedly and intermittently (as, I imagine, many American voters did), and thus my conclusion about the affair could only be an aesthetic one: that Barack Obama looks ready to lead, no matter what his opponent\u2019s ads might say, and that John McCain looks like a tired old crank.\n<br><br>It might be tempting to label this low level of analysis as a debasement of the ongoing political dialogue in this country, for its ignorance of practical policy standpoints and cultural dynamics. However, there is a growing body of research that suggests much of voting preference is, like amour fou, deaf, dumb and hopelessly impulsive.\n<br><br>Of particular interest is a 2005 psychology paper published in Science by Alexander Todorov of Princeton and his colleagues, which concludes that \u201crapid, unreflective trait inferences can contribute to voting choices,\u201d rather than deliberative reasoning. In trials the researchers vindicated their hypothesis: Almost 72 percent of Senate race outcomes were successfully predicted simply by showing a sample of the electorate pictures of the candidates for whom they could vote for milliseconds at a time, and asking them to make snap judgments on those candidates\u2019 competence. \n<br><br>At first this seems like spiriting news for the Democrats, who\u2014it may seem cruel to say\u2014have picked the far more winsome White House aspirant in 2008. There were moments on Friday night when, as a pasty and weary Sen. McCain ground out a response to one of Jim Lehrer\u2019s probing questions, that Obama seemed to be filming a future episode of The West Wing in the background: smiling genuinely and looking with a true statesman\u2019s curiosity at his rival. You half-expected the Democrat to start juggling chairs or audience members while the dollop of cottage cheese from Sedona stumbled through \u201cAhmadinejad.\u201d\n<br><br>But it\u2019s not so simple as that, says Todorov. The findings in Science suggest that attractiveness, likeability, and the appearance of trustworthiness play a negligible role in the instantaneous decisions we make about our future leaders. In the end, they suggest, the countenance of competence is all that matters. The hypothesis is heartening\u2014that, even subconsciously, our eyes return to a genuine, if superficial, appraisal of \u2018readiness\u2019\u2014but could certainly tip the \u2018shallow campaign\u2019 back towards white-haired Sen. McCain and his \u2018hot\u2019 campaign mate.\n<br><br>Of course, Obama has another, equally arbitrary and more dismaying variable about which to worry: the so-called Bradley effect. The thinking is that white voters might consciously or unconsciously conceal latent racial biases from pollsters, but be swayed by those biases  in the booth. These days I\u2019d like to think Obama is Kennedy to McCain\u2019s Nixon, the handsome and clever candidate of the future. But there\u2019s no guarantee he won\u2019t be Jesse Jackson to McCain\u2019s Michael Dukakis.\n<br><br>This isn\u2019t a condemnation of American voters; I imagine these rules have governed electoral politics since democracy was first devised millennia ago. Indeed, I\u2019d guess that this present electorate is as well informed about the lives and leanings of their candidates as any ever before. But as we forge ahead, worrying about global war and the \u2018second Holocaust\u2019 indelicately conjured by Sen. McCain, we should keep in mind that much of our decision-making process is far less grandiose than it may seem, that instead rests upon a blink and a synapse fired.\n<br><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">James M.

Clair \u201909 who is the president of the Black Pre-Law Association. It shows that people are intrigued not just because of the historical significance.\u201d\r\n<br><br>The debate was the first to include a black candidate of a major political party, and took place at the University of Mississippi, which nearly 46 years ago to the day was the site of a contentious struggle for desegregation.\r\n<br><br>On Sept. 30, 1962, one black student, James Meredith, was escorted through a sea of angry students by Federal Marshals as he walked through campus to register at the law school. Today a statue of Meredith stands prominently on the main campus to commemorate the civil rights struggle.\r\n<br><br>But on Friday, the historic moment passed unmentioned as Senators John McCain and Barack Obama eased their way into a debate that pundits termed competitive but unlikely to be game-changing. \r\n<br><br>The scheduled topic was foreign policy and national security, but for more than a third of the event the candidates argued over the issue of the day: the crisis on Wall Street and the broader issue of the economy.\r\n<br><br>The debate\u2019s moderator, Jim Lehrer of PBS, forcefully prodded the presidential hopefuls to embrace the free flowing debate format that would allow them to spar directly with one another.\r\n<br><br>The Penthouse at Hilles murmured anxiously when the candidates were asked about the $700 billion bailout plan currently being debated on Capitol Hill. \r\n<br><br>Students criticized both candidates for avoiding answering questions directly.\r\n<br><br>\u201cHe never answers the question, he always bypasses it,\u201d Amarachi C. Eseonu \u201911 said of McCain.\r\n<br><br>A few minutes later, when Obama was asked what he would be willing to give up on his presidential agenda due to the cost of the bailout, Keara D. Cormier \u201911 commented: \u201cI wish he would actually say what he was going to give up.\u201d\r\n<br><br>The audience was largely subdued, as a consistent buzz of conversation was punctuated by outbursts of laughter. Highlights included Obama\u2019s mistaken reference to McCain as \u201cTom,\u201d and McCain\u2019s quip that Obama must find it \u201chard to reach across the aisle from that far to the left.\u201d\r\n<br><br>When asked who they thought won the debate, Adrienne K. Rosenberg \u201911 was slow to offer a definitive answer.\r\n<br><br>Rosenberg said that it seemed like Obama connected better with independent voters based on CNN\u2019s tracking tool that graphed the positive and negative reactions of a focus group as the candidates spoke.\r\n<br><br>By most accounts, both candidates gave their strongest debate performances of this election, setting the stage for next week\u2019s vice presidential debate and the final two presidential debates, which will take place on Oct. 7 and 15. \r\n<br><br>\u201cThere were a lot of people saying \u2018I haven\u2019t decided yet,\u2019\u201d Rosenberg said of undecided voters on her canvassing trip to the New Hampshire last week. \u201cThe debates do matter\u2014the way that [the candidates] respond matters.\u201d\r\n<br><br>\u2014Staff writer Katherine A.

Tullo \u201912, who caught the debate at the Institute of Politics. \u201cObama was more logical and McCain used lots of one liners, but at the end he was very passionate.\u201d\r<br><br>Many of the gatherings were packed to the door, and at the IOP\u2014where the John F. Kennedy, Jr. Forum was filled to capacity\u2014students dropping by late were met with locked doors.\r<br><br>Freshmen crowded into the Wigglesworth common room, leaving little room even to stand. Upwards of 100 students gathered at the Student Organization Center at Hilles as part of an event put on by the Black Students Association. And, of course, dorm and House televisions across campus were tuned in.\r<br><br>While this contest will be the first time that most undergraduates can vote in a presidential election, some students said that they have never witnessed a fair election period. Before the candidates took the podiums, a student from Ethiopia, Ammanuel G. Gebeyehu \u201912, explained, \u201cI actually want to know how these people handle pressure. I\u2019ve never seen democracy before.\u201d\r<br><br>Even though he won\u2019t be able to vote on Nov. 4, Gebeyehu is serving as the Thayer Hall captain of the Harvard Voter Outreach and Turnout Effort, putting him in charge of making sure the dorm\u2019s residents are registered to vote.\r<br><br>The debate, held at the University of Mississippi, was initially supposed to focus on issues of foreign policy, but the host, Jim Lehrer of PBS, took the first portion of the debate in the direction of economic issues due to the recent financial crisis.\r<br><br>The discussion covered a range of issues of interest to Harvard students. As the debate was beginning, Kimberly N. Foster \u201911, who watched at the SOCH, said, \u201cI think the war question is always really interesting. John McCain is always portrayed as a warmonger, so I\u2019m curious about how well he will respond.\u201d \r<br><br>In addition to addressing the war in Iraq, the candidates discussed their proposed policies and attitudes toward North Korea, Iran, and Russia. \r<br><br>Students like Tullo said they were skeptical of some of the debate\u2019s more gimmicky moments, such as the ballpoint pen McCain produced to prove he would cut down the budget and the bracelet show-and-tell both candidates engaged in to demonstrate their support for the troops. \r<br><br>Despite instances like these that provided for comedy show fodder, severanl students said that they learned a little more about the two candidates, and said they looked forward to the two more presidential debates and the upcoming vice-presidential debate on Thursday.\r<br><br></span></p>"}
{"title": "Ne-Yo | Arts | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Once, Ne-Yo was a dude\u2019s dude. Insofar as is possible for any falsetto-reliant R&amp;B balladeer, he was a bro. He betrayed his inner wag on his sex-crazed second solo album, 2007\u2019s \u201cBecause of You,\u201d unabashedly playing the field with no regard for female feelings. When Ghostface Killah needed fraternal solidarity on \u201cFishscale\u201d single \u201cBack Like That,\u201d Ne-Yo was there to help him admonish his unfaithful paramour (while what Ghost had done was undoubtedly whack, playing him was surely no way to get him back). Plus, long before Elton John ever donned his wacky glasses to shill for Hillary, Ne-Yo was playing Obama fundraisers. The politicking made sense, since Ne-Yo always had an interest in pressing the flesh with the proverbial hos\u2014but more importantly, he always had his bros covered.\r<br><br>But no longer. Don\u2019t be fooled by the title of his latest solo album, \u201cThe Year of the Gentleman;\u201d Neo Ne-Yo\u2019s for the ladies.\r<br><br>\u201cShe\u2019s so much better than me / I\u2019m so unworthy of her!\u201d goes the lament on \u201cWhy Does She Stay.\u201d And while he once wasn\u2019t above telling the ladies to look in their girlfriend\u2019s purses for his number, this song reveals a Ne-Yo who\u2019s wracked with guilt over\u2014no joke\u2014not doing the dishes. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta be a better man for her,\u201d he sobs.\r<br><br>Okay, so he doesn\u2019t sob\u2014but throughout \u201cGentleman,\u201d it\u2019s clear that Ne-Yo\u2019s feeling a little down, a little vulnerable. On \u201cLie to Me,\u201d he can\u2019t even stomach the thought of hearing about his lover\u2019s infidelities. \u201cI don\u2019t want to know what I know to be true / What I need you to do / Tell me another lie.\u201d It doesn\u2019t sound like the Ne-Yo of \u201cBack Like That.\u201d Hell, it doesn\u2019t even sound like the Ne-Yo that graciously gave \u201cIrreplaceable\u201d up so B\u00e9yonce could trod all over her man (and while we\u2019re at it: c\u2019mon, man, that\u2019s another bro-no!). Maybe his girl\u2019s keeping his man-bits in her handbag. \r<br><br>The production\u2014for which Ne-Yo and Stargate are in large part responsible\u2014could also use some cajones.  Closer \u201cStop the World\u201d is the only track that dares to throw unexpected chord changes in the mix; the rest mostly rely on multi-tracked harmonies and the 808/acoustic guitar schema from \u201cIrreplaceable.\u201d And they\u2019re almost all somnolent, sad-sack ballads, too.\r<br><br>Polow da Don contributes single \u201cSingle,\u201d during which Ne-Yo comforts the jilted women of the nightclub. \u201cIt don\u2019t matter \u2019cause you\u2019re here now / And the music you\u2019re enjoying / So for the next couple minutes / Baby I\u2019ma be your boyfriend,\u201d he sings. What a mensch! If he only he weren\u2019t such a lazy writer.\r<br><br>Of course, it\u2019s cool that he wants to make women happy and occasionally empower them; the problem is there\u2019s none of the complexity that made his previous albums surprisingly good. The playful dashes of D\u2019Angelo are gone; the raunchy blemishes are smoothed out, and the album, unfortunately, is boy-band boring. \r<br><br>On \u201cMiss Independent,\u201d Ne-Yo sketches out a workplace dalliance\u2014the video definitely speaks to a bit of sexual harrassment\u2014between himself and a sexily self-actuated co-worker. \u201cShe work like the boss / Play like the boss / Car and a crib / She bout to pay \u2019em both off.\u201d Ne-Yo\u2019s you-go-girl rhetoric sounds patronizing, especially given the womanizing tone his previous albums took, but it permeates the whole album. Maybe he\u2019s genuinely turned on by the fact that his boss has a financial manager. \r<br><br>There was a time when I wanted to throw back some brews and watch football with Ne-Yo, but now it seems like he\u2019d be much more interested in extolling the virtues of hockey moms. In fact, Ne-Yo\u2019s early allegiance to Obama over Clinton seems retroactively unlikely\u2014at any rate, Palin\u2019s extensive leadership experience is probably making McCain look pretty enticing to Ne-Yo right now.\r<br><br>\u2014Reviewer Jake G.

Like all fetishes, it has its origins in some formative event: the rise and fall of Clintonian politics.<br><br>In 1992, a newly aggressive stance in Democratic campaigning made the party\u2019s future seem rosy. Bill Clinton\u2019s electoral victory had begun to transcend the political map of the post-Civil Rights South. After 12 years of Republican rule and alongside a solidly Democratic Congress, the new administration promised something resembling a new consensus, one that would finally recapture the ideal of an active and charitable government, delivering on healthcare, union rights, and equal pay.<br><br>Then came Don\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell and Hillarycare. Then the Contract with America and the \u201994 midterms. Then two government shutdowns. Then Monica Lewinsky. And then, and then, and then.<br><br>By 1999, Democrats had been out-bullied by a Republican political machine capitalizing on the very same Culture War issues that led Reagan and Bush to victory in \u201984 and \u201988. Even worse, the GOP had pummeled into submission a man who handled those Culture War arguments so well in the \u201992 campaign, ushering in \u201cwar room\u201d tactics that stayed with the Democrats for more than a decade. And worst of all, with Al Gore as the party\u2019s new standard-bearer, it seemed like the GOP might be able to win the ultimate contest this time around.<br><br>For many Democrats, the logical conclusion was that only bullying could answer bullying: substance is great, the thought went, but bite is best. Since then, Dems have gone through two losing presidential campaigns and one Swift Boat political ad disaster, all of which seemed to hammer the point home: Democrats just weren\u2019t being tough enough. The advice keeps cropping up this election cycle.  <br><br>This week\u2019s New York Times op-ed page proves the point, featuring an encounter between fictional President Josiah Bartlet of \u201cThe West Wing\u201d and Barack Obama. The take-away message from this  fresh batch of political onanism, in which Obama begs Bartlet for advice?  \u201cGET ANGRIER!\u201d<br><br>Reformed Reagan-era conservative Arianna Huffington takes Bartlet\u2019s advice to heart in \u201cRight is Wrong.\u201d In her disdain for namby-pamby liberalism, Huffington almost dismisses Democrats\u2019 recapture of the House and Senate in \u201906 as happenstance, chanced upon because \u201cthe positions they campaigned on are in line with mainstream America.\u201d Instead of counting their blessings for what went right, she says, Democrats should focus on what could have gone wrong and brace for the struggle the \u201908 race is likely to be. \u201cSo far,\u201d Huffington writes, liberals \u201chave shown little stomach for that fight.\u201d<br><br>So Huffington \u201cgoes on the offensive\u201d for them. And oh, what an offensive.  Within the first chapter, she invokes Orwell, dubs the George W. Bush administration a \u201cMurderers\u2019 Row of lethal bat-swingers,\u201d and speaks of an enduring Dick Cheney fantasy involving nuclear terrorism against civilian targets. She describes waterboarding as \u201cdrowning rational thought.\u201d She gives Sen. James Inhofe (R-OK) the title of \u201cDumbest Senator\u201d and harps on the \u201ccrotch-hugging flight suit\u201d Bush wore during his \u201cMission Accomplished speech.\u201d She prints page after page of bolded names and events from the Bush years in block capitals, underscored by the words, \u201cHad Enough Yet?\u201d<br><br>The catty invective suffuses every point Huffington makes; it\u2019s a variety of relentless character assassination that, as Hillary Clinton reminded America this year, is a signature of Clintonian politics. But the problem is, that\u2019s all it is: character assassination. Despite its best efforts, it doesn\u2019t emphasize the horrors of the past eight years, from torture to rampant war to widespread mismanagement and the gutting of civil liberties. Instead, it caricatures the people who put those policies in place and neglects the arguments\u2014some of them convincing\u2014that made those policies possible.<br><br>This is the reality Clintonian politics never understood: many on the other side of the political divide aren\u2019t rabid partisans. They\u2019re citizens genuinely concerned about the best way to run the country, and they find plausible answers coming from both political parties.  When deciding on their vote, they\u2019re loth to listen to demagoguery. When they err, they\u2019re likely to turn away from those who belittle their error.    <br><br>To Huffington, it may be clear that the issues of the day \u201csimply do not have two sides.\u201d To that fraction of the electorate that has swung Republican in the last two presidential elections, things aren\u2019t so certain. Mocking or ignoring that uncertainty\u2014rather than arguing forcefully against it, as Bill Clinton did 16 years ago\u2014is usually neither a winning strategy nor an honorable one, and those who use it are as likely to drive voters from the polls as earn their votes. Candy for the partisan base draws readers to The Huffington Post, but it is not, on its own, an electoral strategy.<br><br>As Bartlet said in one \u201cWest Wing\u201d episode, the President of the United States is not just \u201cthe President of the people who agree with me.\u201d And if you\u2019re not one of those people off the bat, then, as Bill Clinton put it, \u201cyou better vote for the person who wants you to think and hope.\u201d<br><br>\u2014Staff writer Nicholas K.

Republicans see this as putting \u201ccountry first\u201d\u2014we see it as a political stunt. <br>The image of McCain valiantly running to the rescue on a white horse is certainly the fairy tale he hopes to conjure, but, as any child past the age of 10 knows, fairy tales are hardly reality. One senator will not be the savior of the US economic situation\u2014and certainly not John McCain. The crisis on Wall Street and the ensuing scramble in Washington mark a grave turning point in American history, but an opportunistic McCain is hijacking the moment for no more than his own slimy political gain. <br><br>For a presidential candidate to suspend his campaign (or purport to) at the height of the election season can only be a gimmick. While McCain may have canceled his public events, the wheels of the McCain advertising machine continue to turn in several states; McCain has done nothing to stop campaign commercials on national cable that have already been cued up or radio advertisements in Florida, for instance. For a self-avowed \u201cmaverick,\u201d McCain is proving despicably adept at playing the game of underhanded politics.<br>Moreover, this is just the latest in a string of troubling leadership decisions McCain has made. His campaign has been one of the most reactionary in memory, with a series of events highlighted by the political \u201cHail Mary\u201d choice of Governor Sarah Palin as his running mate. There seems to be an epidemic of, \u201cOoh, wouldn\u2019t it be cool if\u2026\u201d running through the McCain camp, but this is no way to govern. Presidential decisions must be made with careful consideration of consequences and public reaction. McCain\u2019s antics had the foresight for neither.<br><br>With a war in Iraq, climate-change crisis, and failing public schools, the next president will face challenges on all fronts. It is a crucial part of the executive\u2019s charge to be able to multitask\u2014or, if need be, delegate to those with the expertise to address the problems at hand. As Senator Barack Obama has constantly reminded the world, McCain has said that economics \u201cis not something I\u2019ve understood as well as I should.\u201d Senator Chris Dodd and Congressman Barney Frank \u201962 are the chairs of the finance committees in their respective legislative chambers. They, along with President Bush\u2019s economic team, have the know-how and can-do attitudes to engineer a substantive bailout bill\u2014without McCain\u2019s help. Perhaps the esteemed senator from Arizona should let the experts do their jobs.<br><br>Indeed, McCain\u2019s involvement has only worsened the situation\u2014which doesn\u2019t exactly need the extra obstacles. In this case, presidential politics has proven a poison in an environment that has so far featured some miraculous bipartisanship. America has seen partisan bickering get in the way of real issues before. The current debate has no place in Washington; instead, bring it to Mississippi! <br><br>McCain should have stuck to his commitment to debate Obama and help Americans make an informed decision in November\u2014not jumped into a delicate political entanglement in Washington. His ploy\u2014which will only throw Capitol Hill into chaos and disrupt both parties\u2019 election process\u2014does little to put \u201ccountry first.\u201d We can only hope that Americans will see through these shenanigans for the sorry stunt they are.<br><br></span></p>"}
{"title": "Hank Paulson: CEO of America | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>When crisis strikes, it has often been Congress\u2019s knee-jerk reaction to accept whatever the executive branch has to offer. The Patriot Act and the Iraq War are a couple of recent examples, and the trend continues today. The current financial crisis is an issue that strikes at the hearts\u2014and pocketbooks\u2014of every American, and is sending Congress into panic mode again. It seems that few predicted a worsening crisis after the subprime bubble months ago, listening to President George W. Bush\u2019s serene conviction that everything was going smoothly, and Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson\u2019s repeated assurances that, \u201cIt\u2019s a safe banking system, a sound banking system. Our regulators are on top of it. This is a very manageable situation.\u201d \n<br><br>Now, the secret is exposed. The American economy is facing a crisis unprecedented in modern times only by the Great Depression. Secretary Paulson is demanding our trust along with a $700 billion check\u2014we should give him neither. It is illogical and rash to grant Paulson $700 billion when he was unable to prevent the crisis in the first place, or even to sense it was coming. As a guardian of the American economy in one of the highest offices in the nation, he has failed at his post. Some might argue that the economic factors leading to this crisis are difficult to control or predict, but that is not the case. President Bush admitted in his September 24 address to the nation that \u201cmost economists agree that the problems we are witnessing today developed over a long period of time.\u201d Last week, Dean of Harvard Business School Jay O. Light called the crisis a \u201cslow-motion train wreck,\u201d implying it had been a long time in coming. With these sorts of opinions about the economy, it\u2019s troubling that Paulson did not have such foresight. A Secretary of the Treasury who is unable to notice or acknowledge the symptoms of the crash should not be given an enormous sum to attempt to set us on track. It\u2019s not surprising that his bailout solution is unpopular among economists and, according to polls, the American public. In a recent poll, 55 percent of Americans indicated that they do not favor bailing out private companies using taxpayers\u2019 money, which is what this $700 billion purchase of mortgage-backed securities composes. Investors George Soros, Carl Icahn, and Jim Rogers, as well as about 200 university economists\u2014including several from Harvard\u2014are a handful of those who have vocally denounced Paulson\u2019s bailout plan. Possibly more disturbing than the economic flaws of the program are the ethical issues. As the former CEO of Goldman Sachs, Paulson has a conflict of interest. It seems that it would be really difficult for Paulson\u2014or anyone given control of $700 billion\u2014to resist helping out his former business buddies. Not surprisingly, Goldman Sachs has much to gain under the plan. If none of these reasons send out warning bells to Americans, the proposed freedom from review for Paulson\u2019s $700 billion should. As former chairman of the Harvard economics department Oliver Hart stated, \u201cWe\u2019re meant to trust the Treasury to enact this plan in a reasonable manner, but they want a carte blanche, and this is worrying.\u201d It is worrying, and suspicious. In wording reminiscent of the Patriot Act, Section 8 of the bill states, \u201cDecisions by the Secretary pursuant to the authority of this Act are non-reviewable and committed to agency discretion, and may not be reviewed by any court of law or any administrative agency.\u201d In a refreshing act of bipartisanship, both presidential hopefuls have strong reservations about this part of Paulson\u2019s plan. Senator Barack Obama said, \u201cGiven the breach of trust we have seen and the magnitude of the taxpayer money involved, there can be no blank check.\u201d In a surprising divergence from President Bush\u2019s sentiments, Senator John McCain proclaimed, \u201cNever before in the history of our nation has so much power and money been concentrated in the hands of one person.\u201d In a way, President Bush is correct when he puts the burden on Congress to act. But, it should act on the American people\u2019s interest and not Paulson\u2019s. To Congress\u2019s credit, it proposed some limitations on Paulson\u2019s power in the plan. That said, these modifications were not adequate to make up for the many flaws of the bill. For example, there were proposed modifications by Congress to give the money in smaller installments, beginning with $250 billion, still a monumental sum. For a hasty plan to fix the economy with $700 billion of US taxpayers\u2019 money, this was a hasty modification on Congress\u2019s part. Congress should not be afraid to reject Paulson\u2019s flawed plan, as they fortunately have just done in a close 228 to 205 vote. This highlights Paulson\u2019s incompetence to fix an economy that floundered under his oversight. Risking $700 billion and potentially over a trillion dollars of taxpayer money is enough incentive to act against the plan.\n<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Nafees A.

{"title": "Alumni Org Calls For Return Of ROTC  | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Citing support from both major presidential candidates, a conservative alumni organization called for the return of the Reserve Officer Training Corps to Harvard and four other universities in letters to the schools\u2019 governing boards last week. <br><br>The letter, sent by the American Council of Trustees and Alumni, quoted Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama endorsing ROTC training on college campuses. <br><br>\u201cThe notion that young people\u2014here at Columbia or anywhere in any university\u2014aren\u2019t offered the choice, the option of participating in military service, I think is a mistake,\u201d Obama said at the ServiceNation presidential forum hosted by Columbia earlier this month. <br><br>The letter appears unlikely to change Harvard\u2019s policy toward ROTC, which was banned from campus in 1969 amid anti-military sentiment during the Vietnam War. ROTC has since been blocked from returning due to the military\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy, which bars openly gay men and women from military service. <br><br>Harvard students who participate in ROTC do so through MIT but do not receive any academic credit at Harvard. <br><br>\u201cThere aren\u2019t any current plans to reconsider the current arrangement,\u201d said University spokesman John D. Longbrake. <br><br>ACTA President Anne D. Neal \u201977 said she hoped members of the Harvard Corporation, the University\u2019s chief governing board, would reconsider their stance in light of the candidates\u2019 comments. <br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s noteworthy that both major candidates feel that having ROTC on campus is a matter of student choice and equity,\u201d she said. \u201cInstitutions should take up this issue.\u201d <br><br>But Paul E. Mawn \u201963, the chairman of Advocates for Harvard ROTC and a retired Navy captain, said in an interview yesterday that ACTA \u201cmay not understand what the realistic target is\u201d and that the goal should be official recognition by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, not the opening of a ROTC branch at Harvard. <br><br>\u201cThe reality is that there are so few students at ROTC anyway, so tomorrow if Harvard begged and pleaded the Pentagon to bring it back on campus, they wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Mawn said. \u201cWhat has evolved around the country is core sites like MIT that service several different schools. MIT has the critical mass and good facilities and classrooms for the courses and drilling and other activities. There is no critical mass at Harvard.\u201d <br><br>Mawn added that he would rather see the Faculty officially recognize ROTC by sending the money it receives from ROTC scholarships\u2014an amount that totals in the hundreds of thousands of dollars\u2014to MIT to pay for overhead and other costs. He noted that Harvard used to make the payments but cut them off in the early 1990s. Since then, a group of alumni have been giving money to MIT to cover the administrative costs. <br><br>Harvard students interviewed yesterday were split on the issue of whether ROTC should be allowed to return to campus. <br><br>\u201cI can understand why Harvard would feel that way,\u201d said Aaron R. Scherer \u201911, an ROTC cadet. \u201cBut it just makes it really inconvenient for the students who have to do ROTC.\u201d <br><br>Despite Obama\u2019s stance, Harvard College Democrats President Jarret A. Zafran \u201909 said he would continue to support keeping ROTC off-campus unless the \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy\u2014which bars openly-gay soldiers from serving openly\u2014is revoked. <br><br>\u201cIt has no place on Harvard\u2019s campus,\u201d Zafran said. \u201c\u2018Don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u2019 is a discriminatory policy. I don\u2019t think that [Obama] would disagree with our anti-discrimination policy.\u201d <br><br>Harvard Republican Club President Colin J. Motley \u201910 agreed that \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d is discriminatory but said Harvard\u2019s rules unjustly punish the military for a policy enacted by the U.S. Congress and should be changed. <br><br>\u201cI think it shows how far out of the mainstream Harvard is on this issue when it has strong support from members of both parties,\u201d Motley said. <br><br>The other schools that were sent the ACTA letter are Yale, Stanford, Brown, and Columbia, according to Neal. <br><br>Neal said that none of the schools have responded yet, but the presidential candidates\u2019 comments at the forum have already sparked debate on the issue at Columbia, according to The Columbia Spectator. <br><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\u2014Paras D.

John McCain\u2019s running mate Sarah Palin has gained publicity for her notoriety on Internet blogs, in addition to her political positions, the 48 freshmen running for the eight seats on the Undergraduate Council have also been mixing campaigning with Internet renown.\n<br><br>These freshmen are making lots of promises this year, while a couple candidates\u2019 platforms have been overshadowed by their Internet operations.\n<br><br>Though having been on campus for less than a month, freshman candidates are already calling for changes to Harvard and making promises for the future during this election, which runs until noon tomorrow. \n<br><br>The majority of the candidates created Facebook groups to garner support and promote their platforms, many of which promise improvements to Harvard\u2019s facilities. Many are calling for dorms with cable television, common rooms with plasma televisions, and even sidewalks that aren\u2019t covered in puddles when it rains. Food is also a popular topic, with many UC-hopefuls calling for extended brain breaks, longer dining hall hours, and more options for spending Crimson Cash.\n<br><br>Other candidates, including Stanley G. Zheng \u201912 and Vijay Kedar \u201912 of the South Yard, are taking more unusual stances by promising to push for late-night swipe access to Yard gates and the creation of an efficient rating system for Teaching Fellows.\n<br><br>Other ambitious platforms advocate lower tuition and a change in how Harvard distributes its funds.\n<br><br>\u201cWhy are Harvard students still paying tuition when Harvard is seeing multibillion-dollar returns on its endowment?\u201d asks the Facebook group page for Edward \u201cNed\u201d L. Monahan \u201912. The Facebook platform for Seth A. Pearce \u201912 proposes \u201cStudent oversight on Harvard\u2019s investments and shareholder votes,\u201d as well as \u201csupporting not only students, but also Harvard employees, and the residents of Cambridge and Allston-Brighton.\u201d\n<br><br>Other platforms take a less serious approach. George X. Huang \u201912 is making promises to build an adult-sized playground on campus. \u201cThis is very ambitious,\u201d his Facebook site acknowledges, \u201cbut a preliminary goal of 10-15 swing sets would be fantastic, even in winter.\u201d In addition, he proposes a \u201cbunny breeding\u201d program to increase the presence of the furry animals on campus. The Facebook group for Agnes Z. Dardas \u201912 says that she is \u201cconsidering\u201d advocating for a snow cone machine.\n<br><br>INTERNET GOSSIP\n<br><br>Other candidates\u2019s Internet reputations loom larger-than-life over these platform issues.\n<br><br>Christopher A. Ballesteros \u201912 discovered, before even arriving on campus, how easily his Internet activity could become public. \n<br><br>Ballesteros announced his candidacy via Facebook in August. Soon after, his messages, which unknowingly came well before the beginning of the legal UC campaign season on Sunday, were reported to the Election Commission\u2014the seven-member body charged with publicizing elections, monitoring campaign spending, and making and enforcing the rules that campaigns must follow.\n<br><br>The Commission eventually punished him by shortening his campaign by one day.\n<br><br>The sensational, anonymous Harvard blog Gossip Geek, which publishes usually-fake gossip about campus \u201ccelebrities\u201d along with blurry photographs that allegedly feature them, broke the story by calling Ballesteros out on the early campaigning. They compared Ballesteros to Barack Obama, a Filipino boxer, and Ron Paul, by turns calling him \u201cdreamy\u201d and a \u201cshady character.\u201d The blog called his campaign violation a \u201cscandal,\u201d made fun of his Facebook group\u2019s promises, and linked to a video of him appearing on his local television station.\n<br><br>Gossip Geek posted an attack ad on Ballesteros yesterday, alleging that he wants to expand the UC while taxing alcohol. (Neither is true.) At the same time, the site has endorsed him in the South Yard race. \n<br><br>\u201cI think we did him a great service,\u201d an unnamed Gossip Geek correspondent wrote in an e-mail on Tuesday night. \u201cHis name recognition has skyrocketed, and that can\u2019t hurt for a UC hopeful.\u201d\n<br><br>Ballesteros said on Monday that the Gossip Geek coverage has been \u201chilarious.\u201d\n<br><br>But, he added, \u201cnot many freshmen have heard of Gossip Geek.\u201d\n<br><br>Ballesteros\u2019 roommate, Luis A. Martinez, Jr. \u201912, also achieved Internet notoriety over the summer for his own UC campaign. Martinez was the subject of two posts on Gossip Geek as well. \n<br><br>Martinez is also the chief administrator of the \u201cHarvard Class of 2012\u201d Facebook group, which has 1,470 members. Not related to his UC campaign, Martinez sent reminders to group members about Harvard forms due before the beginning of school year.\n<br><br>\u201cThere\u2019s not even infamy or fame associated with [the Facebook group],\u201d Martinez said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that people tend to know who I am.\u201d He said that the first thing one Kenyan freshman did when he arrived in the United States was to call Luis, whose Facebook profile lists his cell phone number, for lessons on American culture.\n<br><br>Martinez said he doesn\u2019t think his Facebook fame will influence the UC election. \u201cI don\u2019t think Facebook has really changed anything. Sure, I have a Facebook profile, but so does everyone else,\u201d he said. \u201cName recognition allows my campaign to be more relaxed. I don\u2019t feel I have to introduce myself to the public.\u201d\n<br><br>Martinez said he is running in part to meet more freshmen. \u201cThe greatest push or pull comes from door-to-door contact,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t get that through e-mail.\u201d\n<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\u2014Staff writer Alex M.

Their technique is not about distorting the debate, but rather about making it easier to understand.<br><br>\u201cAs much as we\u2019re adding things, we\u2019re also removing aspects of the broadcast so that you can concentrate on other things,\u201d Gunther said. \u201cIf you blur their faces, you hear their words in a different way. It\u2019s a fundamental perceptual shift, when you don\u2019t have the things you take for granted.\u201d<br><br>It\u2019s true: talking about the debate with friends over the next couple of days, there were points where my responses differed widely from theirs. One of Sosolimited\u2019s tricks, for instance, was to stack the candidates\u2019 answers on top of each other, lining up their most frequently used words so you could see their context. John McCain may seem to have a smoother delivery style, but it turns out that his is less fluent than Barack Obama\u2019s. McCain would often stop in the middle of a sentence or leave out a verb, while Obama\u2019s more frequent pauses were always followed up by a completely formed idea.<br><br>The software program takes care of most of the analysis, but it\u2019s up to the guys to pick out the trends that the computer identifies and to change from one program to another. All of this has enormous manipulative potential, highlighting one candidate\u2019s screw-ups and the other\u2019s shining moments. But the whole thing takes so much attention to run that they don\u2019t have time for partisan trickery.<br><br>\u201cWe\u2019re pilots,\u201d Manor said. \u201cThere\u2019s basically this enormous leviathan of controls, and we\u2019re paying no attention to the passengers. We\u2019re just trying to bring the plane in for a safe landing.\u201d<br><br>Their technique was flawless. On top of the sentence-layering program, called \u201cRemember When I Said,\u201d there was \u201cJust Face It,\u201d which zoomed in tight on each candidate and repeated the image in little dots across the screen, occasionally freezing a screen shot that would stay as the debate continued. There was also \u201cMe, You, and the Other Guy,\u201d which charted when the candidates referred to themselves, to their opponent directly, and when they referred to him in the third person. \u201cWitness Protection\u201d blurred their faces and altered their voices, and \u201cConspiracy Theory\u201d negated certain words to make you reconsider their arguments.<br><br>The crowd ate it up. The whole night was sponsored by Dewar\u2019s White Label Whiskey, and the bar downstairs probably contributed to the amount of cheering and booing that occurred during the broadcast. Sosolimited looked a little tense before things got started, but as soon as the debate was over they pulled out a bottle of the sponsor\u2019s specialty and toasted a job well done.<br><br>The trio, which formed in 2003 while its members were doing graduate work at MIT by day and clubbing by night, wanted to send a political and cultural message, but more than that, they just wanted to nerd out together.<br><br>According to Gunther, \u201cWe realized that if we put our heads together, we could really do some damage.\u201d<br><br>\u2014Staff writer Jillian J.

{"title": "Economists Advising Presidential Candidates Clash on Health Care | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Two economists who are advising the presidential candidates on health care policy discussed the merits of each candidate\u2019s plans at a debate held at the Petrie-Flom Center at Harvard Law School yesterday. \r<br><br>Economics professor David M. Cutler, a senior advisor to Democrat Barack Obama, and University of Chicago economist Tomas J. Philipson addressed the issues of high costs of health care, centralized versus privatized care, and the role that technology can play in improving health care outcomes. Both Cutler and Philipson cited affordability and accesibility as top priorities. \r<br><br>Moderated by Petrie-Flom fellow Allison K. Hoffman, the event also featured two panelists: Chicago law professor Anup Malani, who is visiting at the Petrie-Flom center, and James B. Rebitzer, a professor of health care finance at Case Western Reserve University.  \r<br><br>Cutler and Philipson each made the case for his preferred candidate\u2019s health care plans before answering questions posed by panelists and audience members. The two also gave their thoughts on the future of health care policy in light of the recent financial turmoil.\r<br><br>\u201cThis crisis highlights the need to do more,\u201d Cutler said. \u201cSenator Obama is now even more eager to deal with [health care-related] issues.\u201d\r<br><br>Philipson approached the topic more cautiously.\r<br><br>\u201cI don\u2019t think either camp has a Plan B for health care [should the bailout plan go through],\u201d Philipson said. \u201cClearly, it would favor reduced spending. But this is all hypothetical.\u201d \r<br><br>Malani, who said he had hoped to examine the details and flush out the weaknesses in both candidates\u2019 plans, spoke positively about the event afterwards.\r<br><br>\u201cI think we had some considerable success,\u201d Malani said. \u201cWe got to push back on some of the details.\u201d \r<br><br>Health care is perennially one of the most important issues in presidential campaigns. According to the Petrie-Flom center, Americans spend $2 trillion on health care annually, a cost that is expected to grow dramatically in the coming decades. \r<br><br>\u201cMore than 15 percent of our GDP is spent on health care, so it is a problem with major impacts,\u201d said Katherine E.

{"title": "Conservative Comedy: When the GOP Gets Laughs | Arts | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>When Sarah Palin was asked about Tina Fey\u2019s Memorex-quality impersonation of the GOP vice-presidential candidate, she responded that she thought it was great, but admitted that she had watched the sketch on mute. When I tried a similar tactic with the trailer for \u201cAn American Carol,\u201d David Zucker\u2019s new film parody of Michael Moore, I thoroughly enjoyed the visual likeness to the filmmaker, which seemed to me spot on. It wasn\u2019t until I reprised the trailer with sound that I realized that it was a not-so-subtle conservative \u201cspoof\u201d on liberal ideas that featured racial, religious, and sexual stereotypes and unabated nationalistic symbolism.<br><br>That viewing got me thinking about what went into conservative humor, who is considered its audience, and how it differs from a lefty approach to comedy.<br><br>You probably know writer/director David Zucker best for making \u201cAirplane!\u201d and the \u201cNaked Gun\u201d series. He has self-nominated himself as the \u201cMaster of Movie Satire.\u201d<br><br>On the surface, the trailer for \u201cAn American Carol\u201d isn\u2019t really a deviation from that of any potentially mediocre comedy: a rough plot is introduced, star power is announced in big captions, and the majority of the movie\u2019s jokes are revealed in less than three minutes. A casual once-over would divulge to the audience that Chris Farley\u2019s brother was playing the role of fat, angry, and ultraliberal \u201cMichael Malone,\u201d who is joined in his onscreen shenanigans by stars like Kelsey Grammer, Dennis Hopper, James Woods, John Voight, Trace Adkins, and Bill O\u2019Reilly. <br><br>Before you ask, \u201cWhy O\u2019Reilly?,\u201d it\u2019s important to understand something about each of the people in the above list: they all love the GOP. Woods, Grammer, and Voight were big fans of Guiliani before publicly announcing their support for McCain. Grammer was a celebrity attendee of Bush\u2019s first inauguration, and Voight makes appearances on \u201cFox and Friends\u201d and wrote an anti-Obama op-ed for the Washington Times in July. Hopper likes to donate thousands to the RNC, and Adkins is a conservative country music star. Bill O\u2019Reilly is the rule rather than the exception in this cast.<br><br>Zucker himself was, at one point, a supporter and contributor to the DNC, but he is rumored to have had a change of heart after 9/11. His most recent campaign contributions went to Giuliani\u2019s presidential campaign.<br><br>All of this political categorization would be mere speculation if it weren\u2019t for the content of the trailer. In just one minute and 44 seconds there are: two jokes disparaging homosexuals, a longer riff on Muslims, a scene in which Gary Coleman portrays a modern slave, one random shot of Trace Adkins in front of an American flag shouting \u201cThis is the greatest country in the whole wide world,\u201d one suicide bomber joke, and two ridiculous quotes from the fake Michael Moore (\u201cI love America and that\u2019s why it needs to be destroyed!\u201d and \u201cWe are gonna abolish July Fourth!\u201d).<br><br>The plot? Michael Malone decides to abolish the Fourth of July, but before he can do so, three ghosts (George Washington, General Patton, and JFK) appear to him in Dickens-like fashion to \u201cTeach him the true meaning of patriotism.\u201d<br><br>It seems clear that this film was created for a conservative audience, or if nothing else, a xenophobic, interventionalist, sexist, and racist one.<br><br>With this conservative comedy in mind, I started thinking about the \u201cliberal\u201d approach to poking fun at conservative politics and society. This election has provided a healthy portion of such media, from heavyweights like The Daily Show, The Colbert Report, and Saturday Night Live, but there\u2019s something remarkably different that sets their style apart from that of the conservatives. At the bottom of it all, what I think it comes down to is truth. More and more of John Stewart\u2019s laughs come from beautiful montages of actual video illustrating the hypocrisy of Bush, McCain, and Karl Rove, and SNL\u2019s highest ratings in years had Tina Fey portraying a Palin so true to life that even the dialogue was barely altered. <br><br>In an era when one candidate can compare another to Paris Hilton, the humor is right there in reality, and all people like Colbert have to do is repackage it on a Comedy Central platter; the laughs and good ratings follow naturally. <br><br>Though founded on pure humor and even some flat-out fabrications, shows like Colbert\u2019s and Stewart\u2019s have become an outlet for actual truth in a moment when the mainstream media can\u2019t capitalize on lies and gaffes without coming off biased. Even Letterman was scolded  for continually berating McCain for skipping his show.<br><br>Conservative humor like \u201cAn American Carol,\u201d on the other hand, makes use of much less \u201celitist rational thought\u201d and instead capitalizes on offensive, lowbrow humor while delivering a \u201cpatriotic\u201d message. <br><br>It\u2019s also interesting to note that the company \u201cAmerican\u201d enough to produce \u201cAn American Carol\u201d is called Mpower. The company\u2019s mission statement is \u201cTo engage, inspire, and empower a global audience through film and television content that promotes truth.\u201d Mpower\u2019s CEO, Steve McEveety, has produced films like \u201cThe Passion of the Christ,\u201d \u201cBraveheart,\u201d and \u201cWe Were Soldiers.\u201d Why does suddenly throwing Mel Gibson into this mix make it even scarier? <br><br>I honestly hope that \u201cAn American Carol\u201d is not the beginning of a trend because I like my truth truer than Mpower\u2019s. Most people laugh in movies because they think, \u201cYes! That is so true!\u201d And yet, I am sure that when this film gets released on October third, one month before the election, people all around the country will laugh at it and say, \u201cYes, Bill O\u2019Reilly, that is so true!\u201d If this humor based on irrational untruths, out of date stereotypes, and fear is gratifying to most Americans, then maybe we\u2019ve got bigger problems coming. <br><br>\u2014Columnist Andrew F.

{"title": "Democracy 0, Man-Bracelets 1 | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>A week after its anticlimactic finish, it\u2019s now clear that the first presidential debate was not dominated, as instant-polling results and exuberant liberal pundits have since indicated, by Barack Obama. It was also not, as his preemptive Wall Street Journal advertisement declared, a landslide for John McCain. In fact, the clear stars of the debate-that-nearly-wasn\u2019t were not running for the presidency at all. They were speech coaches, makeup artists, and, for the first time, man-bracelet manufacturers. Like all political theatre, that night belonged to the costumers, to the stage crew, to the stylists to power.\n<br><br>Speechwriters played a part, of course\u2014every folksy quip, every heart wrenching anecdote, every false accusation was delivered with the poise and monotony of long preparation on both sides. But the best moments were, as in all theatre, accidental: McCain nearly forgetting how to pronounce \u201cAhmadinejad.\u201d Obama\u2019s ludicrously blackened eyebrows. And, most of all, a stunning exchange concerning the bracelets they each wore.\n<br><br>McCain had been trotting out a black wristband from the mother of a Corporal Matthew Stanley for cheap sympathy points since August of last year. I should have seen it coming: At just the right moment and in a lowered voice, he intoned, \u201cShe said, \u2018Senator McCain, I want you to do everything\u2014promise me one thing, that you\u2019ll do everything in your power to make sure that my son\u2019s death was not in vain.\u2019\u201d\n<br><br>He continued on to recite the foreign policy arguments we knew he would. But then Obama, in a tone of exasperation, delivered his single zinger of the evening: \u201cLet me just make a point. I\u2019ve got a bracelet, too.\u201d And then he stumbled. \u201cFrom, Sergeant, uh, from the mother of, uh, Sergeant, Ryan David Jopek.\u201d\n<br><br>Diehards on conservative forums spun it as The Greatest Debate Gaffe Ever, liberal bloggers at the Daily Kos skipped over that last sentence and called it the apex of debate brilliance, and the rest of us were left with a distinct feeling of unease. Bracelets? Really?\n<br><br>In the early days of this quagmire of an election\u2014the really early days, before Giuliani\u2019s mobster connections and before Edwards\u2019 pregnant mistress\u2014I might have found this funny. We all used to laugh at all the candidates, what characters they were: the 9/11 Guy, the Crazy Libertarian, the One Who Calls Himself a Potted Plant. I used to tell people I was voting for Mike Huckabee because his weight-loss story was an inspiration to us all. Sarah Palin, nearly as cute and every bit as socially conservative, now inspires only disbelief and a vague sense of panic.\n<br><br>You see, in the intervening year that brought a brutal nomination fight, abundant scandal, and total financial collapse, I\u2019m afraid I lost my sense of humor. The notorious Paris Hilton ad is less witty when we start worrying if it was supposed to tap into racism. McCain\u2019s humble acknowledgement that \u201cthe issue of economics is not something I\u2019ve understood as well as I should\u201d is no longer cute as the investment banks of Wall Street tumble around us. And after his vice-presidential choice was reduced to incoherence by Katie Couric, even his age has ceased to work as a punch line, because he may very well die.\n<br><br>I thought the bracelet debacle was the end of it. An old man with the heady impetuousness of youth wove a tired tale, and a young man with the calmness of a Socratic law professor called him out. \u201cNo soldier dies in vain.\u201d It is patently stupid to argue about jewelry, so stupid that Obama now wears a flag pin out of resignation while McCain, whose detractors never really noticed what pin he wore, did not.\n<br><br>So I was heartened to find that even as fierce partisans across the Internet rehashed his single comment again and again, major media outlets are hardly graced it with a single mention. They have bigger things to worry about than token politics\u2014that pesky bank bailout, for instance, that McCain\u2019s cavalier intervention and the political posturing of his House Republican friends may have put beyond rescue. They have better things to worry about, and so do we.\n<br><br>Last night, we saw two vice presidential nominees with very different image problems. One, known for his experience, wit, and candor, could have ruined everything with an unfortunate sound bite. The other, whose commitment to staying on message extends to repeating things that everyone knows are lies, could have unhinged all if she were allowed to speak too long. Setting vitriol aside, the two campaigns compromised: To accommodate Joe, they set up podiums. To accommodate Sarah, they allotted less time for answers. She would speak as she does best: in sound bites.\n<br><br>We\u2019ll find out soon enough whether Biden\u2019s offensive jokes or Palin\u2019s feeble mind surrendered the ten-second clip that lost either of their more able running mates the election. But just as last week\u2019s show did nothing to advance the debate, except maybe exclude bracelets from future episodes, last night\u2019s will do no more to put voters on the path toward making the right choice. The problem remains the same: a contest in which the rules are designed to save face will give us, the voters, nothing. The worse candidate cannot lose, and the best one will not win.\n<br><br>\n<br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Elise Liu \u201911, a Crimson editorial editor, lives in Cabot House.</span></span></p>"}
{"title": "The Summer of (Lesbian) Love | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>I have never kissed a girl. Which was fine, until Katy Perry came along.\n<br><br>There is no question that Perry\u2019s pop confection \u201cI Kissed a Girl\u201d was the song of the summer\u2014love it or hate it (and many do), the Billboard Hot 100 has been tasting cherry Chapstick for 20 weeks and counting.  Even New York Magazine\u2019s imperious \u201cVulture\u201d blog had to admit the song\u2019s success, but not without threatening to move to Canada. \n<br><br>Lesbianism was on the airwaves and in the air this summer. It was a neurotic time: McCain and Obama were getting snipey, the Russian government was getting imperial, and Fannie and Freddie were getting killed. We needed something fun, something slightly dangerous, something to blow off a little steam. So we kissed a girl.\n<br><br>It started on June 16 in San Francisco, when gay rights activists Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon became the first same-sex couple married in San Francisco after the state Supreme Court overturned a 2006 judicial ban on gay marriage.  According to a report by the Williams Institute at UCLA, California officials can expect to marry well over 118,000 gay couples in the next three years. \n<br><br>If Martin and Lyon represent one end of the gay spectrum (rainbow), then Lindsay Lohan and Samantha Ronson are the other. Gawker, Perez Hilton, People.com\u2014the web\u2019s seedy scandal-mongers were obsessed with Lohan and her fedora-ed \u201cfriend.\u201d Although Lohan\u2019s mother Dina denied the relationship\u2014\u201cThey\u2019re best friends. They\u2019re just friends. It\u2019s pathetic what people say,\u201d she told the entertainment news show Extra \u2014photos showed them cooing and canoodling and looking very couple-y from New York to L.A.\n<br><br>More than that, they looked happy. Lindsay Lohan, for once, looked happy. Whether you\u2019re for or against gay marriage, you can\u2019t deny that Lohan\u2019s name has appeared far less frequently with the word \u201ccocaine\u201d since she started seeing Ronson. Between Perry\u2019s playful experimentation, California\u2019s flamboyant joy, and Lohan\u2019s newfound stability, lesbianism was suddenly the wholesome choice. It was out in the open, the Band-Aid that would hide, if not heal, the pain of a bruising couple of months.\n<br><br>In \u201cI Kissed a Girl,\u201d Perry is not proud, and she\u2019s not ashamed\u2014she\u2019s just there. \u201cI kissed a girl and I liked it.\u201d Period. And the people welcomed it. Perry performed the song on Fox\u2019s \u201cSo You Think You Can Dance,\u201d one of summer\u2019s highest-rated shows, and on NBC\u2019s middle-class morning favorite \u201cToday.\u201d There she was, prancing in hot pants before families at the breakfast table or clustered around their televisions during prime time. A few hard-line Christian groups were unhappy, but there were no high-profile grumblings or media watchdog temper tantrums. Just acceptance.\n<br><br>But the fun was hard-won, and it may not last. California, and in particular San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom, have been fighting for gay marriage since 2004, when Newsom ordered the county clerk to begin issuing licenses to same-sex couples. Martin and Lyon were the first married then, as well, but their marriage was invalidated along with 3,954 others when the state Supreme Court ruled that Newsom had overstepped his authority in ordering the licenses issued. Now, a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage comes up for a vote in November.  Women are walking down the aisle together for now, but the honeymoon could end abruptly.\n<br><br>As for LiLo, she and Samantha Ronson are engaged.  Or they aren\u2019t.  Or they want babies together.  Or she has a crush on Posh Spice.  Who knows? Dina Lohan finally acknowledged the relationship publicly in mid-September, telling Entertainment Tonight that \u201cif they are happy, I am happy. This is my child, I mean, what better place for a child to be than happy in her soul and her spirit.\u201d \n<br><br>That is, after all, what this phenomenon boils down to: what makes you happy. As ecstatic as California\u2019s gay community was in June, November may prove to be a somber affair. The economy is collapsing around us, gas prices are through the roof, and who knows what the world will look like tomorrow. Who\u2019s to begrudge a little kiss?\n<br><br>So Katy Perry kissed a girl \u2014 that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s in love tonight. She just wanted to. It made her happy.

McCain\u2019s choice of running mate was a nod to the religious right and to frustrated Hillary supporters, to be sure. But more than that, it was a concession to the contingent of American voters, growing in size and volume, who want a leader who looks, sounds and thinks like them. <br><br>Of course, Dubya was no different: That erstwhile Ivy Leaguer knew to play up his adoptive Texan roots for this very reason. And his electoral success in 2004 explains how \u2018narrative\u2019 has hijacked the race in 2008. But it seems this time the stakes have been raised for the candidates. Beyond simply seeming like \u2018authentic Americans\u2019, they also have to highlight their encounters with regular-folk adversities and hardships; these aspects of their biographies have come to supersede all foreign affairs experience or a top-flight education.<br><br>Thus, in a time when the economy is unraveling, international support is dissolving, and the average American is struggling to pay the bills, it seems that voters are still better won over by a candidate with whom they can empathize\u2014who has experienced their daughter\u2019s premature pregnancy or struggled along with the help of food stamps\u2014than by extraordinary powers of leadership or experiences. The campaigns have been more than happy to indulge this demand. Take Hillary Clinton, who, even as she insisted on her own experience, felt compelled to invent a little Bosnian sniper fire and take an uncharacteristic shot of Crown Royal, rather than use the language of the political elite she inhabits.<br><br>This tension seems most interesting in the case of Sen. Obama; after all, he has criticized politicians who play the \u201cpatriotic American\u201d card. As he writes in his latest book, The Audacity of Hope, \u201cthose in public life have become so scripted, and the gestures that candidates use to signify their values have become so standardized (a stop at a black church, the hunting trip, the visit to a NASCAR track, the reading in the kindergarten classroom)3.\u201d Obama has, he suggests, never felt the need to prove he\u2019s your typical all-American Joe: he\u2019s proud of the fact that he is comfortable asking for Dijon mustard while campaign advisors suggest he take the regular yellow kind. But he also realizes, as much as anyone, that he needs to appear a certain way to win votes\u2014that is, not as the former president of the Harvard Law Review.<br><br>The irony is that the true American story is not just about facing obstacles, but triumphing over them. It\u2019s not just about growing up in a single-parent family assisted by food stamps, but climbing the ranks at a premier law school. It\u2019s not just about having spent fives years as a prisoner of war, but rising to become a powerful senator who\u2019s spent decades in Washington. Unfortunately, though, we can\u2019t hear about the latter achievements because they alienate the candidate from the people they may one day lead. Empathy and sympathy, necessary as they are in a president, have shrunk our candidates and nipped off the interesting stories of their \u201cimprobable journeys\u201d at the very beginning.<br><br><br><br>Rachel A.

{"title": "Robinson Mischaracterizes Service | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>To the editors:\r<br><br> <br><br>In \u201cServitude Nation\u201d (Op-ed, Sept. 18), Daniel P. Robinson criticizes efforts by Senators Obama and McCain and the coalition of 114 organizations called ServiceNation to promote voluntary national and community service.  Robinson uses a series of \u201cstraw-men,\u201d challenging the legality of national service as well as the intent of those who desire to strengthen and grow the service sector. Unfortunately, Robinson recycles many tired and specious arguments. \r<br><br>Robinson suggests that we already have enough volunteering available in America. How then can you explain the fact that there are more than 3 applicants for every available AmeriCorps slot, or that Teach For America had 24,718 applicants for 3,700 positions? You can bet the residents of the Gulf Coast, Davenport, Iowa and other regions hit by national disaster wish there were more AmeriCorps members to fill the gaps left by the private sector, and FEMA, in response to natural disasters.\r<br><br>However, the crux of Robinson\u2019s argument seems to be that the purpose of \u201cnationalistic\u201d programs is \u201cnot service for its own sake, but service as a way to strengthen people\u2019s ties to their government.\u201d This is an unfortunate misconception of the entire service movement. The point of voluntary service\u2014paid or unpaid\u2014is to free citizens from reliance on government programs and solutions, provide ways for Americans to dedicate their time to helping others, and unleash citizen energy on pressing, persistent problems in education, our environment, and disaster relief. The growth of the service movement, in fact, is a reflection of the reality that big government bureaucracies haven\u2019t always been very successful or efficient. Community and national service is not just about painting over graffiti or picking up litter, but about creating pathways for citizens to help address big social challenges.\r<br><br>Even Senators McCain and Obama find room to agree on the importance of service. That is reflected in part by their recent historic agreement at the ServiceNation Presidential Forum and Summit in New York City this past September 11th and 12th to co-sponsor the new bi-partisan \u201cServe America Act\u201d with Senators Kennedy, Hatch, Dodd, Cochran, and Clinton. This new legislation will grow AmeriCorps by 175,000 corps members, strengthen and grow the Peace Corps, and create new problem solving corps in education, disaster relief, environmental protection, and other areas. Despite the negative attacks of this presidential season, it is a powerful testament to the widespread appeal of service that these two presidential rivals are co-sponsoring this ground-breaking legislation. \r<br><br> <br><br> <br><br>ETHAN L.

He is the author of a recent paean to the short story. Drawing an analogy to William Blake\u2019s \u201cworld in a grain of sand,\u201d he writes in a New York Times essay that \u201cthe short story concentrates on its grain of sand, in the fierce belief that there\u2014right there, in the palm of its hand\u2014lies the universe\u2026In that single grain of sand lies the beach that contains the grain of sand.\u201d\r\n<br><br>Millhauser is also, perhaps unbeknownst to himself, an excellent political theorist. His idea that the small moment encloses the large maps surprisingly well onto the personality pageant that is Election 2008. According to his \u201cgrain of sand\u201d model, no incident is too tiny from which to construct an overarching narrative. \r\n<br><br>Take political coverage, for instance. Candidates must take especial care when uttering anything in a public forum; the efficiency with which throwaway statements are enlarged, diagrammed, and deconstructed would do the academy proud. Barack Obama\u2019s reference in front of an Iowa crowd last year to the rising price of arugula (as opposed, one imagines, to iceberg lettuce or a nice thick T-bone) was touted by many as proof of his elitist disconnect from middle America. The official comment that John McCain was \u201caware of the Internet\u201d was neatly transfigured into an image of the Republican as an old fogey hunt-and-pecking at his dusty Underwood. \r\n<br><br>Millhauser\u2019s method was also at work onstage at last Thursday\u2019s vice-presidential debate, in which candidates attempted to distill their entire lives and political philosophies into 90-second responses.\r\n<br><br>Countering a charge that upper-class tax increases would hurt the economy, Joe Biden launched like a mad bus driver into a breathless verbal tour of his hometown, beginning with Union Street and a mom-and-pop restaurant, accelerating through all the stops\u2014the current administration, taxes, Iraq, education, health care\u2014taking a slight detour to note his (working-class, blue-collar) predilection for Home Depot, and wheezing back into the station with a promise of change from Obama. To viewers at home, Biden\u2019s brief but intimate portrait seemed to say much more than any dense policy proposal. \r\n<br><br>Sarah Palin\u2019s brief replies were similarly revealing.  Her impressive verbal architecture ensured the maximum number of catchy phrases per minute; when there\u2019s so much to say, who has time to conjugate verbs? And she did succeed in conveying her dedication (to buzzwords, if nothing else). When the moderator asked what each candidate considered to be his or her Achilles\u2019 heel, Palin assured the audience of her \u201cexperience as an executive\u201d and \u201cconnection to the heartland of America,\u201d before conceding that \u201cwe are not perfect as a nation. But together, we represent a perfect ideal. And that is democracy and tolerance and freedom and equal rights. Those things that we stand for that can be put to good use as a force for good in this world.\u201d Whether this evasion was deft or dubious, Palin\u2019s answer certainly conveyed her values.\r\n<br><br>Just as these individual moments reflect the spirit of candidates and citizens, the election itself acts as a microcosm for American society. This year\u2019s face-off, in all its minute moments, plays like the trailer to an epic film about American life, starring all the A-listers\u2014War, Economy, Race, Gender, Age, Tina Fey\u2014and distilling with surprising accuracy the issues that define our national consciousness.

{"title": "Virginia Is For Others | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>My home state of Virginia has become something of a Holy Grail for Democrats in the upcoming national election, but I fear they may be a little too sanguine about their prospects in the former Confederate capital. True, the auguries are favorable\u2014Democrats can now claim control of the state legislature, two successive governorships, and almost certainly two seats in the Senate after the retirement of the lapidary John Warner this fall.\n<br><br>But recent success on the state level can mostly be attributed to the colossal incompetence of Virginia\u2019s Republican Party, which bungled its way into grotesque budget deficits and finally turned all sensible people off with its theological crusade against the very existence of government\u2014except, of course, for the biennial gesture of a gay-marriage referendum and legislation that would force black hooligans to pull up their pants (I\u2019m not kidding).  Even Bible-thumping racists realized that the need for roads and schools superseded these otherwise noble causes.\n<br><br>Senator Jim Webb\u2014the swaggering, foul-mouthed, warrior-author and recent convert from Reaganite to renegade Democrat\u2014is widely popular among the heavy-drinking, heavy-praying Scots-Irish who populate the southwestern hill country. But even he barely defeated the disgustingly stupid, backyard-barbeque bigot George \u201cMacaca\u201d Allen in 2006, amid widespread discontent with the Bush Administration\u2019s handling of the economy and Iraq. And a Harvard-educated, cerebral crypto-Muslim is a much harder sell, especially one with an ethnically dubious name.\n<br><br>I admit that I\u2019m trading in stereotypes here, and almost certainly oversimplifying the matter. Virginia is, in a sense, a microcosmic battleground for the dreaded and dreary culture wars. I hail from the prosperous, expanding, and relatively liberal northern Virginia suburbs, which have been a huge factor in the Democrats\u2019 optimistic forecasts. In the same way Americans abroad, out of a sense of propriety, claim to be Canadians, I usually tell Cantabridgians that I\u2019m from Washington D.C. I\u2019ve never actually met any Appalachian Virginians, but I\u2019ve always assumed they were kind of inbred yokels, bitter people clinging to their guns and religion. I know they probably consider me a left-wing Jewish homosexual pornographer. (Both caricatures probably have a degree of truthiness to them.)\n<br><br>These days an elitist cabal of Democratic strategists advocates abandoning the hopelessly benighted South and other states\u2014like Ohio and Pennsylvania\u2014that are falling behind in the new economy. But any victory they might win in this way is really quite Pyrrhic from an ideological standpoint: The yuppified Democrats would abandon labor unions and economic populism altogether, marginalize civil rights, and attract middle-to-upper class whites with a boring but effective message of competent governance. This strategic shift would only ignite another culture war, one perhaps just as divisive, fueled by the Oedipal resentment of pseudo-bohemian youth against their suburbanite parents. Given the choice, I\u2019d choose the Confederate flag and NASCAR over Starbucks and league soccer.\n<br><br>Instead, I\u2019m proposing a truce in the culture war, one that may very well help Obama in his quixotic quest for Virginia\u2019s 13 electoral votes. Radically reduced federalism is the solution. If it makes me a liberal apostate, so be it, but here\u2019s my proposal: Gay marriage, guns, abortion, the death penalty, drug laws, and a host of other issues should be deferred to state governments. Many federal taxes should be contingent upon a state\u2019s desire for access to federal programs.\n<br><br>Surely, this could be called a reactionary\u2019s utopian fantasy (I prefer to think of it as an anarchist\u2019s utopian fantasy). It may also be objected that what I am actually recommending is the country\u2019s dissolution. I recall Einstein\u2019s story of a colleague who, in response to the sage scientist\u2019s fervent pleas for nuclear disarmament, quipped: \u201cWhy are you so deeply opposed to the disappearance of the human race?\u201d I\u2019ll never plunge into such depths of misanthropic despair, but I could with some degree of sincerity ask the same question about the disappearance of the United States.\n<br><br>Besides, I don\u2019t have to worry about the future of my home state, since I don\u2019t plan on living there ever again.

{"title": "Exception to the Rule | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>\u201cIn America any boy may become President and I suppose it\u2019s just one of the risks he takes.\u201d So said Adlai Stevenson in 1952\u2014rather ironically, given his failure, two times, to be nearly as well liked as Ike. Stevenson, a renowned crusader for the cause of American liberalism (if there is such a thing), may also have dated himself with this quip; this year, a half-century after it was made, not one but two \u201cgirls\u201d have drawn within practical inches of the Oval Office. <br><br>But the governor\u2019s point remains clear: Ours is an exceptional nation, for our commitment to\u2014or pretension of\u2014classless meritocracy, representative democracy in its purest, fairest form, and an undying optimism about our shared future.<br><br>Today, one of the women Stevenson infelicitously dismissed with his remark has nevertheless taken up his banner, in a very different way. Governor Sarah Palin has made much ado over her belief in America\u2019s place atop a moral-idealistic hierarchy since her nomination.<br><br>Not one week ago, at the vice-presidential debate in St. Louis, Palin responded to a question about her Achilles heel with a defense of her worldview, which \u201csays that America is a nation of exceptionalism, and we are to be a shining city on a hill, as President Reagan so beautifully said, that we are a beacon of hope and that we are unapologetic here.\u201d <br><br>This may not matter almost 400 years after the fact, but Governor and founding Bay Stater John Winthrop might have had a case in intellectual property court here. Moreover, Palin\u2019s mega-sentence is generally riddled with contradiction. Winthrop\u2019s city on a hill, at least from the abstraction of the Arbella, wasn\u2019t a place for maverickly disdain for critics outside its borders; indeed, it was envisaged as a collectivized moral paragon, a fragile, idealized community that must hold itself to its own high standards if it hopes to preserve its figurative elevation.<br><br>To be fair, Palin reined in her nationalism, if not her loopy syntax, immediately afterward; she continued, \u201cWe are not perfect as a nation. But together, we represent a perfect ideal. And that is democracy and tolerance and freedom and equal rights.\u201d So, yes, she understands that a bitter incongruity exists between American ideals and American realities\u2014that, oftentimes, the poor are rendered mute and immobile under the drone of helicopters and the careerist caution of legislators.<br><br>But still I wonder. Since that debate, Palin has gone on the attack. For example, though Obama calls America \u201cthe greatest country in the world\u201d so often you wonder if there\u2019s a string coming out of his back, Palin told donors in Colorado: \u201cOur opponent\u2026is someone who sees America, it seems, as being so imperfect, imperfect enough, that he\u2019s palling around with terrorists who would target their own country.\u201d Beyond Palin\u2019s remark being a profound distortion of the senator\u2019s relationship with former Weather Underground Organization member William Ayers, it\u2019s also a direct contradiction of her days-old concession to the exact same point: America is exceptional, but it\u2019s not perfect.<br><br>Whether Palin has changed her mind about the perfection or imperfection of the country she (sort of) lives in, or whether her debate-night modesty was merely a concession to centrists to be abandoned before a friendly throng, cases like this make you wonder about the prospective vice president\u2019s intellectual honesty. To be fair, those throngs have continued to eat her red meat, gladly; more recently, when Palin quoted Obama out of context questioning the activities of American troops in Afghanistan, a few piped up with cries of \u201ctreason\u201d; elsewhere, the response \u201ckill him!\u201d could audibly be heard. The moment the debate ended, the governor gave up totally on asking questions about how America could be, planted her feet, and antagonized anyone who doesn\u2019t like how it already is. <br><br>According to political legend, when he was told by a supporter that \u201cevery thinking man in America\u201d (they were big on the gender bias back then) was behind him, Adlai Stevenson replied, \u201cThank you, but I need a majority to win.\u201d Again, sadly, he was right\u2014this time, twice over; he lost to Ike by a landslide, and, fifty years later, White House aspirants are still appealing, with success, to blinkered self-righteousness and total thoughtlessness.<br><br><br><br>James M.

I could live with her not having a passport until 2006 \u2014you don\u2019t need a passport to hear briefings about countries, and with the economic meltdown, we have enough issues at home. I could live with her strong anti-abortion stance\u2014even if Roe v. Wade falls, plenty of states will still keep abortion legal. I could even live with the fact that she inspires strange Oedipal-like feelings in me because of her resemblance to the teacher/stripper in Varsity Blues\u2014it\u2019s just the consequence of some childhood trauma that I\u2019ve repressed. But what I can\u2019t live with is not knowing what Sarah Palin thinks about dinosaurs.<br><br>My concern probably would not have manifested itself had it not been vocalized by political pundit Matt Damon, who in an interview with Air America said, \u201cI want to know if she thinks dinosaurs were here 4,000 years ago.\u201d  Upon hearing about the interview, I was first struck by the question of what ever happened to Ben Affleck. After deciding that Reindeer Games was probably the cause of Affleck\u2019s downfall, I then began to ponder about dinosaurs. To be an informed voter, do we really need to know about Sarah Palin\u2019s opinion on dinosaurs?<br><br>The beginning of the dinosaur question seems to be a viral email with preposterous fake quotes attributed to Sarah Palin that stated that \u201cGod made dinosaurs 4,000 years ago\u201d as \u201clizards of Satan\u201d with the manifest destiny that they would die and become \u201cpetroleum products.\u201d  Bloggers and pundits quickly picked up on this and continued the buzz. The New York Times\u2019 Maureen Dowd, in a September 9 column asked, \u201cDoes she really think Adams, Eve, Satan, and the dinosaurs mingled on the earth 5,000 years ago?\u201d  Matt Damon added to the debate, and an Internet rumor was off and running.<br><br>However, this rumor is much different than some previous rumors such as Barack Obama being a Muslim or Palin banning books, which the USA Today determined to be false.  Unlike book banning or religion which you can verify with library and church records, there is no way to find out what Palin\u2019s beliefs on dinosaurs are unless she states them, which to date she hasn\u2019t. Moreover, there is reason to believe the rumors are true.<br><br>During the 2006 Alaska governor\u2019s race, Palin stated that creationism and evolution should both be taught in the classroom, but that her opinion was not to prohibit debate and that creationism \u201cdoesn\u2019t have to be part of the curriculum.\u201d<br><br>Therefore, she is undoubtedly in the league of people who believe that there can be a religious explanation for the creation of the universe. However, this is a large group, which can include everyone from Intelligent Designers, to young-earth creationists, to people who believe that God worked through the tool of evolution. The dinosaur question is important to figure out which one she is.<br><br>While George Bush and John McCain support creationism, their beliefs are much different from those espoused by young-earth creationism. Bush argues for Intelligent Design, which while flawed, concedes much to science and would never make the outrageous claim that dinosaurs and man lived together. McCain\u2019s relationship with creationism is more ambiguous. He\u2019s alternated between saying that \u201call points of view should be presented\u201d  to saying that creationism probably shouldn\u2019t be taught in science class.  This mixed record gives the impression that McCain doesn\u2019t drink the Kool-Aid  but wants the votes of those who do. But the question remains, where does Palin stand?<br><br>Rev. Howard Bess, who used to be a Baptist minister in Palmer, a small town near Wasilla, argued that she is a young-earth creationist. According to Salon.com, Bess recalled a conversation where he pushed her on whether the earth \u201cwas really less than 7,000 years old and whether dinosaurs and humans walked the earth at the same time.\u201d  According to Bess, Palin said yes to both questions.<br><br>But should we care? People believe in crazy things. In a 2004 poll, 34 percent of Americans stated that they believed in ghosts and 24 percent in witches.  Dennis Kucinich, in the 2007 Democratic debate, stated that he saw a UFO , which makes him a possible interstellar Manchurian Candidate. So why do dinosaurs matter?<br><br>Dinosaurs matter because to believe that dinosaurs walked with man, an individual must stubbornly cling to a belief despite all available evidence against it. The young-earth creationist mindset is dogmatic and anti-empirical\u2014which is a very dangerous thing to have in a leader. The current President has already demonstrated an incredible ability to at times disavow the reality that all evidence points to. At this time, when the United States is engaged in two wars and a financial crisis, to have a Vice President\u2014or President\u2014who  is detached from reality is the last thing we need.<br><br>The dinosaur question is an important issue that needs to be addressed by Palin, hopefully before the election. It turns out after all that Matt Damon did make a decent pundit. By the way, whatever happened to Ben Affleck?<br><br><br><br>Steven T. Cupps \u201909, a crimson editorial writer, is a human evolutionary biology concentrator in Lowell House. His column appears on alternate Thursdays.</span></p>"}

As the economy worsens, even more people have been taking to the streets.\r<br><br>Robert C. Reddick is one of Harvard Square\u2019s recent victims of homelessness. After years of factory work, including stints at the American Can Company and Bethlehem Steel, Reddick said he found himself out of work due to the recent sub-prime crises. \u201cI had been living with my two sisters,\u201d said Reddick. \u201cSeven months ago, things just got too hard for them, and I had to leave.\u201d\r<br><br>Since then, Reddick has been sleeping on park benches, the street, and when possible, the Pine Street Inn. \r<br><br>\u201cI\u2019m willing to work but there are no jobs. I don\u2019t know how to work a computer, but I\u2019ll wash dishes, I\u2019ll do anything,\u201d he said.\r<br><br>State Representative Alice K. Wolf, whose district includes Harvard Square, said she sympathizes with Reddick. \r<br><br>\u201cThis downturn of the economy has hit working people particularly hard,\u201d said Wolf. \r<br><br>In order to combat this epic rise in homelessness, Wolf has lobbied for appropriations for the homeless. This fiscal year\u2019s budget includes $10 million for temporary supportive housing and the organization Housing First. \r<br><br>\u201cWe\u2019re looking for long-term solutions. We want to end the cycle of inadequate funding,\u201d said Wolf. \u201cIn this way, we won\u2019t need to spend more down the line on our healthcare system and motels [where homeless people are often temporarily housed].\u201d\r<br><br>Numerous Harvard students have a firsthand view of the homeless epidemic by volunteering at the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter on 66 Winthrop St.\r<br><br>\u201cWorking at the shelter has taught me how to listen and respect people without judging them,\u201d said Eleanor R. Wilking \u201909, a senior director of the shelter. \r<br><br>When asked about the recent rise in homelessness, however, Wilking said, \u201cIt would be hard to know how many more people have been coming [due to the economic downturn], since the shelter is only open between Nov. 15 and April 15.\u201d\r<br><br>In the meantime, however, Reddick and the rest of Harvard Square\u2019s homeless population, such as David B. Murray, remain out in the October cold.\r<br><br>Murray has been homeless ever since his cousin died 3 years ago. He hawks Spare Change newspapers in the Square in order to make ends meet. \r<br><br>Although Murray works in Cambridge, he is not allowed in the shelter, due to residency restrictions. Like Reddick, he often goes to the Pine Street Inn for food and shelter.\r<br><br>\u201cThere\u2019s been no government help. It comes down to the greed of the politicians,\u201d said Murray. \u201cThis country first became owned by banks, and now government owns the banks after the bailout.\u201d\r<br><br>Cambridge Mayor E. Denise Simmons said she is more optimistic about the future of homelessness. \r<br><br>\u201cWe direct all homeless people needing assistance to the multi-service center,\u201d said Simmons. \u201cI\u2019m also planning on meeting with clergy and working with [the Department of Human Service Programs].\u201d\r<br><br>\u201cWe need to help people get out of the cold. We also have workforce programs that provide a stipend for people as they receive job training,\u201d Simmons added.\r<br><br>Despite government promises, Murray said he remains unconvinced. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to change over night.\u201d\r<br><br></span></p>"}

He said that the Lieberman-Warner bill, which would have implemented a carbon cap and trade emissions scheme much in the same vein as that of the EU but was voted down in the Senate this summer, would have been a \u201cvery important effort.\u201d \r<br><br>Dimas also discussed a self-imposed target for the EU to reduce emissions by 20 percent and produce 20 percent of energy from renewable sources by 2020.\r<br><br>Dimas said he viewed this ambitious legislation as a stepping stone rather than as a final solution, and if other countries follow suit, the EU will up its goal.\r<br><br>\u201cThat is what science is telling us is necessary in order to avoid the irreversible and catastrophic impacts of global warming,\u201d he said.\r<br><br>In a question-and-answer session following the talk, John P. Holdren, a professor of environmental policy at the Kennedy School, asked Dimas how the EU can lead on the issue of climate change when so many other countries, including the United States, are \u201cdragging their feet.\u201d\r<br><br>Dimas said one major factor was the goal he adopted when he took office to increase public commitment to the issue. \r<br><br>\u201cThere is a big gap between what [people] say regarding the environment and how they respect the environment regarding individual actions,\u201d Dimas said. \u201cAs consumers they can affect the economy. As voters they can affect politicians.\u201d \r<br><br>Dimas also credited the media\u2019s commitment to covering and prioritizing environmental stories as \u201cvery important in changing public opinion.\u201d\r<br><br>Regardless of the lack of current environmental policy in the United States, Dimas said he has high hopes for the upcoming years. He has spoken with Barack Obama\u2019s advisers and directly with John McCain, and both camps promised to work with Europe in the future to focus on the environment. \r<br><br>His Boston visit also cemented his belief that environmental issues are rapidly gaining ground in the United States.\r<br><br>\u201cToday I have heard views expressed from senators, professors, students and NGOs,\u201d Dimas said at a reception at the Greek Consulate following the talk. \u201cI found that we should be optimistic about the future.

{"title": "From the Street to the Web | Arts | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Late last month, the New York Times ran an obituary for reclusive Hungarian artist Simon Hanta\u00ef. A relative unknown in America, Hanta\u00ef was one of the more innovative figures in 20th-century Continental art, producing works ranging from the \u201c\u00c9criture Rose\u201d\u2014a 14-by-11-foot canvas covered in hand-reproduced texts of various origins\u2014to the \u201cMariales\u201d series\u2014comprised of intricately-folded canvases treated with bright colors, forming beautiful and disorienting aperiodic patterns. For a long period, however, he sealed himself off from the public, becoming virtually invisible. Near the end of his career in public, the Times reports, Hanta\u00ef presented his work at \u201ca noncommercial exhibition space in Paris.\u201d The artist cited an irreconcilable vision of his work with the public as responsible for his isolation: \u201cI felt that the art world was going wrong\u2026 I was starting to receive commissions. I was being asked to paint the ceiling of the Paris Opera House. Society seemed to be preparing to paint my work for me. I could have obeyed; many, perhaps most, painters do. The prospect did not coincide with my desire.\u201d<br><br>Hanta\u00ef\u2019s thought process, that of the artist\u2019s struggle against commercialization, represents a long artistic tradition. The tradition of the street artist stems from a philosophy fundamentally at odds with American property theory. <br><br>The illegal appropriation of surfaces for the work, first and foremost, alienates street art from the rest of the contemporary art world\u2014it flouts the very foundation of the society in which it exists (the law) and necessarily exists outside of it. Contemporary art galleries display their installations behind velvet ropes, where the works can be protected by motion sensors, attentive docents, and security guards. The same is not true of street art. To ensure the survival of their work, street artists count on the durability of their materials rather than the charity of their environment. The very idea that these works could be irrevocably altered\u2014that they are impermanent, evanescent, that their fate is inextricable from the places and people that will suffer them\u2014is another pillar of the craft.<br><br>A more malleable tenet underpinning these principles is the anonymity of the artist. At its outset, street art was a component of the primarily signatory graffiti culture\u2014an artist reflected his or her originality in the textures and contours of their own signature. As the movement has grown in numbers and sophistication, these personae have become less textual and more enigmatic. One of the most well known street art blogs, Streetsy.com, uploads daily photos of street art\u2014postering, stensils, street sculpture, murals, decals, and other work whose merit transcends the pejorative \u201cgraffiti\u201d label\u2014in Los Angeles, New Orleans, New York City, Paris, Tokyo and elsewhere. What makes this site more interesting than the ordinary blog is the strange standard for attribution\u2014the artists are anonymous, but even those artists without a consistent alias can be identified by consistent qualities in their work. \u201cGaia,\u201d for instance, can be distinguished by his or her fondness for stencils of wiry, spider-like creatures and natural forms. <br><br>For up-and-comers, it\u2019s not as easy to gain recognition. One of the site\u2019s frequently asked questions is, \u201cHey\u2014you got my name wrong!\u201d Streetsy\u2019s response: \u201cA lot of times, it\u2019s hard to figure out who created a piece, or what to tag it, so I give the picture a descriptive tag, like \u2018bird\u2019 or \u2018machine.\u2019 Just let me know the correct name, and I\u2019ll make the change.\u201d But a few artists seem to be manipulating their own obscurity. A more famous example is the \u201cOBEY\u201d campaign, originated by designer Shepard Fairey, whose posters and stencils spawned an underground cult that gave way to a lucrative market for clothing and apparel bearing the label.<br><br>Today, the most visible statement from the world of street art is political. Updates on Streetsy and elsewhere frequently show new art dealing with the upcoming presidential election. Given the liberal tendencies of the art world in general, it comes as no surprise that much of the political street art of the day is in support of Barack Obama. The most prominent endorsement of Obama has come by way of conceptual artist Ron English. English\u2019s art tends to concern itself with American popular culture\u2014he\u2019s best known for his lampoon of McDonalds and Disney brand imagery\u2014and Obama as a rising cultural icon seems to have caught his attention. English recently released prints of a portrait of Obama\u2019s face over the features of Abraham Lincoln (beard, hair, top hat, etc.) as posters and stickers meant to adorn subway corridors and street posts.<br><br>The political implications are clear, but whether a stunt like this helps or hurts Obama\u2019s image is another issue altogether\u2014one that English doesn\u2019t seem to care much about. He presents his work in a vacuum, for his patrons to contextualize how they will; the image itself is without textual footnote, be it to clarify or confuse its meaning. <br><br>At the height of his fame, Simon Hanta\u00ef retreated from society, afraid that society wanted to wrest his work from him. Today, Ron English and artists like him seem to be using society itself as another instrument in their art. What ensues is nothing short of fascinating.<br><br>\u2014Columnist Ryan J.

{"title": "MURS | Arts | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>This truly is an historic election cycle. For the first time in history, there are not one, but two black presidential candidates, both seemingly running on a platform of hope, reform, and change. <br><br>Well, actually there\u2019s just one, but with his new album \u201cMURS for President,\u201d underground hip-hop icon MURS is trying to shake things up in his own way. <br><br>It\u2019s easy to connect the frustration of \u201cMURS for President\u201d and the artist\u2019s inspi-rap of change with Barack Obama\u2019s message of hope. But as similar as the two campaigns may be, \u201cMURS for President\u201d is fundamentally about the struggle of MURS (Making Underground Raw Shit) to maintain authenticity within the hip-hop discipline. <br><br>Despite all his rhetoric, the artist formerly known as Nick Carter (not to be confused with former Backstreet Boy and brother of Aaron) mostly strives to maintain the credibility accumulated throughout a decade-long career as an independent rapper and filmmaker. As a result, his biggest fear doesn\u2019t seem to be the destruction of the genre, but the destruction of his cred with a major label release. <br><br>For the most part he succeeds in his mission of shaking up the nation. He schools rappers and listeners alike about their heritage in \u201cThe Science,\u201d which serves as a sort of Cliffs Notes take on the origin of hip-hop and ranges from slavery to crack.<br><br>Similarly, \u201cCan It Be (Half a Million Dollars and 18 Months Later),\u201d which borrows the hook from Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cI Wanna Be Where You Are,\u201d begins with MURS\u2019 solution to all of America\u2019s ailments: \u201cLove one another / Realize there\u2019s no difference.\u201d However, MURS\u2019 indignation at being branded a sellout takes over before long. <br><br>He goes on to respond to the haters accusing him of abandoning the underground sensibility by listing his accomplishments in the scene\u2014for starters, he created a music festival and survived a decade outside the mainstream. MURS adds, \u201cI could have done a Nas and screamed hip-hop is dead / I got up off my ass and did something instead.\u201d Burn.<br><br>The problem arrives when MURS breaks from his social commentary.<br><br>None of the tracks qualify as potential club hits, except, perhaps, \u201cLookin\u2019 Fly,\u201d featuring Will.I.Am. If MURS is truly trying to maintain authenticity, using a widely acknowledged sellout on your album is not the best way to go. \u201cLookin\u2019 Fly\u201d has just enough posturing and repetition to make it danceable. Still, nothing on the album holds a candle to his breakout Madden NFL 2008 soundtrack hit, \u201cDreadlocks.\u201d<br><br>Eighth track \u201cSooo Comfortable\u201d attempts to be a laid-back sort of stoner jam, and mostly succeeds. But MURS does not actually use drugs, despite his natty Rasta dreads, and is unconvincing as a guy tooling around with his pot-smoking friend. <br><br>This becomes glaringly obvious with Snoop Dogg\u2019s guest appearance on the subsequent track, \u201cTime Is Now.\u201d No one has the laid-back Cali vibe down quite like Snoop, and he probably would have been better put to use in \u201cSooo Comfortable\u201d without the gospel-inspired piano chords and righteousness of \u201cTime Is Now.\u201d<br><br>MURS also makes the case for love songs and chivalry. At the beginning of \u201cLove and Appreciate II,\u201d he and producer 9th Wonder bemoan rappers stereotyping women as shrews and hos as well as the lack of rap love songs. To keep a lady, MURS advocates, \u201cBuy some flowers, open up some doors / She needs tampons, homie, go to the store.\u201d<br><br>But MURS spends too much time proving his worthiness at the expense of the album\u2019s message. While it\u2019s refreshing to hear a person reject the misogynistic hip-hop image, he sacrifices too much of his \u201ceclectic eccentricity\u201d (touted in \u201cLookin\u2019 Fly\u201d) for conventional tropes. <br><br>In spite of his best efforts, MURS\u2019 shit is not as raw as his moniker promises.<br><br>Of course, in response to these complaints, the no-longer-underground Nick Carter would say with uncharacteristically good humor, \u201cOh you mad cause I\u2019m stylin\u2019 on you / Love songs one minute then I\u2019m wilin\u2019 on you,\u201d but this sort flip-flopping sacrifices both his integrity and message, and could prove to be the downfall of another prominent presidential candidate.  <br><br>\u2014Reviewer Candace I.

Chalfie \u201969 woke up a little after six from uninterrupted slumber, his first conscious thought was to ask who got this year\u2019s Nobel Prize in Chemistry. He shuffled over to his computer and waited in a sleepy stupor as he checked the Internet for news of the announcement. \n<br><br>As he opened his Web browser, he saw a name: Martin Chalfie. \n<br><br>A professor at Columbia, Chalfie and two other scientists took this year\u2019s Nobel for the discovery and development of the green fluorescent protein found in the crystal jelly\u2014a bioluminescent jellyfish found off the west coast of the United States. The protein has since become one of the most important tools of molecular biology for cracking open the secret of cell processes. \n<br><br>The fluorescent proteins are now commonly used to study the growth and development of nerve cells damaged during Alzheimer\u2019s, for example, or cancer cells. \n<br><br>Chalfie will split the $1.4 million prize\u2014awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences\u2014with Roger Y. Tsien \u201972, a professor at the University of California, San Diego, and Osamu Shimomura, an emeritus professor at Boston University Medical School. \n<br><br>\u201cYou have friends who say [they]  think you should get this\u2014and you really hope that they are going to be right,\u201d Chalfie said in a phone interview. \u201cBut you never really assume that this is going to happen.\u201d \n<br><br>The bearer of good news from Sweden did leave a message, but Chalfie said that he did not think to check the machine when he awoke. \n<br><br>\u201cI guess my phone wasn\u2019t working very well,\u201d Chalfie said, chuckling as he quipped, \u201cI guess that\u2019s going to be the news item.\u201d\n<br><br>Biologists have long known that some sea creatures glow in the dark. Shimomura, who now resides in Falmouth, Mass., asked a surprisingly simple question\u2014how do different organisms produce light? \n<br><br>The Japanese scientist joined a researcher from Princeton, Frank Johnson, to successfully isolated a specific glowing protein, now known as the GFP, in the crystal jelly in 1962. \n<br><br>\u201cThis was basic research,\u201d Chalfie said. \u201cTrying to understand fundamental processes that take place as organisms develop and how their various cells interact with one another\u2014one can see what happens with those cells by asking questions about the fundamentals of biology.\u201d  \n<br><br>J. Woodland Hastings, a Harvard professor of molecular and cellular biology affectionately nicknamed \u201cWoody,\u201d who is known for his work in bioluminescence, said that though basic research may seem unimportant, it has led to findings applicable to many important problems in science. \n<br><br>\u201cMany have often failed to appreciate the importance of basic knowledge,\u201d Hastings said, adding that scientists should not follow Republican presidential nominee John McCain in deprecating the study of DNA in bears. (While McCain has mockingly said in recent weeks that he didn\u2019t know if the research were  due to \u201ca paternity issue or a criminal issue,\u201d Hastings applauded the fact that the federal government has been supportive of fundamental science research in  the past.)\n<br><br>Hastings added that he knew Tsien, a \u201cremarkable guy\u201d when the budding scientist was an undergraduate at the College, although he had never taught Tsien. \n<br><br>Tsien, who won first prize in the national Westinghouse talent search at the age of 16, entered the Ivy gates as a freshman set on devoting his studies to the hard sciences. \n<br><br>His freshman roommate, Herman C. Quirmbach \u201972, described Tsien as \u201cincredibly brilliant.\u201d \n<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s probably not an exaggeration to say he\u2019s the smartest person I ever met,\u201d said Quirmbach, now an economics professor at Iowa State University and a Democratic member of the Iowa Senate. \u201cAnd I have met a lot of brilliant people.\u201d \n<br><br>Chalfie, who was just graduating when Tsien matriculated at the College, was not as convinced that science would be the career he would take.\n<br><br>A biochemistry concentrator, Chalfie said that he worked in a laboratory the summer after his junior year at the College. \n<br><br>\u201cIt was a complete and utter failure,\u201d Chalfie said. \u201cIt was so disheartening to completely fail that I decided I shouldn\u2019t be in biology.\u201d \n<br><br>Chalfie then finished up his senior year and taught high school for a couple years before working with a researcher at Yale. The experience was far less miserable, and Chalfie received his PhD in physiology from Harvard in 1977. \n<br><br>\u201cI guess I wasn\u2019t a complete failure,\u201d Chalfie said. \n<br><br>Paul S. Weinberg \u201969, who was Chalfie\u2019s freshman roommate in Wigglesworth Hall, best remembers the Nobel laureate as funny and gregarious. \n<br><br>\u201cOh my god!\u201d Weinberg exclaimed when he heard the news of Chalife\u2019s Nobel prize. Now a trial lawyer at a law firm in Northampton, Mass., Weinberg said after a pensive pause that he did not remember Chalfie as a scientist during their time together at the College. \n<br><br>\u201cHe would always identify himself as a swimmer\u2014Marty was on the Harvard swim team,\u201d Weinberg said.\n<br><br>Weinberg recalled that he once walked in on Chalfie shaving his legs in preparation for a swim meet. \n<br><br>\u201cIt was about the weirdest thing you could ever imagine,\u201d Weinberg said. He then excused himself from the interview to give his former roommate a call. \n<br><br>\u2014Staff writer June Q. Wu can be reached at junewu@fas.harvard.edu.</span></p>"}
{"title": "CAPS Panel Profs Analyse Elections | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Weiqi Zhang", "body": "<p><span>Four political experts gathered on Friday at the Center for American Political Studies to probe the dynamics of the imminent presidential election.\r<br><br>The panel discussion, moderated by government professor Stephen D. Ansolabehere, featured D. Sunshine Hillygus, also a government professor and the director of the Program on Survey Research; Columbia Graduate School of Journalism professor Thomas B. Edsall; and Morris P. Fiorina, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and political science professor at Stanford.\r<br><br>Ansolabehere began with a discussion on campaign finance and the parallel contests of the presidential and congressional elections, stressing the tough decision facing the Republican Party.\r<br><br>\u201cAre they going to put the money in races to keep the McCain campaign going, or are they going to put their money in a set of embattled Senate seats?\u201d Ansolabehere said. \u201cThe Republican National Committee has a very difficult choice.\u201d\r<br><br>The panel then explored opinions on polling models used for the elections. \r<br><br>Edsall, who is also the political editor of the liberal-leaning Huffington Post, said that he believes in the accuracy of models that are predicting Obama\u2019s victory, even though their performance \u201chas been a little spotty over the years.\u201d\r<br><br>\u201cThe models are all based on fundamentals,\u201d Edsall said. \u201cThose include the performance of the current administration, the condition of the economy, whether there is a war going on.\u201d\r<br><br>Hillygus focused on the common misconceptions of swing voters.\r<br><br>\u201cIndependents are actually not the appropriate measure of whether somebody is going to be influenced by the campaign.\u201d she said. \u201cMore than a third of the independents have been consistent Obama or McCain supporters.\u201d\r<br><br>Demographic groups, such as \u201chockey moms\u201d or \u201cworking class wives,\u201d are not the best measure of persuadable voters either, said Hillygus. \u201cIf you look at working class wives, and we broke by income you get wildly different predictions of how someone is going to pay.\u201d\r<br><br>\u201cThe thing we know as political scientists is that demography is not destiny,\u201d she added.\r<br><br>Fiorina, the author of \u201cDivided Government,\u201d discussed split-ticket voters that intentionally choose one party for president and another for Congress, taking this path because of its perceived benefits.\r<br><br>More than 80 faculty members, graduate and undergraduate students, and residents of the community packed the conference room at CGIS for the panel.\r<br><br>\u201cAmerican politics looks very obscure to me. This is why I want to come here,\u201d said Stefano Versace, an MIT graduate student from Italy. \u201cI\u2019m very interested in it, especially at such a crucial point when there is also the economic crisis.\u201d</span></p>"}
{"title": "Net Addiction | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Hi, my name is Alexandra, and I\u2019m a netaholic.  \n<br><br>In the course of writing this column, I have checked my email 19 times, watched four youtube videos, read 26 past issues of xkcd, attempted to watch Pirates 2, and read an entire Wikipedia article about the history of conjugal visits. The only way I was able to finish at all was to go somewhere where there wasn\u2019t any internet, but given the expansion of wireless technology, this was harder than it seemed. One of the best reasons to oppose the Obama campaign right now is its promise of expanding wireless coverage to include the whole nation. If it weren\u2019t for dead spots, I\u2019d never accomplish anything.\n<br><br>And maybe I\u2019m not alone. If you \u201cspend more time than you think you should surfing the Net,\u201d \u201cfeel you have a problem limiting the time you spend on the Net,\u201d \u201cfind it hard to stay away from the Net for several days at a time,\u201d \u201cfind particular areas of the Net, or types of files, hard to resist,\u201d \u201chave trouble controlling your impulses to purchase items, products, or services on the Net,\u201d \u201chave tried, unsuccessfully, to curtail your use of the \u2018Net,\u201d or have had \u201ceither your work output or your personal relationships [suffer] as a result of spending too much time on the Net,\u201d you too may be at risk of \u201cNet\u201d addiction, according to an online survey  linked by the Bureau of Study Counsel Web site. \n<br><br>The obvious question aside\u2014isn\u2019t listing the signs of internet addiction online like inscribing the symptoms of alcohol addiction at the bottom of a vodka bottle?\u2014it was disturbing to find that what I had chalked up to simple procrastination could, in the right hands, be transformed into a terrifying condition. Ours is a culture that throws serious terms like \u201crape\u201d and \u201caddiction\u201d around unthinkingly, e.g. \u201cI was raped by that ec test\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m addicted to internet porn.\u201d But at what point do you stop being \u201caddicted\u201d to something and become actually addicted to it? And what if I had reached that point? I needed to take action, and soon! \n<br><br>I called the Bureau of Study Counsel and asked if I could \u201cturn myself in\u201d as a Net addict. But some helpful pamphlets on time management aside, they didn\u2019t have anything to tell me about my condition. My counselor apologetically suggested, \u201cYou could google it.\u201d  University Mental Health Services proved similarly forthcoming. I gave my number to someone rumored to be an expert on the subject, but he has yet to call me.  \n<br><br>I was puzzled. Based on the descriptions, internet addiction seemed utterly dire. I expected to be whisked away to a clinic with an optimistic name like \u201cWireless Promises\u201d and slowly nursed back to health by a team of experts. Instead, no one seemed to think I had a problem. And perhaps there was good reason for this. Perhaps \u201cNet Addiction\u201d is not so much a constant danger that looms over people who know and use the internet as it is a fear of people who don\u2019t.\n<br><br>Indeed, many of the case samples cited on the website ComputerAddiction.com, the online face of Harvard Medical School\u2019s Computer Addiction Study Center in Belmont, Mass., sound more like jokes from \u201cThe Office\u201d than indicators of anything dire:  \u201cA corporate department head stays late each night to meet deadlines.  In-house monitoring of computer use reveals he frequently accesses inappropriate sites, including gambling and pornography.\u201d  \n<br><br>According to Harvard Medical School Assistant Professor Maressa Hecht Orzack, the problem is that \u201cour society is becoming more and more computer dependent not only for information, but for fun and entertainment.  This trend is a potential problem affecting all ages, starting with computer games for kids to chats for the unwary or vulnerable adult.\u201d  \n<br><br>Yet this doesn\u2019t sound like a problem. Our generation has grown up on the internet, and most of us still manage to lead normal lives.  Indeed, the very term \u201cNet Addiction\u201d belies the fact that those coming up with these horrifying categories do not belong to the internet generation. No one who has been near a computer since 1997 still uses the term \u201cNet.\u201d These are people who still say things like \u201cWhat\u2019s the URL?\u201d or \u201csurf the World Wide Web,\u201d or have AOL. Add to this the fact that ComputerAddiction.com hasn\u2019t been updated since 2003\u2014it doesn\u2018t even use frames\u2014and it begins to look increasingly as though internet addiction is, for the most part, not a mental disorder but a generational issue. Professor Orzack herself was born in 1924.  As experts tend to agree, the internet is not a substance so much as it is a medium\u2014although it offers access to a world of harmful behaviors, the same could be said of the state of New Jersey.  The internet is not the culprit\u2014it\u2019s simply the conduit. And those terrified by visions of an entire generation hunched over glowing screens into the wee hours of the night are the people who still think jokes about confusing computer mice with live animals are funny.\n<br><br>So the fact that you probably found yourself meeting the criteria for internet addiction shouldn\u2019t send you running towards treatment.  It should suggest that the very terms of internet addiction could stand to be redefined.  Which is good news for all of us, because I have a fun Youtube link.  \n<br><br>\n<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Alexandra A.

This financial crisis has changed the view of the United States and of our own sense of economic strength.\u201d<br><br>Summers, who is an adviser to Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama, also took a shot at the Bush administration. He said that while the United States still attracts \u201cmany of the world\u2019s most talented people,\u201d misfires like the government\u2019s handling of Guantanamo Bay, Abu Ghraib, and Hurricane Katrina have hurt the country\u2019s reputation.<br><br>On the topic of economic inequality, the former Treasury Secretary cited the importance of both creating prosperity and spreading its benefits.<br><br>\u201cPeople who once felt security in heir communities, their livelihoods, their nation, and the world no longer feel secure,\u201d Summers said. \u201cThey think that their economic security is hanging by a thread, and they\u2019re not sure what the new global system is going to be like for them. Our challenge is to make the system work for all these people.\u201d <br><br>Summers closed his speech noting that capitalism had successfully faced down similar challenges in the past. <br><br>\u201cIn the 20th century, we saw a Republican Roosevelt and a Democratic Roosevelt preside over periods when capitalism was saved from itself,\u201d Summers said. \u201cThis is our challenge today.\u201d <br><br>CAPITALISM IN DANGER?<br><br>A panel moderated by Business School professor Michael E.

{"title": "Jesus is My Running Mate | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>In his book The Audacity of Hope, Senator Barack Obama advances a thesis that can seem, perhaps true to form, rather utopian. He holds that\u2014in spite of the cultural schism of the 1960s and the end of bipartisan pragmatism\u2014Americans are not so different, and that a combination of their shared values might be enough to unite a sweeping new majority. In so doing, he engages in a little willful bifurcation, implying that \u2018ordinary Americans\u2019 are the victims, not the agents, of a climate of red-vs.-blue rancor, taking Michaels Moore and Savage to task without conceding that each man has an audience of eager millions.\n<br><br>That said, the almost messianic, unitive ambitions that may hang around Sen. Obama like a halo seem to pale in comparison to those expressed by his opponent\u2019s running mate, who hopes to shift the collective consciousness altogether and to extremes. The most worrying aspect of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is not her vacillation on earmarks, and certainly not her 17-year-old daughter\u2019s pregnancy. Rather, it\u2019s the totalizing philosophy the governor seems to have picked up in the pew.\n<br><br>The many attitudes that form up Palin\u2019s religious perspective have been quick to come to light: the governor supports an outright ban on abortions, challenges the view that man is not responsible for climate change, and believes that her plan to put a natural-gas pipeline in Alaska has the support of the big public-works director in the sky. \n<br><br>But more unnerving than any one of the governor\u2019s Christian-fundamentalist policy goals is the operating mechanism she sees compelling their implementation. Rather than resign herself\u2014as Obama has\u2014to seeking a functional agreement in a complex world, Palin would prefer to achieve cohesion and progress through simple homogeneity. \n<br><br>In the past week we\u2019ve learned that despite officially renouncing her status as a Pentecostal Christian, Palin retains that tradition\u2019s fervor for proselytizing. In the Chicago Tribune, Palin\u2019s own pastor envisaged the political bearing her faith might have on the United States, saying, \u201cI believe Sarah would not live in a fragmented world,\u201d and adding that her worldview, \u201cthat really only the Bible and the relationship with Jesus opens up,\u201d could not simply be \u2018marginalized\u2019 in the interest of secular leadership.\n<br><br>Moments after encouraging the faithful at her old Pentecostal church to pray for pipeline revenue, she proved her pastor right: \u201cI can do my job [in Anchorage] in developing our natural resources, doing things like getting the roads paved\u2026but really all of that stuff doesn\u2019t do any good if the people of Alaska\u2019s heart isn\u2019t right with God. And that\u2019s gonna be your job\u2026to be out there reaching the people and converting the people of Alaska.\u201d This was last year.\n<br><br>Palin\u2019s active brand of Christian faith displays internal contradictions as well, the hypocrisies that always dwell with zeal. Asked whether she thinks evolution or creationism should be taught to Alaskan schoolchildren, Palin fell back upon the language of free speech: \u201cTeach both. You know, don\u2019t be afraid of information\u2026Healthy debate is so important, and it\u2019s so valuable in our schools.\u201d Yet, as mayor of Wasilla, Palin hoped to ban certain books from the town library. For Palin, the belief that the Judeo-Christian God created the universe is one worth exposing to young people in science class, all while those same tender minds are protected from the notion that there exists a magical kingdom called Terabithia.\n<br><br>Both tickets made much ado at their respective conventions about how America can be better, how we might change our nature and our image on the global stage. In Sen. Obama\u2019s mind, the hope would seem to be that America might transcend its petty divisions and again become the exemplar of liberal government. \n<br><br>Meanwhile, not unlike the so-called Islamofascists, Sarah Palin has a different vision for the future, for a world in which, as Juan Cole observed yesterday in Salon, \u201cfaith is not a private affair of individuals but rather a moral imperative that believers should import into statecraft wherever they have the opportunity to do so.\u201d \n<br><br>So while Obama keeps failing to wholly escape the allegation that he\u2019s a crypto-Muslim, the hockey mom so beloved by his attackers has publicly embraced the most conservative tenets of Sharia.

{"title": "A True Reformer | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Democrats claim John McCain\u2019s pick of Sarah Palin as his running mate is cynical. Palin has sparked a culture war, they say, which will trick people into voting for the candidate they like over the one whose policies will benefit them.\r\n<br><br>But these critics are waging a phony war: Palin\u2019s record of reform underlines McCain\u2019s message, and the Republican ticket is appealing to voters on more than just \u201cGod, guns, \u2019n\u2019 babies.\u201d\r\n<br><br>Like McCain, Palin is running on her history of combating special interests, even within her own party. In fact, Wall Street Journal reporter Laura Meckler notes that while Palin is socially conservative, she does not mention abortion or gay marriage in her speeches. \r\n<br><br>She\u2019s taken down a few head honchos, too. As a member of Alaska\u2019s oil and gas commission, she investigated the state Republican Party chairman for doing party work on government time , and launched an ethics probe against the Republican state attorney general . Both men resigned. After defeating incumbent Gov. Frank Murkowski for the GOP nomination and winning the general election, Palin sold the gubernatorial jet  and ditched the complimentary chef , boosting her approval rating to a high of 93 percent. \r\n<br><br>Palin\u2019s career in Juneau mirrors McCain\u2019s tenure in Washington. McCain pilloried former Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld\u2019s military strategy in Iraq , scrutinized lobbyist Jack Abramoff\u2019s dealings with Indian tribes , and railed against the pork barrel projects approved by a Republican Congress . While Palin scraped the pork barrel for federal dollars herself, she also line-item-vetoed $268 million worth of hometown projects from the state budget, or about 10 percent of state spending.  These political victories have enabled the McCain campaign to sell her as a bull moose, not as a culture warrior. \r\n<br><br>Most importantly, Palin can speak with credibility on energy, a top concern among voters . Last month, she signed plans to build a $26 billion natural gas pipeline, which she spent months negotiating.  On the stump, she advocates drilling for oil in the Alaska Northern Wildlife Refuge, which most Americans favor. The McCain-Palin platform is calling for lower energy prices, and talking about people\u2019s pocketbooks, not their Bibles.\r\n<br><br>The proof is in the polling. According to a recent CBS News poll, 46 percent of independents view Palin favorably, while Joe Biden musters only 31 percent. What\u2019s more, 53 percent of registered voters approve of McCain\u2019s choice for VP, while 48 percent are happy with Barack Obama\u2019s. Who\u2019s polarizing whom?\r\n<br><br>More likely, Democrats are upset that McCain has picked a smart, energetic running mate, who gives him a fighting chance to win in November. And Republicans can\u2019t help but relish in asking them: \u201cWhat? Can\u2019t handle a strong woman?\u201d\r\n<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Brian J.

Focus on the Family leader James C. Dobson applauded the choice as \u201coutstanding,\u201d while Palin\u2019s fiery speech at the convention prompted a rash of donations to the Obama campaign that totaled close to $10 million in the 24 hours that followed.  <br><br>The political advisability of McCain\u2019s controversial choice will be revealed in the months to come.We have some concerns about what the selection of Palin means for the character of this election.<br><br>For close to a decade, the Republican Party has gotten considerable mileage out of a narrative of cultural conflict that pits a snobbish, educated, costal elite against the hard-working, god-fearing denizens of the country\u2019s heartland. As Thomas Frank describes in his book, \u201cWhat\u2019s the Matter with Kansas?\u201d, this narrative has become so powerful that it has come to trump nearly all policy considerations: Voters who might be expected to support the policies of the Democratic Party are driven into the Republican camp in a bizarre attempt to stick it to the \u201celite.\u201d  This is the brand of politics that seemed to convince so many that John Kerry\u2019s policy proposals were far less important than the fact that he spoke French, preferred Swiss to Cheez Whiz on his sandwiches, and liked to windsurf. <br><br>And this is the brand of politics to which Sarah Palin adheres. She is a cultural warrior of the first rank. In her convention speech, Palin pulled no punches in her offensive, painting an almost mythical portrait of small-town America where the people \u201clove their country, in good times and bad, and they\u2019re always proud of America,\u201d which she contrasted with the \u201cWashington elite\u201d that had disapproved of her selection. The speech made it very clear which cultural category contained Barack Obama, who Palin described as a condescending elitist who \u201clavishes praise on working people when they are listening, and then talks about how bitterly they cling to their religion and guns when those people aren\u2019t listening.\u201d  These sentiments were the theme of the evening at the Republican Convention, as Palin\u2019s predecessor on the lectern, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, claimed that Obama didn\u2019t consider Sarah Palin\u2019s experience as mayor of Wasilla, Alaska (population less than 6,000 during Palin\u2019s tenure) \u201cflashy\u201d or \u201ccosmopolitan\u201d enough.  <br><br>There is no doubt that there are significant cultural differences among Americans today. Whether one grows up in Wasilla or New York certainly influences one\u2019s worldview in meaningful ways. But when such concerns come to supercede all others\u2014when a culture war trumps the Iraq war and Barack Obama\u2019s preference for arugula becomes more important than his tax policy\u2014then American politics sink to a level that makes waging real debates over the direction of this country impossible. As a case in point, witness the transformation of the Republican Party, which, after spending months characterizing Barack Obama as \u201cnot ready to lead,\u201d quickly embraced the even more inexperienced Sarah Palin as a result of cultural affinity. The merits of experience, like the merits of policy proposals, have taken a back seat to things far less consequential.<br><br>John McCain\u2019s campaign manager Rick Davis recently said that, \u201cThis election is not about issues. This election is about a composite view of what people take away from these candidates.\u201d  This cynical approach, which has dominated American politics for too long, only confirms that John McCain is no maverick, but instead is willing to embrace the same false narrative that has distracted our country for years from the real and pressing challenges that face it.<br><br></span></p>"}
{"title": "Faces of the Party | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>McCain\u2019s a portrait\u2026Obama\u2019s a mural.\u201d\n<br><br>So rapped will.i.am, leader of the Black Eyed Peas, as he bounced across the stage in a tent outside of the Colorado Convention Center early Friday morning, hours after Barack Obama delivered his keynote speech to a crowd of over 80,000\u2014including me\u2014at Denver\u2019s Invesco Field. \n<br><br>That sentiment, seemingly an allusion to the breadth and complexity of the Democratic candidate and the party he represents, cut to the heart of the 2008 Democratic National Convention.\n<br><br>As many have noted, the convention was incredibly diverse. In fact, more African Americans, Asians, Pacific Islanders, Hispanics, Native Americans, persons with disabilities, gays and lesbians participated in the historic events in Denver than have ever attended a Democratic convention before.  \n<br><br>Some people call conventions mere pomp and pageantry, a time for the good old boys to wring hands, pat each other\u2019s backs, and schmooze with each other before attending a superficial exercise to nominate a candidate who has already won the primaries. But that\u2019s not what I saw. What I saw\u2014all the way from an incredible portrait exhibit in the daytime convention center, where every issue group imaginable caucused each day, to my seat in a club space at Invesco Field\u2014was a party comprised of incredibly varied and complex individuals. \n<br><br>At the convention I participated in a project that captured photographic portraits of convention attendees, from average delegates to major politicians and celebrities. Called \u201cFaces of 2008: art(IM)possible,\u201d the project  aimed to display the reality that none of us is defined by a single characteristic. With over one hundred images, this project reinforced the usefulness of the convention as a place to see and understand the incredible variety of people who compose the Democratic Party today. This tangible evidence ranged from portraits of John Lewis, a congressman and leader of the Civil Rights Movement; to delegate Bill Walsh, a former casino owner, cowboy, and catholic priest from South Dakota; to a Laotian couple who married in the United States but grew up hiding in the jungle and living in refugee camps before emigrating to America. Portraits also included a famous musician, several Hollywood actors, a Puerto Rican delegate, a farmer from Nebraska with a PhD from Yale, and a gay former Republican operative ousted from his party and now working for Obama. Never before has the Democratic Party stood for so many\u2014and so many at once. \n<br><br>The diverse reality that \u201cFaces of 2008\u201d captured is a new reality for the United States, and the Democratic Party is changing in lockstep. The year 2000 marked the first time that US census respondents could identify themselves as being multiple races. The changing nature of identity in America is manifested in both the Democratic frontrunner and, more importantly, by the party supporting him. True, Obama is the hardest Democratic candidate to define in history. By some measures, Obama is white and black, rich and poor, at home in elite institutions and on the streets of the South Side of Chicago. But the real importance of Obama\u2019s candidacy is the incredible base of support that gave it rise. At the Democratic Convention, that base was on show, and its diversity and uniqueness proved that the Democratic Party, from the top of the ticket on down, represents real American people.\n<br><br>The evening of August 28th, 2008, is already being called one of the largest political rallies in American history, not to mention the reach of its broadcast. On television, more Americans tuned in for Obama\u2019s speech than did for the opening ceremonies of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, aired just a few weeks earlier.  Obama and the Democratic Party represent, both literally and figuratively, a party that looks like, acts like, and identifies with the true complexity of Americans today. \n<br><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Robert G.

{"title": "Trading Spaces: Palin and Obama | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>From the taxi drivers mourning slow business from a low turnout to the confused delegates figuring out the uncertain schedule, the Republican National Convention  was disappointing. My recent trip there was tainted by lackluster speeches, and a hasty vice presidential decision.\n<br><br>Spotlighting Governor Sarah Palin as the convention\u2019s focus was a directional error. Naturally, one would expect that the convention\u2014or much of the Republican campaign for that matter\u2014would emphasize McCain\u2019s comparative advantage over Obama. Indeed, this comparison has many valid discussion points; differences in tax and foreign policy, for example, continue to define the political debate. Ironically, though, Republicans used the convention mainly to introduce and display their vice presidential candidate, Governor Palin, thus comparing her against the focus of the Democratic National Convention, Senator Barack Obama.\n<br><br>Aligning the Republican vice presidential candidate against the Democratic presidential candidate is an illogical strategy in more ways than one. Placing Governor Palin on this pedestal pushes Senator McCain out of the picture. Republicans would have benefited to focus less on the inexperienced Palin and more on the experienced McCain. Palin\u2019s vice presidential resume consists of a brief tenure in the city council and then as mayor of Wasilla, a small Alaskan city, after which she was governor of Alaska for only two years.   She has no significant national experience, unlike the other candidates on the Democratic and Republican tickets. Instead of reminding the public of his own achievements, McCain squandered a valuable media opportunity on an invaluable running mate.\n<br><br>Comparing Palin\u2019s relatively paltry service in the small Wasilla and 20 months as Alaska\u2019s governor  to Obama\u2019s tenure as state senator and then U.S. senator for Illinois can only hurt the Republican Party. Her speech weakly hid this fact, instead comparing her tenure as mayor to his pre-Harvard Law School service as community organizer. \u201cI guess a small-town mayor is sort of like a \u2018community organizer,\u2019 except that you have actual responsibilities,\u201d she quipped.  \n<br><br>This issue of experience played a large role in the Democratic primaries, when Senator Hillary Clinton flaunted her experience over Obama\u2019s. McCain had similarly highlighted his experience to Obama\u2019s detriment. Obama\u2019s campaign responded with the message that Obama is experienced enough to think critically about the issues, but inexperienced enough to be untouched by the corruption in Washington, a careful balancing act. Now it seems that Palin is trying to do the same. While this parallel may draw some voters, it seems to provide more evidence instead for McCain\u2019s hasty vice presidential decision on an inexperienced leader.\n<br><br>Perhaps Palin\u2019s inexperience, among other reasons, is why some advisors close to John McCain have criticized this choice, calling it \u201ccynical,\u201d according to Mike Murphy, a senior advisor in the 2000 McCain campaign.  \n<br><br>Pitting Obama against Palin instead of McCain also places one minority against another, with possibly disastrous consequences. Comparing a woman and a half-black man feeds off ignorant minority groupings that might isolate some voters. Minority status is not merely a requisite characteristic needed for a strong ticket for each party; presidential campaigns are about leadership, not demographic groups, after all. \n<br><br>Although conventions only confirm, and no longer decide the party ticket, they now serve a great role in publicizing the party platform. The DNC was fairly successful in this way; after it was over and McCain announced his running-mate, Obama led McCain by about seven percentage points in an average of five national polls.  The RNC\u2019s repercussions may be different. The convention\u2019s focus on Palin left a lasting impression on Americans. After Palin\u2019s speech Wednesday night at the convention, Obama\u2019s campaign made $10 million\u2014a one-day fundraising record.  Coincidence or not? I leave the comparison up to you. \n<br><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Nafees A.

{"title": "A Real Debate | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>As the presidential and vice-presidential debates approach, one of the more peculiar rituals of American politics has resurfaced: In a cynical attempt to lower public expectations for their candidates performance, the Republican and Democratic campaigns have begun to talk about what bad debaters their own candidates are. This stale tactic, which assumes that the American public is naively unaware of the oft-played expectation game, has been evident in both the McCain and Obama camps. But while these silly attempts to lower expectations may be meaningless, the debates themselves are not.\r<br><br>In a political culture dominated by sound bytes and rhetoric, where the campaign season primarily consists of pre-screened questions and carefully rehearsed speeches in front of staunchly partisan crowds, it\u2019s nice that for a few short moments every election, the Republican and Democratic candidates for president are forced to actually engage with one another in formal debates. These events offer valuable and potent opportunities for Americans to see the presidential hopefuls directly challenge each other\u2019s policy proposals and present their cases to become the next commander-in-chief.\r<br><br>Consequently, we are pleased to see that the schedule of three debates recently agreed upon by the campaigns of Barack Obama and John McCain includes considerable opportunities for questioning and free-form discussion. In the newly agreed upon formats, each topical segment will contain a few minutes for an opening overview, followed by several minutes of open-ended debate in which the candidates will be able to directly engage with one other. \r<br><br>This is a clear improvement over a more rigid structure, as it helps emphasize what makes the debates such unique events on the campaign calendar: their ability to force candidates to respond directly to an adversary\u2019s challenge. Too often, overly structured debate too closely resembles two simultaneous interviews, with each candidate spouting carefully memorized talking points, rather than a substantive debate in which the merits of ideas can truly be tested.\r<br><br>It seems a shame, therefore, that this same flexibility will not characterize the vice-presidential debate, in which Senator Joe Biden will face off against Governor Sarah Palin. Unlike its presidential counterpart, the much-anticipated Biden-Palin showdown will be constrained by a more restrictive format that leaves little time for questions or interactions between debaters. \r<br><br>Even more troubling than the curtailed structure is that the McCain campaign has publicly admitted to insisting upon such a format in an attempt to hide the inexperience of its vice-presidential nominee. The campaign even tried to eliminate question-and-answer segments from the debate entirely, as aides openly expressed concern that Palin would be at a disadvantage against the savvy and experienced Biden.\r<br><br>Debates exist to unmask weaknesses, not to hide them. In this election cycle, the vice-presidential debate ought to be an opportunity for the citizenry to discover the largely unknown Palin\u2014even if that includes her potential unfamiliarity with relevant political topics\u2014not for the McCain campaign to doctor the debate format to hide her weaknesses. Informing the electorate about candidates\u2019 qualifications (or lack thereof) is precisely the reason for such exchanges. Without free-flowing argumentation, debates become little more than 90-minute spectacles of empty rhetoric. Public interest, not the political needs of a given candidate, should determine a debate\u2019s structure.\r<br><br>As John McCain would surely argue, in these precious few times of year when policy positions can actually be examined, politics should come second, and country first.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Kerry Wins Mass Primary | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Senator John F. Kerry, the veteran senator who was the Democratic presidential nominee in 2004, easily won the Massachusetts Democratic primary on Tuesday, though a strong showing by a virtually unknown challenger evidenced the voter frustration that many political analysts have said is a potent political force this election cycle.\r<br><br>With half of the precincts reporting, Kerry was leading Edward O\u2019Reilly, a lawyer and former firefighter, by a two-to-one margin. While Kerry carried virtually every city and town in the Commonwealth, O\u2019Reilly ran strong in places such as his hometown of Gloucester, where Kerry won by only a few points.\r<br><br>\u201cThere are unfinished fights that we must win, and I want to return to Washington to make sure every American has the same great health care that I receive as a senator,\u201d Kerry said in a statement, according to the Associated Press. \u201cI have always been honored to be the Junior Senator from Massachusetts.\u201d\r<br><br>Kerry is heavily favored to win a fifth term over Republican Jeff Beatty in November. \r<br><br>During the campaign, O\u2019Reilly styled himself as a more principled and liberal alternative to Kerry, lambasting the senator for his 2002 vote in favor of military action in Iraq. He also argued that Kerry\u2014who is well-known nationally while never having the local following of Massachusetts\u2019 senior senator, Edward M. Kennedy \u201954-\u201956\u2014should devote more time to representing the interests of his constituents.\r<br><br>The race represented Kerry\u2019s first contested Democratic primary since he first won a three-way primary in 1984, a race that pitted Kerry, the lieutenant governor, against two congressmen, James M. Shannon and Edward J. Markey. \r<br><br>Kerry\u2019s recent victory by more than thirty points is likely to be one of the closer races in the Commonwealth this election cycle. \r<br><br>Republican John McCain has already conceded liberal Massachusetts to the Democratic nominee, Barack Obama, and the state\u2019s politicians\u2014notably Kerry, Kennedy, and Governor Deval L.

{"title": "Servitude Nation | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Over 60 million people volunteered in the United States last year, or over a quarter of the American populace. The US is also home to 7,500 hospitals, 18,000 nursing homes, a school system that is heavily understaffed, and a military that is dangerously undermanned. But last Thursday, Senators Barack Obama and John McCain said that not enough Americans volunteer, and, they claim, this is due to a lack of opportunities.\n<br><br>The candidates were speaking at a conference organized by ServiceNation, an organization that seeks to expand the role of national service in people\u2019s lives. The timing of the event\u2014exactly seven years after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001\u2014was strategic as well as symbolic. Those events inspired many Americans to volunteer, whether as members of the armed services, the search and rescue teams at the disaster sites, or just in their own communities. The overwhelming surge of solidarity and self-sacrifice that followed the tragedy was channeled into an outpouring of service.\n<br><br>These are noble impulses, and those who devote part or all of their lives to helping others are to be commended. But in their speeches, the presidential candidates encouraged an ideal of service that is centered not on individuals giving back to their community, but on citizens serving their country. Obama and McCain both thought that it was the job of the federal government to provide opportunities for Americans to serve. In fact, the presumption of the entire event was that the federal government does not do enough to help Americans volunteer.\n<br><br>There are several problems with the way Obama and McCain conceive of service. One is that having the government decide whether a certain job constitutes service, and potentially helping to encourage it, raises legal and constitutional issues. If someone serves through political activism, having the government support him or her could violate campaign finance law. If someone serves through religious work, it could raise issues of separation of church and state. If the government provides the same kind of support for these kinds of activities, it is discriminating against some of the most meaningful and valuable ways in which people serve their country.\n<br><br>Furthermore, if we have the government pay people to \u201cvolunteer\u201d\u2014perhaps by making college more affordable for those who do, as Obama suggests\u2014then what they do is not service as such, but a job, paid for with taxpayer dollars. This also raises an important vagueness in the concept of service. What is the sharp distinction between jobs that are traditionally considered service, such as being a soldier, and jobs that are not, such as being a shop clerk? If that seems too clear, what about being a firefighter, police officer, doctor, sanitary worker, or bureaucrat? Without an understanding of which jobs, when paid for, still constitute service, a vision of universal service is equivalent to a new federal work program. \n<br><br>Perhaps the most important issue is that this idea of service is inherently nationalistic. What its advocates desire is not service for its own sake, but service as a way to strengthen people\u2019s ties to their government. Rick Stengel, the managing editor of Time magazine, lamented in an article last year in Time that volunteer rates are higher than they have ever been.  Why is this a problem? Because it accompanies record low confidence in democracy and the American government. His concern is that \u201c[p]eople see volunteering not as a form of public service but as an antidote to it.\u201d Stengel wants truly national service, run by a bureaucracy within the federal government. The desire for this sort of program, rather than selfless individual service, is a solely nationalistic aim, and has nothing to do with a healthy service sector. \n<br><br>While McCain and Obama mentioned the importance of other kinds of service during their speeches, they should realize that the more national and centralized service becomes, the less diversity there will be within it. Local and state governments, as well as religious groups and volunteer organizations, understand the specific needs and capabilities of their communities far better than Washington. If the next president succeeds in focusing the volunteer efforts of the nation in the federal government, then that service will become far less effective.\n<br><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Daniel P.

And to be perfectly honest, at the time, I wasn\u2019t really interested. I was playing in the band, we were on the verge of getting a record deal, and I was working for a record label. I was really kind of immersed in the world that I wanted to be immersed in, and school was something I was doing to appease my parents, to be perfectly honest.

I hate to say blanket statements about liberals or conservatives, but I wish that people who were so fanatical about abortion would apply their same principles to people who are already alive in the world. Sarah Palin is a creationist and that\u2019s frightening because if we allow that type of a person to be in a position to start making decisions about what is taught to kids in school, I think the results can ultimately be kind of disastrous for our country. \n<br><br>\n<br><br>14.\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">FM</span>: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">How did you get so interested in science?\n</span><br><br>ME: I\u2019ve just always loved science.

Zafran \u201909 said he was nevertheless surprised that \u201ca good third, maybe even half of the freshman class\u201d wants to become involved in the campaign.\r<br><br>\u201cI think it just goes to show that people are really enthused about this election, they\u2019re excited about Obama\u2019s candidacy, and they\u2019re ready to finally see some real change,\u201d he said.\r<br><br>In his speech, Vilsack called Nov. 4 \u201cthe most important election of my lifetime.\u201d Citing a disastrous economic situation, a poor standing on the international stage, and the energy crisis as examples of the failed policies of the Bush administration, Vilsack emphasized the need to focus on issues in this campaign. \r<br><br>His jab at McCain\u2019s choice of \u201can obscure governor\u201d won over the crowd. \u201cShe may live near Russia, but I\u2019m telling you she doesn\u2019t know a damn thing about Russia,\u201d he said to laughter and applause. \r<br><br>Vilsack also emphasized the important role students can play in getting out the vote. \r<br><br>\u201cYou ought to take it as your personal responsibility to make sure that every Democrat that you know, that every thinking Independent and Republican that you know, gets an e-mail from you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will be the difference.\u201d\r<br><br>In an interview after his speech, Vilsack said he believes young people will be important in this election. \r<br><br>He added that the opportunity to spend the fall at Harvard allows him to appear more frequently on national media outlets and to campaign throughout eastern and mid-Atlantic states on the weekends. \r<br><br>\u201cI can\u2019t overemphasize the importance of states like Maine and New Hampshire, the New England states that are important in this election,\u201d he said.\r<br><br>In fact, the Harvard College Democrats are planning to canvas key states every weekend beginning this Sunday.\r<br><br>Meanwhile, they have made it their goal to ensure that every Harvard student is registered to vote in their home state. \r<br><br>\u201cOur mission in the next couple weeks is to convince the average Harvard students that the problem sets can wait, that this is the only presidential election in their four years here, and that our future will be directly and significantly impacted by who ends up in the White House,\u201d Zafran said.\r<br><br>The attendees understood the need for youth engagement. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to make a difference, then every single person needs to get involved,\u201d Abigail B.

{"title": "The Bitter Taste of Bigotry | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Earlier this year, Senator Barack Obama stirred up controversy when he said that working-class voters were \u201cbitter\u201d because of a lack of economic opportunity.  He argued that religious bigotry, nativism, and anti-trade sentiment were an outgrowth of this frustration.  Although he phrased his sentiments poorly, Obama touched upon a valid point.  When people lose their jobs, the natural reaction for many is to blame someone else.  Immigrants, legal and illegal, are an easy scapegoat, especially during economic downturns.  Given the endless stream of bad news about the economy as of late, it is likely that embittered bigots will further demonize immigrants.  This is unfortunate, because resurgent nativism would have disastrous consequences for America\u2019s economic future.<br><br>Media demagoguery is nothing new; only now, jingoism and yellow journalism have evolved into cable news talking heads.  Along with some xenophobic politicians, they have made a living out of bashing Hispanics and Middle Easterners.  In April, a Colorado state legislator referred to Mexicans as \u201cilliterate peasants\u201d on the State House floor.   Controversial talk-show host Bill O\u2019Reilly has accused supporters of the Kennedy-McCain immigration bill of attempting to \u201cflood the country with foreign nationals.\u201d   Representative Peter King, told an interviewer that \u201cthere are too many mosques in this country,\u201d alleging that most American Muslims support radical Islam. <br><br>Unfortunately, a large percentage of Americans are as unfriendly towards immigrants as O\u2019Reilly and King.  In a recent NBC News poll, 52 percent of those surveyed believed that immigration is detrimental to America, while only 39 percent found immigration to be beneficial.  The same poll found that a slight majority of Americans saw immigrants as an economic threat. <br><br>Despite public imagination on the subject, immigration is far from an economic threat.  In fact, immigrants are tremendously beneficial to the American economy in several ways.  For one, the influx of immigrants allows America\u2019s population to grow faster than that of other industrialized nations.  This growth ensures a large supply of workers to keep Social Security solvent and the economy growing.  Without immigrants, the United States would be in the same position as Japan, Italy, and Russia, whose populations are shrinking.  The aging workforces, sclerotic economies, and massive public debts of these countries are strongly related to their loss of population.<br><br>Furthermore, highly educated immigrants bring technological prowess and entrepreneurship to the United States.  Thousands of engineers and computer scientists arrive in America yearly to fuel high-tech businesses.  Silicon Valley is filled with startups founded by immigrants, like Vinod Khosla\u2019s Sun Microsystems and Sergey Brin\u2019s Google.  Astonishingly, Congress has actually reduced the number of special H1-B visas given to foreign workers, which allow American companies to import guest workers with highly specialized knowledge.  As a result, many of these workers move to countries with more liberal immigration policies, like Canada and Australia.  In these cases, America\u2019s loss is another country\u2019s gain.<br><br>Low-skill immigrants are equally valuable to the American economy.  Many work as farm laborers, hotel maids, construction workers, and gardeners, doing work that native-born Americans are overqualified for or are unwilling to do.  Though racists often deride these workers as \u201clazy,\u201din fact, they toil long hours for little pay.  Without them, construction would grind to a halt (since 28 percent of construction workers are foreign-born) , and lettuce would cost 15 dollars a head.  It is ignorant to underestimate the impact these workers have on America\u2019s economic health. <br><br>Doubtlessly, Americans have legitimate concerns about the harmful economic effects of illegal immigration.  Undocumented aliens do not pay taxes and put an extra burden on infrastructure and social services.  But while illegal immigration is a serious problem, it is also a reflection of our dire need for comprehensive immigration reform.  While the Pat Buchanans of this country would be content to erect walls along the Mexican border, create a Fortress America, and declare the problem solved, in an increasingly global economy, fencing ourselves in is a sure path to ruin.  A combination of heightened border security, an increase in the number of visas and green cards, and a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants would be a much wiser course of action.  Similar legislation was defeated in 2006 by far-right Congressional Republicans; the next president should urge the 111th Congress to pass it.<br><br>Americans must reject bigotry and courageously welcome immigrants with open arms, especially in the face of a slowing economy.  The newest Americans just might be the ones who rescue our country from the depths of recession.<br><br><br><br>Anthony P.

{"title": "A Pitbull by Any Other Name | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Surprisingly, the most compelling performance at the Republican National Convention two weeks ago came not from the presidential nominee, but rather from his running mate, the bright new star of the Republican party: Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. As most of the international media has either enthusiastically or begrudgingly remarked, Palin did remarkably well that Wednesday night. Demonstrating her dexterity both on stage and on the attack, Madame Barracuda\u2019s speech catapulted her onto the national conservative stage with great gusto, ensuring her place on it for years to come.\n<br><br>Given the inherently cheerleading nature of convention speeches, trying to glean her executive qualifications from those forty minutes proves a dubious enterprise. More importantly, the whole issue of whether a candidate has the \u201cexperience\u201d to be President seems tricky. After all, what, exactly, qualifies one to serve as commander-in-chief? Community organizing in Chicago? A difficult and admirable task, but probably not. Over the past four years, Senator Obama seems to have become sufficiently familiar with the most pressing issues that will face the president come January 20. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s hard to make the case that he has had compelling experience making executive decisions analogous to those of war and peace, because, of course, he has not.\n<br><br>However, this is not to say that either McCain or Palin has had such experience. The key point is that there are few experiences that can genuinely prepare one for\u2014much less replicate\u2014the complex strategic tradeoffs faced by the commander-in-chief of a nation at war. A good counterexample might be commanding a wartime squadron during combat. However, as former NATO Supreme Allied Commander Wesley Clark recently pointed out, none of the current candidates can claim that experience. While valiant, Clark insisted on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, John McCain\u2019s action in Vietnam did not demand the same type of \u201cexecutive responsibility\u201d that commanding a wartime squadron would have engendered. This is not to take anything away from McCain\u2019s heroism; it is simply to say that experience is not the most pressing issue at stake when assessing the two tickets.\n<br><br>Given this relatively even playing field, the primary problem with Palin is not her gross lack of qualifications to inherit our two-front war. Rather, it has to do with what was showcased so brilliantly in St. Paul: her pitbull brand of politics. In particular, the content of the RNC speech\u2014along with her pitch-perfect delivery\u2014was dominated by a combination of massive oversimplification and a dash of jingoism on the side, peppered with arguments that appeal to visceral reactions at the expense of a nuanced stance on the most important issues facing Americans. This is nothing new. Though simple, this recipe has proven highly seductive\u2014indeed, it has served to make the recent Republican party one of the most effective electoral agents in American history.\n<br><br>For example, Palin\u2019s boiling down tax policy to \u201cHow can you possibly be better off if you\u2019re paying more taxes?\u201d is not only an inaccurate and irresponsible portrayal of the issue, but also an insult to the intelligence of the voting populace. Furthermore, to frame all those who supported the war in Iraq as \u201cpro-victory\u201d and those opposing the war as \u201cpro-forfeit\u201d is exactly the type of polarizing and impossibly simplistic dichotomy that allowed President Bush to maneuver the nation into Iraq in the first place. Between 2001 and 2003, Bush had a golden opportunity to unite and lead our country\u2014not to mention the broader international community\u2014towards a common goal with a shared purpose. Instead, Bush chose to pander to his base with divisive rhetoric and action. Judging from her convention speech, one can only conclude that a Palin administration would follow a disconcertingly similar path.\n<br><br>If Governor Palin is indeed the pitbull that she has so proudly proclaimed herself, she is a feisty and a likable one, who I am sure will prove a valuable asset for the Republicans. However, apart from her uncanny ability to galvanize the conservative base, it was her speech\u2019s heavy reliance on pitbull politics that was most troubling.\n<br><br>For all of his flaws, Senator Obama at least understands that there isn\u2019t always a gut-felt answer in decisions of state, and he is honest with his voters about the complexities of policymaking. That insight and candor alone are more valuable than any number of years experience making decisions simply by sticking to the guns and guts of oversimplistic dogma.\n<br><br><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Audrey J.

{"title": "Truth on a Diet | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>When my best friend told me she was going to spend the end of August in Maine, I felt suddenly that my resolution to monitor the two political conventions was a responsible one. How wrong I proved to be: no doubt two weeks spent away from the mass media would have been much more rewarding than savoring the political landscape as I did. The least I can do to make my \u201cvacation\u201d worthwhile is to transcribe a few of the fallacies and suspicious statements I\u2019ve heard in recent weeks.\n<br><br>Take the case of Jose E. Serrano, a charismatic Congressman from New York who said in Denver that Bronx is the poorest district located in the \u201crichest city in the world.\u201d But measured by personal net earnings, New York did not even make the global top ten last year. Did Mr. Serrano mean to make a more modest U.S.-limited comparison, perhaps? A 2005 Forbes rating by the highest median household income reveals that neither New York nor Los Angeles are among the ten richest cities, even in the United States.\n<br><br>Andrew Tobias, Democratic Party Treasurer, gave a passionate speech that could have been a highlight of the convention. But when he said: \u201cIn just the last eight years, the Republicans have cut the value of the U.S. dollar almost in half,\u201d my neck got another workout.\n<br><br>Political parties\u2014I pray their members know\u2014do not set the value of the dollar (which is a floating currency). Presidents only appoint a Chairman of the Federal Reserve who has (limited) control over the interest rates. Those rates influence the dollar\u2019s value\u2014as does demand from abroad.  In the end, a prolonged and unsustainable trade deficit is more to blame for the weakening of American currency than any one president.\n<br><br>Mr. Tobias was also one of several speakers who freely associated Republican policies with the image of bigwigs flying around in private or corporate jets. Such implications made me wonder whether these speakers read the memoir of the candidate they are so enthusiastically supporting. The Democratic nominee himself does not appear to share the outspoken belief of many delegates that using a private jet is shameful\u2014in fact, there is a well-written passage in The Audacity of Hope where Barack Obama describes just what makes flying in a private jet so enjoyable. Since this man was offered the nomination for president, maybe his party could recognize with him that wealth and vice are not synonyms.\n<br><br>The other convention in Minneapolis had its own eyebrow-raising moments. You may think equating opposition to a war with some fanciful will to surrender is a trick so old it must be collecting dust away from the top levels of American politics. If so, Senator Lindsey Graham proved you wrong, when he announced: \u201cBarack Obama\u2019s campaign is built around us losing in Iraq.\u201d It may be a red-meat line to the base, but this is certainly not a fact.\n<br><br>Once again, the media proved their inclination to pursue maximum readership, throwing to the wind the relevance and propriety of the information they provide. But I\u2019m used to some outlets resisting gossip more than others. As the Republican convention started, even The New York Times\u2019 headlines included words like \u201cFamily Problem,\u201d \u201cPalin\u2019s Daughter Pregnancy\u201d and \u201cDisclosures on Palin Raise Questions.\u201d Top journalists were splitting hairs about the extent of McCain\u2019s knowledge about Palin\u2014but the only questions successfully raised were those about the renewal of my subscription.\n<br><br>Worst of all are the laughable hypocrisies American politicos force themselves into as they try to be all things to all people. The panel on A. J. Hammer\u2019s CNN program spent more than seven convention minutes complaining about the fact that Palin\u2019s style is becoming a hot topic. \u201cIsn\u2019t it sad that we always judge women by how they look?\u201d Lisa Bloom, a panelist, said, seemingly oblivious to her own role in that phenomenon (the bottom of the screen read \u201cSarah\u2019s Style!\u201d).\n<br><br>Many journalists, when not pinpointing market failures, capably supply what sells big, and politicians know few things better than devising and repeating popular messages. I guess it can\u2019t hurt to be attentive to the news before a major change in leadership in this country. But part of me is sure I should have bought the early ticket to Maine, and skipped out on the charade. \n<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Jan Zilinsky \u201909, a Crimson editorial editor, is an economics concentrator in Mather House.</span></span></p>"}

So while a lesser man might selfishly pursue individual accomplishment by continuing to run for president even as his country faced economic disaster, the civic-minded McCain has decided to suspend his campaign and call for a postponement of the first presidential debate, originally scheduled for this Friday. As McCain courageously proclaimed yesterday, with the prospect of financial collapse looming, \u201cit\u2019s time for both parties to come together to solve this problem.\u201d \r<br><br>Or at least, so he would have you believe. In fact, McCain\u2019s proposed d\u00e9tente is little more than another tactical ploy from the desks of the Senator\u2019s Rovian political machine. \r<br><br>Our country is currently faced with two decisions of immense importance.

{"title": "Viewing Russia from Alaska | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>On September 3, Republican presidential candidate John McCain told ABC\u2019s Charles Gibson that his running mate, Alaskan governor Sarah Palin, had foreign policy experience on the grounds that \u201cAlaska is right next to Russia.\u201d Governor Palin was given the opportunity to exhibit her Russia expertise last week during her first major interview, also with Mr. Gibson, since being tagged as McCain\u2019s running mate. Although much attention remains devoted to the two wars launched by the Bush administration in Iraq and Afghanistan, Russia has emerged this summer as a major foreign policy issue this election season.\n<br><br>Ms. Palin\u2019s response to the recent Russia-Georgia conflict indicates the Republican ticket\u2019s willingness to follow in the Bush administration\u2019s footsteps when it comes to using\u2014or misusing\u2014\u201cdemocracy\u201d to justify an aggressive, bellicose foreign policy. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to keep an eye on Russia,\u201d Ms. Palin told Mr. Gibson. Referring to this summer\u2019s Russia-Georgia conflict, Ms. Palin scolded Russia for its aggressive actions in Georgia. \u201cFor Russia to have exerted such pressure in terms of invading a smaller democratic country, unprovoked, is unacceptable,\u201d she said. When pressed as to whether Russia was unprovoked, she replied that yes, it was. This, however, is not the case. \n<br><br>On the night of August 7, with most Moscovites vacationing at their dachas and Russian prime minister Vladimir Putin on his way to Beijing for the Olympic Games, Georgian troops attacked South Ossetia in an attempt to reestablish control of the region following a succession of clashes between Georgian troops and separatist forces. \n<br><br>It was only after the Georgian offensive that Russia intervened. And while Russia\u2019s response was disproportionate, one would be hard pressed to argue that Georgia did not know that their actions would provoke a Russian reaction. As James Traub wrote in The New York Times, Georgia\u2019s Columbia-educated, Western-backed president Mikheil Saakashvili \u201chas played a dangerous game of baiting the Russian bear.\u201d It seems that Mr. Saakashvilli not only may have led his now devastated country into an avoidable war, but also sparked a shift in American political discourse on Russia.\n<br><br>Although many Russians with whom I spoke with in Moscow this summer viewed Mr. Saakashvilli as a war criminal, American pundits and politicians painted the conflict as indicative of a resurgent, aggressive Russia bent on undermining democratic aspirations throughout the former Soviet space and spitting in the face of American influence in the eastern hemisphere. \n<br><br>Ms. Palin is not alone in seeing Russia as the provoker\u2014not the provoked\u2014as a country seeking to regain its former empire, to invade sovereign countries on a whim, to send a message to the world that it\u2019s back. \n<br><br>This is not to say that Russia hasn\u2019t acted aggressively to reassert itself as the dominant regional power. In 2006, to cite just one example, Gazprom, Russia\u2019s state-controlled gas conglomerate, cut off supplies to Ukraine to influence domestic Ukrainian politics. But Russia\u2019s actions toward Georgia in August cannot be viewed in a simplistic framework of unilateral Russian bullying.\n<br><br>Still, the McCain-Palin ticket has used this conflict to step up its vitriolic rhetoric. Mr. McCain wants to expel Russia from the G8 and reconsider further WTO accession talks. And both he and Ms. Palin are committed to expanding NATO to include Georgia and Ukraine. In her interview, Palin stated that the Rose Revolution in Georgia and the Orange Revolution in Ukraine \u201chave showed us that those democratic nations, I believe, should be in NATO.\u201d \n<br><br>Yet only a week ago, Ukraine\u2019s pro-Western coalition collapsed due to infighting between President Viktor Yushenko and Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, two prominent leaders of the Orange Revolution.

{"title": "Against the Wind | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>For Americans of a certain age, Ted has been the Kennedy we saw grow old, in contrast to his martyred brothers, whom we remember for their vibrancy, and whose precluded later years we can only guess at. But for the majority who are too young to recall his brothers, he has been, as one interviewer put it to me last month, a symbol of permanence in politics.\n<br><br>For myself, it seems that I have been writing about him forever, back to when John F. Kennedy \u201940 was only a first-term senator and Ted was a starting end for Harvard, catching a deflected pass in a snowstorm for a touchdown against Yale.\n<br><br>Anyone covering Congress\u2014as I did for much of 40 years\u2014covered Ted Kennedy. He was always accessible to explain what he was trying to do, the obstacles, why compromise was needed to get anything done. Sometimes his syntax was too awkward to quote directly, as if his mind was moving faster than his mouth, but you knew what he meant.\n<br><br>Newspaper headline writers use the word \u201clawmaker\u201d to describe members of Congress, most of whom can claim the title only by voting on bills. But Ted has made laws that changed the nation, building coalitions on issues from discrimination to campaign finance to health to education.  I have covered a few of his failures, notably his attempts to enact national health insurance. But there were more successes, like the 1965 immigration bill that ended national origins quotas, the creation of the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (now SCHIP) in 1997, and battles to raise the minimum wage. (\u201cIf you\u2019re not for raising the minimum wage,\u201d he told a nervous colleague, John Kerry, in 1995, \u201cyou don\u2019t deserve to call yourself a Democrat.\u201d) \n<br><br>In the late \u201970s and \u201980s, as an editor in New York, I could only read and hear about his triumphs, fighting off the Reagan Administration\u2019s attempts to retreat on civil rights and his legislative landmark, the Americans with Disabilities Act. Kennedy is a commanding orator, and I heard some of his greatest speeches. The best known is his 1980 Democratic Convention speech, when he promised that \u201cthe work goes on, the cause endures, the hope still lives, and the dream shall never die.\u201d In his health care speech in 1978, I heard him excite even the Carter supporters in the room when he attacked the President\u2019s caution: \u201cSometimes a party must sail against the wind. We cannot afford to drift or lie at anchor. We cannot heed the call of those who say it is time to furl the sail.\u201d\n<br><br>While these speeches taught me much about him, I got to know Ted best in the \u201890s while writing his biography. In 21 lengthy interviews\u2014except for Chappaquiddick, which he would not discuss\u2014he answered every question, personal or political, that I asked.\n<br><br>How did a rich young man become so interested in the poor? He talked about his grandfather, Honey Fitz, and his concern about people down on their luck, and his \u201cmother\u2019s basic religious beliefs, Sermon on the Mount, and those obligations that we all had,\u201d especially the passage from Luke: \u201cof everyone to whom much has been given, much will be required.\u201d\n<br><br>Why did he argue against Robert\u2019s running for President? A key reason, he told me though he never said it to his brother, was the fear of a second assassination. \u201cWe weren\u2019t that far away from \u201963, and that was still a factor.\u201d\n<br><br>But I learned about him from interviews with others, too. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, Robert\u2019s oldest child, told me that in the year following his death, her uncle Ted often called to talk about her younger brothers\u2019 problems. He inspired, too. \u201cHe made it his mission, I think, to make sure we felt connected to my father and to John Kennedy.\u201d\n<br><br>He has also made it his mission to keep Harvard connected to President Kennedy. The Institute of Politics (IOP) is a living memorial to his brother. Its mission \u201cto unite and engage students, particularly undergraduates, with academics, politicians, activists, and policymakers\u201d mirrors the commitment to public service Ted\u2019s own father set for his children. At the IOP, Kennedy has missed only two or three board meetings in 38 years; he speaks frequently, meets with students, and has them as interns in his office.\n<br><br>Harvard is an important part of his life. Ted made lifelong friends at college. Several worked with him early in his Senate career, and he goes to football games with them. At his 50th reunion in 2004, he spoke to his classmates about how the Senate has changed since he was first elected in 1962.\n<br><br>His other continuing Harvard connection is the faculty. He picks their brains, whether it is Robert Blendon on attitudes towards health care, David T. Ellwood \u201975 on poverty, Jennifer L. Hochschild on the American dream or many others on their particular expertise.\n<br><br>Ted made the Senate his life\u2019s work in 1982 when he decided not to make a second try for the presidency. And for all the millions the Republican Party has raised by promising to protect the nation from him, he has made the Senate work by finding allies in the other party, from Howard Baker to Bob Dole to Lauch Faircloth.\n<br><br>Two weeks ago, when the presidential candidates joined other senators in expressing their sorrow at the news of his brain tumor, they shared a special reason: For the next president to get anything done, Kennedy\u2019s talent at working across party lines is essential and exceptional. McCain, Obama, and Clinton know it.\n<br><br>His life has had its setbacks, personal and political. Perhaps the most memorable summing up came from an interview former President Bill Clinton gave me during his impeachment trial, describing Ted\u2019s message in that troubled time. He said of the sailor who has always raced at his best in rough weather: \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have a better friend. I mean, he is loyal. People have been loyal to him, and understanding, and he\u2019s had to ask for forgiveness a time or two\u2026 His advice is always simple. It\u2019s just sort of get up and go to work, just keep going, and remember why you wanted the job in the first place.\u201d\n<br><br><br>Adam Clymer \u201958, former president of The Crimson and chief Washington correspondent of the New York Times, is the author of Edward M.

{"title": "Iraq, Vietnam, and the Class of 2008 | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Senator Hillary Clinton recently offered a clumsy reminder that presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy was killed by an assassin 40 years ago this month, in June 1968. I remember it well; I was a student finishing my first year of graduate work at Harvard and it had already been a tumultuous semester. In January, the Viet Cong had struck hard against U.S. forces in Vietnam with their bloody Tet Offensive. Earlier that month my Selective Service status had been changed to 1-A, a fateful switch that took me away from Harvard and into military service the following year, after all my appeals ran out. Angered by this fate, in February and March I skipped classes, traveling to New Hampshire to campaign for anti-war candidate Senator Eugene McCarthy, who did well enough to push President Johnson out of the race\u2014and bring Bobby Kennedy in. Then in April came the shocking assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., followed by rioting in more than 100 American cities. \n<br><br>Earlier that spring Harvard\u2019s senior class had invited King to speak at their Class Day exercises. His widow, Coretta Scott King, now had to come to Cambridge to speak in his place. On June 12, exactly one week after the Kennedy killing, Mrs. King admonished the Class of 1968 to \u201cspeak out with righteous indignation\u201d against what she called \u201cthe forces which are seeking to destroy us.\u201d  \n<br><br>Young people took this message to heart all across the country. Angry protesters filled the streets at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago two months later, provoking helmeted police into a brutal assault. At Harvard the following spring, in 1969, students took over University Hall to protest the institution\u2019s alleged complicity in the Vietnam War, once again provoking a police incursion, followed by a student \u201cstrike\u201d that shut down the university.  \n<br><br>Today, America is trapped again in a damaging military project abroad, yet few have taken to the streets. Harvard\u2019s Class of 2008 enjoyed a tame final semester, without any takeovers of University Hall. This irritates some from my generation who would like to see today\u2019s college students responding with a bit more \u201crighteous indignation\u201d to the war in Iraq. We denigrate today\u2019s youth as too coddled and self-absorbed to care. Not fearing military service, thanks to an all-volunteer army, today\u2019s students can afford focus their energies on resume building, graduation parties, and summer travel plans. During the four years that the Class of 2008 was at Harvard, our nation\u2019s leaders have persisted in an Iraq policy that brings rising economic, political, and moral costs, yet where is the outrage?\n<br><br>My impressions of the Class of 2008, gained during my admittedly brief visit this spring, are a bit different. What I have noticed is considerable seriousness of purpose, both in and out of class, and remarkably little self-absorption. Nobody tried to take over University Hall this spring, but quite a few of my students did give up long weekends without sleep or pay to campaign for their favorite candidates in New Hampshire, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. Instead of seeking change through self-indulgent and often self-defeating street tactics, these students sought a path to change in Iraq\u2014and in other areas\u2014through disciplined election work. And they got results, mobilizing enough caucus goers and primary voters to upset the Democratic Party establishment and give the insurgent Obama campaign a grip on the nomination. If these efforts are sustained, Barack Obama will win the election in November and bring a younger look and a new approach to national politics. Contrast this strategy to the less disciplined street tactics used back in 1968, tactics that triggered a conservative backlash and helped elect Richard Nixon.  \n<br><br>The Harvard students who became active in electoral politics this spring were part of a much larger national political phenomenon. The 2008 primary season was filled with many twists and turns, yet one dominating constant was the increased turnout of voters under age 30, and not all in support of Obama. In Massachusetts the turnout of young voters doubled compared to 2000, with Clinton actually doing better than Obama among those under 30. In Missouri, the youth vote tripled, carrying both Obama and Huckabee to a win. In Georgia, the youth vote also tripled compared to 2000, and in Tennessee, the youth vote quadrupled.\n<br><br>Patterns of civic engagement among young Americans do remain to some extent divided between this new cohort willing to bet on traditional politics to bring change, and those who prefer non-political engagement through volunteering, community service, and education work.  Yet both are proven options, and both are far more effective than street theatre, or simple indignation. Today\u2019s young people appear to have learned, from someone, that results matter. So, graduates from the past: take a lesson from the Class of 2008.   \n<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Robert A.

{"title": "Where Do the Democrats Go From Here? | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Clay A. Dumas", "body": "<p><span>Last week the commentariat was bemoaning the possibility that Hillary Clinton would take her fight about Florida and Michigan all the way to the convention. But, she has since signaled that she will bow out on Friday. The \u201cstruggle\u201d is now shifting to the question of whether Hillary will be chosen as Obama\u2019s running mate. Certainly there are Hillary supporters who are transmuting their ardor for her presidential candidacy into a desire to see her round out the ticket. But Hillary is not trying to \u201cmuscle\u201d her way onto the ticket. Surely if she wanted the vice-presidential nomination, endorsing Obama sooner rather than later is the order of the day. \n<br><br>Even more to the point: Obama will choose his running mate on his own terms, and intruding on his decision will only backfire. Is there much prospect for an Obama-Clinton ticket? There are two considerations: How would it affect the election and how would it affect an Obama administration? \n<br><br>The first reaction one hears from many commentators and diehard Obama-ites is that the selection of Hillary would deflate his base and tarnish him with two decades worth of Clinton history. However, if choosing a running mate is all it would take to deflate Obama\u2019s support or image, then he isn\u2019t the successor to JFK and Reagan that so many hope he can be (the two big charisma kings chose the distinctly un-charismatic Lyndon B. Johnson and George H.W. Bush as their running mates). \n<br><br>Because of her peculiar base of support, Hillary currently does better in general election match-ups against John McCain than Obama does. To be sure, it\u2019s virtually impossible to predict how voters will feel about the candidates in November. After all, even a month and half before the Democratic primaries kicked off, Hillary was leading in South Carolina and in 24 of 25 Super Tuesday states. Nevertheless, we\u2019re now in June and there is a lot of mileage on this campaign. People really know Obama, Hillary, and McCain, and a case can be made that the general election will never reach the intensity of the primaries we\u2019ve just been through. By this point, it\u2019s definitely food for thought that in key swing states Ohio and Pennsylvania, Hillary beats McCain decisively in polls, and enjoys a moderate six to seven point lead over McCain in Florida. Obama, by contrast, has tenuous leads in Ohio and Pennsylvania, and hardly competes in Florida. And in North Carolina, a state whose primary Obama won handily, it\u2019s Hillary who\u2019s in striking distance to McCain, not Obama. \n<br><br>Democrats have a lot to be optimistic about. We have a tremendous fund-raising advantage, we\u2019ve enjoyed far higher participation rates in the primaries (there\u2019s a correlation between primary and general election participation), and the Republican Party is profoundly unpopular. \n<br><br>Yet, it should be disconcerting that Barack still doesn\u2019t have a clear edge in the polls, and that efforts to re-brand McCain\u2014who nearly left the Republican party several years ago and has an extensive record of introducing bipartisan legislation\u2014as \u201cGeorge W. Bush 2.0\u201d have gained no traction. Bolstering the ticket with the candidate who gained the support of the demographic segments that stubbornly eluded Obama in the primaries will almost certainly be a positive in November. \n<br><br>Chemistry on the campaign trail? Prior to his announcement that he would run, there was, by all reports, a good personal relationship between Hillary and Obama, and to the extent that it thereafter deteriorated, it mostly came from her end. Obama kept his cool throughout and appears to have genuine respect for her. Considering the duration and the intensity of the contest, her attacks against him have been mild by historical standards.\n<br><br>Would Obama\u2019s message of change be sullied by her involvement? Any running mate will be chosen to give Obama national security credentials and/or bolster his support with Hillary\u2019s base, and will almost certainly be older and more associated with the \u201cestablishment.\u201d \n<br><br>The bottom line is that the primaries were a virtual tie however you slice and dice the popular vote. The two leading Democrats, while extremely close on policy, had the visceral support of distinct segments of the population. Obama won because he had the best ground game. He ran the better campaign in relation to raising money and obtaining the support of delegates. Also, in what was partly a generational conflict, he represented the younger generation, always a plus. Yet, although he has had a significant fundraising advantage since before the primaries began and was anointed the presumptive nominee as early as February when he won eight primaries in a row, he has made scant progress with Hillary\u2019s half of the electorate. Maybe he\u2019s Saint Francis Assisi, Abraham Lincoln, and Ronald Reagan rolled into one and won\u2019t need any help with any segment of the population going into the fall. But the available evidence is that the \u201cReagan Democrat\u201d has had qualms about voting for Democratic presidential candidates since 1968, votes his or her pocketbook, not some ideological vision, and isn\u2019t yet sold on Obama in spite of six months of the most intense campaigning this country has ever seen. Choosing Hillary would be an insurance policy against the possibility Obama\u2019s support will not grow beyond his base.\n<br><br>How about once an Obama/Clinton team took office? One can argue about whether Hillary would be too independent and conspicuous, diminishing Obama\u2019s authority. This is a legitimate concern, particularly with Bill Clinton lurking in the background, but I am not as worried as others that Hillary wouldn\u2019t know how to play her role appropriately. She showed incredible discipline in fitting into her position in the Senate. As for Bill, while he might have been a weird presence in a Hillary presidency, why indication is there that he intrude any more into her Vice-Presidency than he has into her Senate career.\n<br><br>More importantly, what would the effect of having Hillary inside the administration be on Obama\u2019s ability to lead? The next administration is going to have to make some difficult choices on matters affecting its core constituencies. There is looming generational conflict about health care reform and entitlement spending. Hispanics and working class whites and blacks are likely to have varying perspectives on immigration reform. Well-traveled, tech-savvy young college graduates are going to view globalization and international environmental crises a little differently from laid-off manufacturing workers in Ohio and Pennsylvania. \n<br><br>I\u2019m not suggesting that a President Clinton would deal with these issues all that differently from President Obama. What I am suggesting is that Clinton already has the trust of segments of the electorate that may vote for Obama in November but may never warm to him. Inside the administration she may have the capacity to reassure key segments of the Democratic coalition on potentially divisive issues. Outside the administration, she will be like any politician: Her traditional base will look to her to protect their interests and she will respond accordingly. The future is hard to predict, but the very serious problems this country faces hold much potential for new and significant fissures in the body politic. A unified Democratic ticket is the best insurance for holding the country together. \n<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Clay A.

{"title": "Condoleezza Rice for VP? | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Few predicted that the New York Giants\u2019 blitz would unseat the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl. Few predicted that presidential hopeful Ron Paul could raise nearly $35 million for his campaign.  History has shown time and again that success can often come unexpectedly. Though it is not widely predicted, the Democratic Party will encounter a formidable challenge if John McCain selects Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice as his vice presidential running mate. Rice may not be the first candidate for Vice President that comes to mind, but then again many winning strategies are not immediately apparent. \n<br><br>Although Rice does not fit the archetype of an American conservative, her views and policy are right-wing. She is respected in the Republican community and has a close relationship with President George W. Bush. She is religious enough to attract voters in the socially conservative Bible belt. However, unlike your typical Dick Cheney Republican, she appeals to typically Democratic demographics. Black women, who usually vote Democratic, may be inclined to give the Republican ticket a second look if they see someone on the ballot who personally understands their struggle as black women. Rice is intimately familiar with black issues. She was actually there in 1963 when the Ku Klux Klan bombed Birmingham\u2019s sixteenth Street Baptist Church killing four young girls. In an interview with 60 Minutes Rice remembered, \u201cWell, we knew those little girls. Denise McNair was my little friend from kindergarten. And she was a playmate and I just couldn't believe that she was dead.\u201d \n<br><br>During the election season, the point of a vice presidential running mate is not to set policy, but to increase the presidential candidate\u2019s appeal in a wider election. In this regard, Rice is particularly helpful to Republicans.  Rice has strong foreign policy and national security experience, and has never had to place a single vote in the U.S. Senate that would have positioned her opposite the Republican establishment. Consequently, she will appeal to a different Republican demographic than John McCain will. McCain is widely known as a maverick whose votes have not always aligned with most Republicans. Although he has publicly denied it, McCain is heavily rumored to have considered leaving the Republican Party in 2001. In an interview with The Hill, former Senator of South Dakota Tom Daschle said there were intensive talks to bring him over to the Democrats.  This history will not incentivize disenchanted Republican voters to turn out in the 2008 presidential election. Rice, on the other hand, is a Republican through and through. In her tenure as Secretary of State she has become particularly well-versed on diplomacy in the Middle-East, the Iraq War, and homeland security. This may bring McCain\u2019s disenchanted Republican voters back to their local poll stations.\n<br><br>Rice will also undermine the Democratic Party\u2019s monopoly on the message of change. The party who will nominate either a black man or a white woman will suddenly have to run against a party with a black woman on the ballot. This gives the Republicans legitimate claim to the concept of change. \n<br><br>If Rice were on the Republican ticket, this would allow the Republican political machine to be more robust then previously allowed. The Republicans could use arguments like \u201cIs America ready for\u2026?\u201d without being called racist or sexist. They could critique Rev. Wright more strongly and scrutinize Hillary Clinton\u2019s reaction to her husband\u2019s relationship with Monica Lewinski. The Democrats\u2019 response that these Republican-driven criticisms are steeped in racism and misogyny will fall short, because the Republican Party will have a black person and a woman\u2014all in one\u2014on the ballot. In this way, Rice will be a grand foil for the Republicans. \n<br><br>More than just a convenient foil for Republicans, Rice is extremely smart and cunning. She will not say something to the press that will get McCain in trouble. She will probably win her debates by means of her cold intellect. The Democrats may not be able to find a vice presidential candidate who can match Rice in her time-tested conservative foreign policy expertise. With her deep public policy background as a National Security Advisor to President Bush and then Secretary of State, Rice has the credentials to lead the country at anytime should the need arise. \n<br><br>Finally, Rice will give Republicans something to get excited about. Since when have Republicans had a young and energizing candidate? Her novelty will engender Obama-esque press. Because Rice is not the obvious choice for vice president, many will be captivated. In this modern age where the media and the photo-op are pivotal, Rice will keep the Republican Party on the airwaves.\n<br><br>According to Republican insider Tom Senor, \u201cCondi Rice has been actively, actually in recent weeks, campaigning [to be McCain\u2019s running mate].\u201d  While McCain was on the camping trail, The New York Times asked him about this.  He claimed that thus far he has \u201cmissed those signals\u201d  for a McCain/Rice \u201908 ticket. But a few minutes later he added, \u201cI think she\u2019s a great American, I think there\u2019s very little that I can say that isn\u2019t anything but the utmost praise for a great American citizen, who served as a role model to so many millions of people in this country and around the world,\u201d Mr. McCain added that \u201cher overall record is very, very meritorious.\u201d  We can expect to see Rice given substantial consideration for the Vice Presidential spot in the McCain Campaign. It would be a highly unexpected and highly effective move. \n<br><br>\n<br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">George Hayward '11, a Crimson editorial editor, lives in Currier House. \n</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br></span></p>"}
{"title": "The Measure of a Man | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>It comes perhaps as no surprise that Americans appreciate above all things the need for a stout, bright heart in the White House. After all, George Washington certainly did; his book of maxims (distributed, free of charge, to generations of American schoolchildren) includes this resolution: \u201cI hope I shall always possess firmness and virtue enough to maintain what I consider the most enviable of all titles, the character of an Honest Man.\u201d\n<br><br>While today we might feel compelled to use the language of gender neutrality, the same sentiment prevails. We want from our leaders not an aristocrat\u2019s aloofness but the broad appeal of a character whittled smooth by hard work and strong values, one given not to bombast but to good country straight talk\u2014be that over potatoes and Yuengling in Altoona, Pennsylvania, or fried steak and Lost Duck in Altoona, Iowa. With some unabashed image engineering, it turns out, nothing else really matters.\n<br><br>This much seems obvious in light of recent bids at de-starching the whitest collars for election: be he a millionaire actor or a dyed-in-the-cashmere Connecticut Yankee, your candidate can also be Washington\u2019s \u201cHonest Man\u201d\u2014firm and virtuous enough, at least, to win the White House.\n<br><br>This strategy was never stretched to its limits until 2004, however, when a blue-blooded Yale graduate and oil executive who pulled strings to duck Vietnam was cast as the anti-elitist, the living, breathing Good Ol\u2019 Boy to John Kerry\u2019s pharaonic mummy. A September poll that year showed that\u2014war be damned\u2014nearly 60 percent of undecided voters would prefer having a beer with Bush. Pundits pounced, and Republican staffers rejoiced: The plan had worked.\n<br><br>Not without a little elbow grease, though. Team Crawford had been running damage control for more than a decade, trying to keep a long youth\u2014marked chiefly by a drunk-driving arrest and a 2.35 grade point average\u2014from interfering with political destiny. To quote the president himself, at his question-begging best: \u201cWhen I was young and irresponsible, I was young and irresponsible.\u201d\n<br><br>On that team was baby-faced Texan politico Scott McClellan, one of W\u2019s spokesmen since 1999. Mr. McClellan was on hand in August of that year to deflect allegations of cocaine abuse, replying only that his employer had \u201clearned from his mistakes.\u201d Finding Laura, finding Jesus, and abandoning the B &amp; B: a bad-boy-gone-golden narrative is always preferable to the sanctimony of lifelong sobriety.\n<br><br>That October, when primary opponent and then-maverick John McCain raged against an article he suggested Bush staffers planted, Mr. McClellan was there, too, wondering aloud where the boss could not: \u201cWe\u2019re somewhat puzzled at the way Senator McCain is reacting. It\u2019s totally ridiculous to think that we control what The New York Times writes.\u201d\n<br><br>The thing about Bush\u2019s celebrated political Teflon is that it rarely involves the candidate alone; rather, a staff of loyal vassals works\u2014and works hard\u2014to subtly detect, derail and discredit all threats, like dogs wandering a minefield.\n<br><br>This dynamic was most excruciatingly apparent during Mr. McClellan\u2019s tenure as White House Press Secretary. Conferences took on the character of one-sided dodgeball matches. Years into his relationship with Bush, after the big guy had called him a \u201cgood man\u201d for the job, McClellan could be seen daily, sweating through David Gregory\u2019s heartless probing and engaging in all the party-line prevarication his job description came to entail.\n<br><br>Perhaps McClellan\u2019s resignation in 2006 was for him a merciful release; for Bush, it was part of a politically prudent changing of the guard, after midterm elections revealed the precise limits of \u201clikeability.\u201d At this point, most centrist Americans had rethought their earlier decision, and preferred to take their hypothetical beer for the road.\n<br><br>So Scott left the building, practically invisible in the noisy exodus of Messrs. Card, Rumsfeld, Rove, and Gonzales. Two years have elapsed since Bush bid his friend and mouthpiece farewell with this prediction: \u201cOne of these days, he and I are going to be rocking in chairs in Texas talking about the good old days of his time as the press secretary. And I can assure you, I will feel the same way then that I feel now, that I can say to Scott, job well done.\u201d\n<br><br>For a while, it looked as though Bush\u2019s predictive abilities might not be as bad as they seemed. In April of 2007, Scott McClellan reappeared on \u201cReal Time with Bill Maher\u201d\u2014a private citizen, but still Bush\u2019s proxy\u2014to go head-to-head with former Sen. Bill Bradley. Repeatedly asked to lay out the rationale for the catastrophic war in Iraq, the once-and-future spokesman stammered back: \u201cNo, let me talk about where we are right now\u2026We can do\u2014we went in\u2014we went in\u2014because that\u2019s already been laid out.\u201d\n<br><br>Today, even that seems long ago. But the more things change, the more they stay the same. Bill Maher\u2019s still on the air, the New York Times is still dressing down Sen. McCain, and George W. Bush is still existentially, even blissfully, puzzled. Only the object has changed, to McClellan himself\u2014or at least so says current Press Secretary Dana Perino.\n<br><br>After months of rumbling, the press corps\u2019 one-time whipping-boy has spoken up for himself in a new book, \u201cWhat Happened: Inside the Bush White House and Washington\u2019s Culture of Deception.\u201d In it, McClellan labels some of his public statements as propaganda and attributes Bush\u2019s fall from grace to a Machiavellian lack of candor among top advisors like Karl Rove.\n<br><br>Much ado has been made about the book. Beyond the bemusement of McClellan\u2019s former comrades, former Sen. Bob Dole\u2014getting sentimental in his old age\u2014called its author a \u201cmiserable creature\u201d who \u201ccashed in,\u201d while Democratic Congressman Robert Wexler has asked that McClellan officially bite the hand that fed him before the House Judiciary Committee. For his part, the former fall guy has only cited a new \u201cloyalty to the truth,\u201d one that supplants his former allegiance to the president.\n<br><br>Of course, it would be hard to cast What Happened as an admirable confession; it seems that McClellan waited a little too long to drop a dime on his former employer. Even in it, a rosy tint lingers around the image of Mr. Bush himself. McClellan calls him \u201csincere,\u201d and displaces blame onto Rove and his ilk.\n<br><br>What is most interesting about the book, though, is what it says about the fleeting spell of Bush loyalty; the rhetorical Red-Rover that formed up around the president can be broken up, after all. It draws into relief the startling extent to which modern politics have become a merciless team sport\u2014the great sins of the last seven years would never have been possible without diffusion, delegation, and the occasional concession at the margins\u2014a Cabinet member here or there, one counsel for another.\n<br><br>But what about the captain? The verdict is still out, though we may proceed with another maxim in mind. In his Strength to Love, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., wrote: \u201cThe ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.\u201d McClellan\u2019s career, like many others\u2019, was spent concealing President Bush, absorbing his controversies, and dismissing the many challenges made in decision after poor, duplicitous decision.\n<br><br>With the revelations made in the past week, Americans ought to wonder whether they have ever actually seen this president stare down a storm on his own, and whether he has ever, with the privilege of principle and information on his side, overruled the bleak drumbeat of his \u00e9minence grise. And, if not, we may be forced to ask if he is instead merely a overgrown boy, coasting along a dark sea\u2014full of bravado, without a care, and with all of us in tow.\n<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">James M.

{"title": "Newark Mayor to Address HLS | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>When Cory A. Booker took office as mayor of Newark, N.J. in 2006, he assumed responsibility for a city torn by crime, economic instability, and explosive racial tensions.\r<br><br>Booker, an Yale-educated lawyer, ran on platform of reforming the city\u2019s government and reducing crime. Since taking office, his mayoral agenda\u2014which some consider too idealistic for the harsh reality of Newark, which was decimated following notorious race riots in 1967 riots\u2014has been closely monitored by his constituents and the national media alike.\r<br><br>This heavy dose of idealism is what the future lawyers who graduate from Harvard Law School may receive when Booker gives the Class Day speech tomorrow.\r<br><br>Just one year after graduating from Yale Law School in 1997, Booker moved into a $547 per month apartment in one of Newark\u2019s worst public housing projects, a massive, mud-colored, 300-unit building that was demolished in December 2007.\r<br><br>Despite the fact that he is staking his political career on turning around the fortunes of a troubled city, Booker himself hails from a predominantly white, neighborhood in suburban Bergen County. His pedigree is glaringly elite: after graduating from Stanford, where he also took a master\u2019s degree, Booker attended Oxford on a Rhodes scholarship before attending Yale for law school. \r<br><br>In 2002, Booker made his first run for mayor of Newark, losing narrowly to a veteran machine politician who painted Booker as a \u201ccarpetbagger.\u201d\r<br><br>After briefly leaving politics to build a legal practice, Booker returned to Newark politics in 2006, winning the mayoral election by a landslide. His opponent from 2002, who served as mayor of Newark for two decades, was convicted of five counts of fraud in April from charges stemming from land deals he had made in office. \r<br><br>Booker\u2019s place in the political spotlight is nearly as closely monitored as that of other Ivy-league educated, black politicians\u2014namely Barack Obama, n Law School graduate who the mayor has vocally supported in the 2008 presidential campaign, and Deval L. Patrick \u201978, another Law School graduate who is also the only black governor in the country.\r<br><br>Megan E. Ryan, one of four Class Marshals for the Law School\u2019s class of 2008, said that Booker\u2019s message would speak to students because \u201cit was a chance to hear from someone who had given back to really needy communities.\u201d \r<br><br>Ryan said that she and the other class Marshals were looking for a speaker who like Patrick, could speak to the use of a law degree in the public interest. \r<br><br>During his year and half in office, Booker has keep busy in his effort to curb Newark\u2019s crime rate and establish his legacy and reputation as the city\u2019s reformer.\r<br><br>His time as mayor has been met with some successes. Violent crime in Newark has declined for the first time since 2002, and the mayor continues to add new projects a growing list aimed at transforming the city.\r<br><br>Douglas H. Lasdon, Booker\u2019s former supervisor at the Urban Justice Center said the he is confident in his ability to rise to the challenge that Newark represents. \r<br><br>\u201cHe\u2019s got excellent judgement,\u201d Lasdon said. \u201cHe\u2019s made to be a politician in the most honorable sense of the word.\u201d \r<br><br>\u2014Staff writer Abby D.

Lee", "body": "<p><span>Before our swim meets, my high school swim coach would often say, \u201cClose your eyes and just imagine.\u201d Imagine crouching low on the starting blocks as you wait for the starting gun. Imagine standing on the winners\u2019 platform with your medal draped around your neck. If it\u2019s possible now in your mind, he\u2019d tell us, it\u2019s possible in the pool.\n<br><br>It is our ability to dream that puts the impossible within our reach. Our hopes, our aspirations, our own narratives\u2014they weave like strands into the very fabric of our life stories and our outlook on the future. For me, it is the power of these life stories that drew me to politics. My mother\u2019s selfless sacrifice to provide her two sons with endless opportunities inspired me to service. Recently, Senator Barack Obama\u2019s mission to change the way politics is run encouraged me to become involved in politics for the first time. Moreover, my own experience working on Senator Obama\u2019s campaign showed me that our politics have the potential to inspire and empower rather than divide and discourage.\n<br><br>My story begins with my mother\u2019s improbably quest to achieve the American Dream. In 1985, my mother immigrated to the United States from South Korea. She knew very little English and had little money. The accomplishments, the status, the connections that she had back home meant nothing here. The college degree for which she labored so hard in Korea was useless. So, my mother started all over as she held on to a simple conviction\u2014that with determination, she would be able to provide her two sons the opportunities these new shores had to offer. At the age of 29, she enrolled as an undergraduate at the University of Washington and worked the evening shift at a retail jewelry store. She came home from school and work every day to take care of her family and to work on her own problem sets and papers.\n<br><br>As she juggled her many responsibilities, she never failed to read my brother and me stories before she tucked us into bed. These weren\u2019t simply fairy tales\u2014they weren\u2019t just Dr. Seuss, Disney, or Humpty Dumpty. She also read us biographies\u2014stories about JFK\u2019s hope for a better America, Abraham Lincoln\u2019s vision for a unified nation, and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.\u2019s fight for a nation healed and restored. And each night as I fell asleep listening to the dream of Dr. King, his dream became my own. His vision for the future seeped into my own understanding about what was possible. Just as my mother would go on to receive her Ph.D. and become a professor, she invoked these stories to teach me that with faith and determination, anything is possible.\n<br><br>My mother\u2019s example showed me that we must not become complacent with the world as it is, but rather we must envision the world as it should be. During the summer and fall of 2007, I took a leave of absence from college to work for the Obama campaign on the New Hampshire New Media team. As I blogged and edited videos of his daily events, I watched him draw people of all backgrounds. It was their stories that strengthened my faith in Obama\u2019s ability to transform this nation. It was the wife of a war veteran who held signs at rallies so that no other solder would share her husband\u2019s fate. It was the cancer patient who made phone calls to make sure that all Americans had affordable health care. It was the senior citizen who canvassed for hours in the pouring rain to ensure that his grandchildren would have a better future. Through them, I found that the things that bind us are greater than what divides us.\n<br><br>Senator Obama is a leader who unifies this country around its common values. He is a visionary who will lead and reshape the nation rather than simply mend it. His candidacy is our chance to restore this simple dream for generations to come and imagine a better tomorrow. We imagine a future where our bold young men and women are no longer shipped overseas to fight a war that should never have been waged. We imagine a future in which senior citizens no longer have to cut pills and forgo medicine in order to afford their healthcare. We imagine a future in which we can save our planet and end our dependence on foreign oil. We imagine a future in which we can reclaim the American Dream for all people, of all religions, of all economic status, of all sexual orientations and all racial identities. Ultimately, Obama inspires us to realize that these desirable ends can only be accomplished if we come together as one nation.\n<br><br>As graduates walk across the stage this week to commemorate their time at Harvard, they turn the page of their own life stories. They imagine the endless opportunities to change the world and write the next great chapter of American history. Society is sure to meet these hopes with cynicism. Pundits are sure to embrace a politics of \u201cNo you can\u2019t.\u201d They will surely posit that such dreams are na\u00efve and irrational.\n<br><br>But that\u2019s what hope is for. The same hope that led my mother to cross an ocean to start all over. The same hope that millions of Americans continue to believe in as they imagine a brighter future. The same hope that Senator Obama has to offer all Americans. This is the hope that we as graduates must hold strong to. It is the ingredient that has brought us this far. And it is the fuel that moves us closer to the impossible.\n<br><br>Close your eyes and just imagine; because if it is possible now in your minds, it is possible out there.\n<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Edward Y.

{"title": "A Changing Climate on College Campuses | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Since the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, virtually every indicator in the fight against climate change has continued to head the wrong way. The planet\u2019s temperature continues to rise. Industrial activity is increasing, and with it greenhouse gases. Vehicle miles travelled, a key indicator of the public\u2019s concern, has risen steadily before taking a slight dip in the most recent quarter, due to higher fuel prices.\n<br><br>Do-little politicians have earned the ire and distrust of the public for placing electoral self-interest ahead of sound policies and a guiding hand, but clearly they do so with a certain comfort that any public backlash will be muted. Even the newly re-minted Warner-Lieberman bill, which aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by 2050, appears destined to fail.\n<br><br>Nowhere has the absence of forward-looking environmental stewardship been more evident this year than in the debate over new Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards (CAF\u00c9). The U.S. automakers argued to congress that Americans don\u2019t want the kinds of cars that are needed to dramatically reduce the one-third of total emissions that come from the transportation sector. In the end, the American automakers were given a pass by the country\u2019s elected officials to continue placing heft and horsepower ahead of what is right for the country and the planet.\n<br><br>Many have chosen to believe that with a change in administration will usher in an \u201cenvironmental spring\u201d in this country. A fairer appraisal is that while President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney have earned the jeers of those concerned about climate change, they have also been convenient lightning rods while Congress has quietly gone about its business of not doing enough.\n<br><br>Senator Barack Obama\u2019s messages of hope and commitment have clearly struck a chord with many voters who seem to want change. Senator John McCain\u2019s environmental platform is perhaps the most complete of all of the candidates and could also be a strong first step in the right direction. But while one should never underestimate the rhetorical power of the presidency, one must remember that the vested interests in Washington for the status quo can wear down even the most energetic leader.\n<br><br>This is where you, the Harvard community comes in.\n<br><br>By all measures, you are gifted. You were endowed with the intelligence, drive and energy to get here and you have been endowed with the tools to make a difference in the world. \n<br><br> \u201cWhen you consider what those of us here have been given in talent, privilege and opportunity, there is almost no limit to what the world has a right to expect from us,\u201d Microsoft founder Bill Gates said at last year\u2019s commencement ceremonies, urging graduates to fight against inequities in the world. The expectation that the greatest hardships from climate change will befall the world\u2019s poorest countries only heightens the need for action.\n<br><br>\u201cIn line with the promise of this age, I want to exhort each of the graduates here to take on an issue\u2014a complex problem, a deep inequity, and become a specialist on it\u2026For a few hours every week, you can use the growing power of the Internet to get informed, find others with the same interests, see the barriers, and find ways to cut through them.\u201d\n<br><br>Gates is someone who understands the power of those who can harness the Internet. One need look no farther than the anti-globalization movement of the last decade to see how a concerned public can be mobilized over the Internet. A grassroots campaign that brought together a myriad of small groups first undermined political support for the Multilateral Agreement on Investment and then effectively derailed any hopes of advancement of liberalized trade in the Doha round of negotiations at the World Trade Organization.\n<br><br>Whether one believes those setbacks to the pro-trade agenda were good things is irrelevant. What\u2019s important is that they were effective in seizing the attention of politicians who faced electoral defeat, and business owners who faced boycotts of their products. And what made the campaign effective was that it got people talking and made them think about the kind of world they wanted.\n<br><br>Many of these same conditions exist today in the climate change debate. It\u2019s not that people haven\u2019t been talking before this, it\u2019s that now, people seem ready to listen and to try to understand. It\u2019s a crowded field and cutting through the din and disinformation will take considerable effort to make climate change a ballot issue in every local, state, and federal race. \n<br><br>Campuses have long been the source of the energy and intelligence needed to bring about change, and never has it been more needed than now. \n<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">James Baxter is the Martin Wise Goodman Canadian Nieman Fellow.\n</span><br><br></span></p>"}
{"title": "The Promise of Change | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Nothing short of the U.S presidential race could have eclipsed the incompetence and the dishonesty of the Bush administration. At a time when our nation faces some of its toughest challenges\u2014globalization, climate change, the War on Terror, and healthcare\u2014this administration has lacked both the policy foresight and the support of the American people to effect any meaningful change. Despite Bush\u2019s failures, however, we are optimistic that with the right leadership, our nation will be able to overcome our problems as we\u2019ve done so many times before. \n<br><br>One of the most salient offenses of the Bush administration has been its blatant abuse of the balance of power between the branches of government. Bush has repeatedly tried to undermine the Congressional power through his use of signing statements\u2014written pronouncements effectively allowing the executive branch to ignore parts of legislation. A Pulitzer Prize-winning expos\u00e9 by Charles C. Savage \u201998 in The Boston Globe uncovered that Bush had claimed the authority to ignore more than 750 laws enacted between 2001 and 2006\u2014laws regulating everything from affirmative action to torture.\n<br><br>Sadly, the missteps in the handling of the War on Terror\u2014most notably, the interrogation techniques used at Abu Ghraib and the treatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay\u2014have been extremely damaging to the perception of America both at home and abroad. While many Washington insiders have been less than forthright about their stance on the controversial interrogation techniques, we believe now just as we did then that waterboarding is torture, and should never be condoned or practiced by the U.S. The Bush administration, however, has had no qualms with trying to pull the wool over the American people\u2019s eyes again\u2014top government officials were not only complicit in the destruction of interrogation footage, but also attempted to divert blame for the prisoner abuse scandal on a \u201cfew bad apples.\u201d\n<br><br>No doubt, history will not look well upon this administration, but there are still some positive steps this administration can take\u2014be it the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol or the much-needed move to  sever all ties with mercenary armies, starting with the expulsion of Blackwater U.S.A. (which at one point held a $1.2 billion contract with the U.S government and supplied up to 30000 private security guards in Iraq). \n<br><br>In addition to our problems on the international front, domestic policy under the Bush administration has been horribly misguided\u2014from the death penalty to gay marriage to gun laws. The inhumane practice of lethal injection and other forms of capital punishment are still tolerated, and the Supreme Court has yet to ban what is effectively state-sanctioned murder. The constitutional right to marry and the right to equal protection under the law are still denied to same-sex couples in the majority of states (with notable exceptions in Massachusetts, and more recently, California). High school shootings and other gun violence incidents are ever-raging, yet constitutional debates over the interpretation of the Second Amendment cloud the fact that this the \u201cright to bear arms\u201d is an anachronistic impediment to the vital public policy that is needed to fight the culture of gun violence in the U.S.\n<br><br>While the hope of a new commander-in-chief brings with it requisite optimism, the process of electing a new president has not been free of scrutiny. Rather, the most recent cycle of caucuses and primaries has only underscored the problems with our election system. The staggered calendar has given undue influence to a handful of states with early primaries and caucuses\u2014rendering the contests of states that vote late in the schedule almost meaningless. Most undemocratic has been the superdelegate system, which may, for the first time in recent electoral history, determine the candidate for the Democratic Party. One mere vote from a superdelegate at the Democratic convention may just as valuable as the thousands of votes cast by individual citizens, despite the tenets of democracy that champion the notion of one man one vote. Further complicating the democratic process was a misguided Supreme Court decision that upheld the constitutionality of requiring government-issued photo identification, making it that much easier to silence those demographics that are less likely acquire a state ID.\n<br><br>Nonetheless, this presidential race will be a historic one\u2014not only because an African American and a woman are vying for the Democratic nomination, but also because of the magnitude and the complexity of the issues we face. As the Democratic contest continues to rage on, we are heartened at a potential (even likely) Obama victory\u2014for his the only candidate that provides both the leadership and the policy stances needed to tackle those pressing issues. And while we endorsed Senator McCain as the Republican nominee, we still have many reservations about his policy\u2014specifically dealing with the war in Iraq. \n<br><br>It is disappointing, however, to see media coverage of the elections focus on identity politics instead of the candidates\u2019 substantive issues. Even more disappointing has been the way in which both Senator Clinton and Senator Obama have stooped to new lows of campaigning in the race for the democratic nomination. Whether it is Obama advisor Samantha Power\u2019s comment about the \u201cmonster\u201d Senator Clinton, or Senator\u2019s Clinton opportunistic response to Senator Obama\u2019s \u201celitist\u201d comment about rural America, negative campaigning threatens only hurt the Democratic party\u2019s chance in the general election. \n<br><br>It\u2019s time to refocus this election on the issues facing the future of our nation. After eight years with a dysfunctional, disingenuous government, the presidential race is not only our hope for the future, but it is our promise of change.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Jonathan Kozol | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Thinking back to his undergraduate years, Jonathan Kozol \u201958 said he could not remember a single Harvard senior who planned to teach in the public schools. \n<br><br>\u201cTeaching was not regarded as a sufficiently dignified profession for a Harvard graduate,\u201d said Kozol, who attended the exclusive Noble and Greenough School in Dedham, Mass. While some classmates would teach at schools like his, \u201cby and large teaching was unthinkable.\u201d\n<br><br>Fifty years later, with an enormous debt to the education activist, scores of Harvard graduates-to-be compete to teach in the poorest schools in America. For the past 40 years, the movement to redress inequalities in education has been Kozol\u2019s movement, and the urgency felt by aspiring public school teachers largely originates in his compassionate indignation.\n<br><br>In books and public lectures, Kozol\u2014the former Eliot House resident\u2014assails government and society for perpetuating cycles of poverty and lackluster education. \n<br><br>At the same time, he celebrates the teachers who foster a love of learning in underprivileged students in spite of dilapidated buildings, crowded classrooms, and tattered books that hinder learning. Kozol\u2019s dedication, born in the civil rights era, still resonates with students. \n<br><br style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">BECOMING RADICAL</span>\n<br><br>As an undergraduate, Kozol said he was not directly involved in education advocacy.  \n<br><br>\u201cI was consumed with a passionate addiction to literature,\u201d he said. \n<br><br>Under the tutelage of professors Archibald MacLeish, a Pulitzer Prize-winning poet, and Harry T. Levin \u201933, a literary critic, Kozol planned a life in creative writing. \n<br><br>After graduating summa cum laude from Harvard, Kozol attended Magdalen College at Oxford, but left early for Paris. There, MacLeish introduced the young writer to the more seasoned expatriates Richard Wright and William Styron, among others. \n<br><br>From MacLeish, Levin, and the Paris group, Kozol said he developed an \u201cadmiration for people who were not only good at what they did, but also good at conveying it to younger people.\u201d They \u201cpredisposed\u201d Kozol to teaching, \u201cbut the specific event that precipitated my decision to teach\u201d was the June 1964 murder of three civil rights activists in Mississippi.\n<br><br>When he heard the news, Kozol was back in Cambridge, where he planned to enroll in graduate school at Harvard to study Elizabethan literature. \n<br><br>Disturbed by the events, he approached the pastor of a black church in Roxbury to ask how he could help. The pastor, said Kozol, told him what his community most needed was dedicated teachers. \n<br><br>\u201cWithin a month, I was teaching fourth grade in Roxbury,\u201d he said. \n<br><br>Before the end of the school year, Kozol was fired for teaching the poetry of Langston Hughes. \n<br><br>\u201cThey were determined to suppress any semblance of civil rights activities in the Boston schools\u2014they were eager to get rid of me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut like most Harvard graduates, I didn\u2019t suffer long.\u201d \n<br><br>Kozol landed a job teaching in Newton, a wealthier school district but one that also implemented a successful integrative busing program.\n<br><br>\u201cThat experience radicalized me,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t become an activist as a result of reading the right books. I just thought, \u2018My god, both these cities are in the same country, but in one school system [in Roxbury], the children are shortchanged in every possible way you can imagine.\u2019\u201d\n<br><br>Kozol translated his early teaching experiences into \u201cDeath at an Early Age: The Destruction of the Hearts and Minds of Negro Children in the Boston Public Schools,\u201d his first book of non-fiction. Its selection for the National Book Award in 1968 \u201cunfortunately propelled me into a public role, which I had never wanted,\u201d he said. \n<br><br>\u201cIt was virtually impossible to maintain the relative private experience of a teacher,\u201d he said.\n<br><br>A dozen books and two Guggenheim fellowships later, Kozol continues his advocacy for better public school systems and funding. A vocal critic of the No Child Left Behind Act, Kozol said he has spent recent months working with the staff of Senator Barack Obama on policy briefs. And last year, Kozol founded the Cambridge Institute for Public Education to prevent the drain of qualified teachers from public schools. \n<br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">TEACHING, DIGNIFIED</span>\n<br><br>As a freshman, Elizabeth G. Hornig \u201908 read Kozol\u2019s 1991 book \u201cSavage Inequalities: Children in America\u2019s Schools\u201d in a single day. \n<br><br>\u201cIt has in some ways haunted me ever since,\u201d said Hornig, who grew up outside Kansas City. \u201cIt awakened me to a set of issues that, coming from my privileged suburban background, I didn\u2019t even realize, since they are invisible issues. It was a very painful revelation.\u201d\n<br><br>When Kozol read from his newest book, \u201cLetters to a Young Teacher,\u201d to a packed Memorial Church in September, Hornig was in the crowd. After the talk, she said, she finally overcame her hesitations about teaching and applied to Teach For America (TFA), which places college graduates in two-year teaching positions in high-need school districts. (She will be teaching high school French in the Mississippi Delta region next year.)\n<br><br>Kozol\u2019s books \u201ccan\u2019t help but make you outraged,\u201d Hornig said. \n<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s a great thing to finally be able to act on all that feeling.\u201d\n<br><br>Although Kozol argues that TFA\u2019s two-year placement perpetuates the already-high turnover at public schools, he also praises the program for recruiting new teachers to low-income districts. \n<br><br>\u201cI simply hope that [they] will not see it as two years of service to provide them with idealistic cocktail conversation 20 years later when they are corporate lawyers, but will see it as the first step in their life\u2019s career,\u201d said Kozol, who also said that he has personally recruited hundreds of teachers to the program.\n<br><br>Christopher H. Green \u201908\u2014who said that Kozol has had an influence on him\u2014said he has had trouble finding a teaching job after being turned down by TFA. Public schools otherwise require teachers to be state-certified, and jobs at charter schools, many of which do not require certification, are quite competitive. \n<br><br>Green partially attributed his interest in education to Kozol\u2019s work, which he called \u201ceye-opening\u201d to the inequities in school funding, but said he may end up teaching in a private school instead, before going to graduate school in education.\n<br><br>Over 100 of Hornig and Green\u2019s classmates will likely join them in the field of education this year, according to The Crimson\u2019s most recent senior survey.\n<br><br>In the survey, more than 10 percent of respondents who plan to work next year said they will do so in education. Forty-one seniors have joined TFA this year, almost twice the 24 that joined last year.\n<br><br>Kozol lived in Roxbury for 20 years, but now resides in Byfield, Mass., where he finds the \u201cisolation\u201d necessary to write.\n<br><br>Sociology professor Mary C. Brinton includes Kozol\u2019s 2005 \u201cThe Shame of the Nation: The Restoration of Apartheid Schooling in America\u201d on her \u201cEducation and Society\u201d syllabus. \n<br><br>\u201cThere is a power to his writing that is much harder to find in traditional social science treatments of these subjects,\u201d Brinton said.\n<br><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\u2014Staff writer Jeremy S.

Lewis hopes to film the project right in Harvard Yard, though they have not yet sought the administration\u2019s approval. <br><br>According to University spokesman Joe Wrinn, on-campus shoots are the exception rather than the rule. Ordinarily, commercial projects cannot be shot on campus, though films set at Harvard often use aerial shots and footage taken from public property. <br><br>Last summer, Denzel Washington directed and starred in \u201cThe Great Debaters,\u201d which featured scenes in Sanders Theatre and with Harvard\u2019s campus in the background. <br><br>\u201cLast year, we allowed filming in Sanders Theatre as part of the \u2018Great Debaters\u2019 movie because Sanders makes its theater available for commercial recordings, but filming was not allowed on campus,\u201d Wrinn wrote in an e-mail. <br><br>And despite the fact that Harvard will likely reject Lewis\u2019 bid to film on campus, he said he\u2019s still optimistic about the movie\u2019s potential. <br><br>\u201cThere\u2019s a great tradition of zombie movies,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can join those ranks with our little movie that would be only too great.\u201d <br><br>\u201cThe Harvard Zombie Massacre\u201d is scheduled to begin shooting in early 2009. <br><br><em>\u2014Staff writer Amanda C.

But he said he would not enlist as anything other than a gay man, and so a military policy barring openly homosexual or bisexual recruits kept him away.\r<br><br>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be able to be completely honest about such an important part of who I am,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m prevented from serving my country in the most open and sincere way.\u201d\r<br><br>On May 24, Harvard students\u2014regardless of sexual orientation or desire to serve in the military\u2014will embark on a week-long coalition-sponsored trip around the east coast to protest the \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d policy. \r<br><br>The tour, entitled \u201cRight to Serve,\u201d will begin in Boston and make stops in Portland, Maine, New York City, and Washington D.C. At these cities\u2019 military recruiting centers, one openly gay or lesbian student will attempt to enlist for military service. If the student is turned away, volunteers from the group will refuse to leave the recruiting center. \r<br><br>The possibility of police arriving to press charges is not unlikely, according to Jacob P. Reitan, a Harvard Divinity School student who first conceived of the tour. Punishment for protesting an \u201cimmoral law\u201d would be a badge of honor, he said.\r<br><br>Harvard College Democrats President Jarret A. Zafran said the bill is \u201crank hypocrisy\u201d and a government sanction of discrimination. He added that the possibility of punishment did not dissuade him. \r<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s a small price to pay,\u201d said Zafran, whose group is co-sponsoring the tour. \u201cNot all laws are just laws.\u201d\r<br><br>The \u201cRight to Serve\u201d tour\u2019s method of protest is modeled after the sit-ins of the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s.\r<br><br>\u201cJim Crow and \u2018Don\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u2019 are equally morally reprehensible,\u201d Reitan said. \u201cThe manner [in which] we confront them should be the same.\u201d \r<br><br>The group hopes to encourage Republican Senator Susan M. Collins of Maine and Democratic Senator Edward M. Kennedy \u201954-\u201956 of Massachusetts\u2014who has said in the past that he needs a Republican co-sponsor\u2014into working together to repeal the policy, according to Brooks.\r<br><br>By stopping in New York City and Washington D.C., Brooks said, the tour hopes to put pressure on presidential candidates Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and John McCain, and perhaps ask for meetings with legislators.\r<br><br>The military policy first came into effect as part of the 1993 Department of Defense budget. The earliest iteration also prohibited officers from investigating enlisted men solely to discover their sexual orientation. \r<br><br>Other than Turkey, the U.S. is currently the only country in NATO that prevents gays and lesbians from serving openly\u2014despite the fact that other countries have proved the feasibility of open service, Brooks said.\r<br><br>\u201cThere\u2019s no further excuse for inaction on this issue,\u201d he added.\r<br><br>\u2014Staff Writer Esther I.

{"title": "Faust Vetoes Tenure Decision | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>With word that University President Drew G. Faust vetoed the appointment of the distinguished Berkeley economist Christina D. Romer, economics professors at Harvard and Berkeley expressed a combination of bewilderment and disappointment in interviews yesterday.\n<br><br>The economics department had voted to extend a tenure offer to Romer, while her husband, David, was slated to take a position at the Kennedy School of Government.\n<br><br>But in an interview yesterday, David H. Romer, a Berkeley macroeconomist who specializes in monetary policy, said that he would not be taking the tenured position that he was offered at the Kennedy School, and that he and his wife would remain at Berkeley. His wife, Christina, declined to comment for this story.\n<br><br>Although Christina Romer cleared the first step to tenure\u2014winning the approval from the economics department\u2014her appointment was overturned by Faust, who declined to comment for this story. <br><br>While the president has vetoed proposals from the department in the past, historically the economics department has had a strong record of having its decisions sustained, according to one Kennedy School professor contacted yesterday.\n<br><br>Given Romer\u2019s stature as an economist\u2014she serves as co-director of the monetary economics program at the National Bureau of Economics Research and as a senior advisor to Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama\u2014the decision to deny her tenure left many academics scratching their heads.\n<br><br>\u201cMany of us are outraged at the treatment of our colleagues, whom we admire enormously,\u201d said Berkeley economist J.\nBradford DeLong '82, who has also written widely in the field of economic history.\n<br><br>DeLong said that one possible explanation for why Faust overturned Romer\u2019s appointment is that some may have felt that the couple\u2019s presence on the Harvard faculty would \u201cmove the department as a whole in the wrong direction.\u201d But he emphasized that the true reason remains a mystery.\n<br><br>\u201cUnless the president has magical presidential insight powers, than either the department itself has made a mistake for putting her up, or the president has made a mistake,\u201d DeLong said. \u201cI don\u2019t even have a credible theory for what Massachusetts Hall could possibly have been thinking.\u201d\n<br><br>At Harvard, professors were less willing to talk, but many expressed disappointment in the decision. Economics department chair James H. Stock did not return requests for comment yesterday.\n<br><br>\u201cI have great admiration for Christy Romer as a teacher and scholar, and I was looking forward to having her as a colleague,\u201d economics professor N. Gregory Mankiw wrote in an e-mailed statement. \u201cI am personally disappointed that she will not be joining the Harvard faculty.\u201d\n<br><br>Mankiw added that the details of Harvard\u2019s selection process and deliberations are confidential.\n<br><br>Since receiving their Ph.D.s from MIT in 1985, the Romers\u2019 careers\nhave followed similar trajectories\u2014both became ladder faculty at\nBerkeley in 1988 and won tenure five years later.\n<br><br>They have made their careers on the west coast, but both have\nhad lingering ties to Cambridge. According to DeLong, MIT offered a position to Christina Romer but not\nher husband in the early 1990s. And under former University President\nNeil L. Rudenstine, the couple passed both the ad hoc and approval from\nMass. Hall, but ultimately chose to stay in California, Delong said.\n<br><br>According to David L. Warsh \u201966, a former economics correspondent for The Boston Globe, now would have been an ideal time for Harvard to make an offer to the Romers because two of their three children will be at MIT in the fall and each has an elderly parent in Massachusetts.\n<br><br>Additionally, Romer could have replaced retiring economic historian Jeffrey G. Williamson, Warsh wrote on his blog, \u201cEconomic Principals.\u201d\n<br><br>Though many remain disappointed with Faust\u2019s decision, at least one Berkeley professor said that he was happy that his department would be keeping the distinguished academics.\n<br><br>\u201cThe rest of the faculty at Berkeley are extremely delighted that Christina and David decided to stay,\u201d said David E.

{"title": "The Maverick in the Arena | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Sen. John McCain is in the arena, his face marred by dust, sweat and blood\u2014and that\u2019s just on the Right. Two-fifths of Republicans are voting for him this November because they can\u2019t stand the other guy, according to a recent Hotline poll. And one tenth of them are voting for the Democrat. \r\n<br><br>\u201cI was a foot soldier in the Reagan Revolution,\u201d McCain protests, brandishing his American Conservative Union lifetime rating of 83 percent, compared to eight percent for Sen. Barack Obama. Still, conservatives charge insubordination: The maverick pulls his punches with his Democratic opponents, yet pummels his Republican allies. To win the Right\u2019s trust, he must fight for it, not against it.\r\n<br><br>Courting moderates, McCain likens himself to Teddy Roosevelt, the Bull Moose who bucked both political parties. True, the maverick clips Republicans often: He called Donald Rumsfeld one of the worst defense secretaries in history, dubbed the federal response to Hurricane Katrina \u201cdisgraceful,\u201d and slammed President Bush for \u201cshirking\u201d his duty to combat climate change. \r\n<br><br>Yet McCain\u2019s wrists go limp when he\u2019s dueling Democrats. The maverick labeled Obama\u2019s plan to raise taxes \u201cout of touch.\u201d He called the Democratic frontrunner\u2019s pledge to keep troops in Iraq to attack al Qaeda, after vowing to withdraw them immediately, \u201cremarkable.\u201d And when Ahmed Yousef, a member of Hamas, effectively endorsed Obama, McCain bellowed, \u201cI think people can make judgments accordingly.\u201d\r\n<br><br>Unlike the maverick, liberals fight dirty. Distorting McCain\u2019s remarks at a town hall meeting in New Hampshire, Obama declared, \u201cJohn McCain wants to continue a war in Iraq perhaps as long as 100 years,\u201d which the non-partisan watchdog, Factcheck.org, says is a \u201crank falsehood.\u201d Taking a cheap shot at his opponent\u2019s age, the Illinois Democrat recently accused McCain of \u201closing his bearings.\u201d And it\u2019s only May.\r\n<br><br>The muckrakers\u2014McCain\u2019s supposed pals\u2014aren\u2019t jumping to his defense; they\u2019re adding to the body pile. In February, The New York Times, which endorsed him over his more conservative rivals in the primary, published a story suggesting he had a tryst with a female lobbyist. His response? He was \u201cdisappointed\u201d in the paper. To quote Bob Dole, where\u2019s the outrage?\r\n<br><br>Conservatives don\u2019t just feel underappreciated; they worry the maverick\u2019s unrequited love has pushed him leftward. In March, McCain was hands-off the housing market, asserting, \u201c[I]t is not the duty of government to bail out and reward those who act irresponsibly, whether they are big banks or small borrowers.\u201d Two weeks later, he was hands-on, insisting, \u201cWe will combine the power of government and the private sector to find immediate solutions for deserving American homeowners.\u201d \r\n<br><br>And last week, McCain announced he would bring most of the troops in Iraq home by 2013. During the Florida primary, however, he chided Gov. Mitt Romney for saying the President and his generals should have private \u201ctimetables\u201d to measure progress. Romney didn\u2019t offer a public date for withdrawal, yet McCain accused him of wanting to \u201cwave the white flag.\u201d So what\u2019s he doing? \r\n<br><br>McCain should stop trumpeting the issues on which he leans leftward, because liberals are still going to vote for the Democrat. Why pick Teddy when you can have Franklin? Instead, McCain should persuade voters that his deal is squarer than his opponent\u2019s. His rhetoric needn\u2019t be ugly, only firm. He also should remind conservatives why he\u2019s worth the vote\u2014he\u2019ll need every one of them in November.\r\n<br><br>I know McCain stands for victory in Iraq, smaller, better government, and traditional values. But I want him to fight vigorously for those beliefs in the arena. For now, I\u2019m sitting on the sidelines, shouting my two words of advice to the maverick for the fall: Aim left.\r\n<br><br>\n<br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Brian J.

{"title": "Straight Talk Express? | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>When the United States struggled to respond to Hurricane Katrina and the disastrous flooding of New Orleans in August 2005, John McCain backed the Bush administration\u2019s actions. He urged people to avoid \u201cpremature judgments\u201d in that chaotic time. Now, struggling to remain in the public eye as presidential politics swirl around Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, McCain has conveniently condemned President Bush\u2019s handling of Katrina, contradicting his campaign message of \u201cstraight talk.\u201d\n<br><br>Campaigning as a candidate unafraid to speak the truth, with a campaign bus called the \u201cStraight Talk Express,\u201d McCain has appeared several times on television, including Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cThe Daily Show with Jon Stewart,\u201d to stress his honesty and dedication to sticking to his principles. In criticizing Bush about Katrina, however, McCain has recently shifted away from this straight talk, embracing the endorsement from his former enemy, Bush, last month. McCain seemed willing to forget the bitter and personal struggle he lost to Bush for the Republican nomination in 2000, saying, \u201cI hope that he will campaign for me as much as is in keeping with his busy schedule.\u201d  While this remark does not show any false fondness from McCain towards Bush, it still reflects a tacit acceptance of Bush\u2019s support, a surprising action from such a \u201cstraight talker.\u201d In his efforts to gain the presidency, McCain has thus been conscious of the support some Republican voters still give to the president; he has been unwilling to distance himself completely by rejecting Bush\u2019s endorsement on principle. Instead, he thanked the president, saying, \u201cI appreciate his service to our country.\u201d \n<br><br>Speaking at Xavier University in New Orleans last week, McCain blasted the local, state, and federal governments for their response to Katrina. The senator who had warned about \u201cpremature judgments\u201d  apparently decided that less than three years is enough time to emphatically pass judgment. McCain claimed at Xavier, \u201cWe know we didn\u2019t have the right kind of leadership\u201d and went on to criticize President Bush\u2019s personal actions following the disaster. Whereas in his role as a senior senator McCain had been reconciliatory and slow to attack other politicians, as a presidential candidate the rules seem to have changed. McCain now seems to believe that his straight talk refers more to the conviction of what he says at one time than to the consistency of his remarks. When in Washington, D.C., he can speak against only some Bush administration actions; when in New Orleans, he can openly attack Bush himself for a delayed response to Katrina.\n<br><br>It is true that McCain has assailed some actions taken by the Bush administration in responding to Katrina since August 2005. For example, in a May 2007 speech he compared FEMA\u2019s inefficient Katrina response to the precision of private shipping firms like UPS and FedEx. He said, \u201cU.P.S., FedEx and Wal-Mart can tell in real time where a package is anywhere in the world, but FEMA, despite its multibillion-dollar budget, couldn\u2019t track many of its assets during its Katrina response\u2026\u201d Similarly, when Congress gathered to assess the costs of Katrina in October 2005, McCain was quick to cut budget spending to accommodate the billions of dollars required for emergency relief efforts.  He was constructive and supportive of the Bush administration, but notably did not attempt to raise more funds at the time. Both instances show that while McCain has not openly criticized President Bush as a leader until now, he has also not fully supported the Bush administration response to Katrina.\n<br><br>Part of McCain\u2019s appeal in 2000, and again in 2008, has been his frank, independent nature. McCain has built up a respected and honest career doing what he thinks is right and not worrying about how his actions might upset party leaders and the political hierarchy in Washington. McCain has come too far to abandon these character traits for a few more votes in the presidential campaign. Attacking Bush about Katrina might appeal to embittered or neglected citizens and students in New Orleans, but it is not worth sacrificing integrity.\n<br><br>McCain\u2019s task of keeping Republican core voters and party leaders satisfied while attempting to appeal to more moderate or independent voters requires a difficult juggling act. He needs to be more aware of the potential consequences of any step taken in either direction. His remarks against Bush at Xavier would have been consistent with his platform if he had not dutifully accepted Bush\u2019s support and praised him a month earlier. Perhaps some Republican voters would have been similarly offended if McCain had more openly deflected Bush\u2019s support.\n<br><br>By accepting Bush\u2019s endorsement, McCain made a choice to stand together with the Bush administration. Attacking it now might seem like an easy way to stir up votes among those dissatisfied with Bush\u2019s response post-Katrina, especially from those whose lives are still defined by the Katrina disaster. Yet just as McCain once called for circumspection in evaluating the government\u2019s role in the aftermath of Katrina, he should call for circumspection again, this time from himself. Taking a step back from the campaign trail, McCain should recognize that his integrity and straight-talking reputation is worth more than a few cheap votes.\n<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Alexander R.

{"title": "Idiots on the Charles | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>My favorite nickname for Harvard has always been \u201cThe Kremlin on the Charles.\u201d There is something subversive in the name that touches the inner rebel in me\u2014the idea that my school, however idealized by U.S. News &amp; World Reports and The New York Times, is considered by some (or many) Americans to be a bastion of elitist, pinko revolutionaries. \n<br><br>Elitism and Communism have been hot topics on the campaign trail recently because of Barack Obama\u2019s infamous \u201cbitter\u201d comments. William Kristol \u201973, a sometimes Harvard lecturer and a new addition to the Times\u2019 opinion page, made the connection explicit in a column titled, \u201cThe Mask Slips.\u201d  With McCarthyite overtones everywhere, Kristol compares Obama to Marx, quotes a little German, and makes sure to reference San Francisco. The message, though cloaked in academic language, is clear: the real Obama is a German Commie, who showed his true self when surrounded by freaky West Coast liberals.  \n<br><br>Many people have defended Obama better than I can here, so I\u2019ll be brief: What Obama was (maybe) getting at in his comments was what Marx called the idiocy of rural life\u2014a much abused phrase, one that conservatives such as Kristol love to cite. \n<br><br>\u201cIdiocy\u201d or \u201cidiots\u201d for Marx are not defined simply by levels of intelligence. They are descriptive terms that refer to the apolitical nature of rural people. Industrialization excited Marx because he believed that capitalism could be overthrown only through a consolidation of people in cities; then the masses could achieve political power, instead of remaining isolated in their previously family-centric, \u201cprivate\u201d lives. \n<br><br>Whether people in rural Pennsylvania are \u201capolitical\u201d or not, whether they foolishly vote against their economic interests or not, are huge issues that Obama and the nation should confront. But what interests me more about Marx\u2019s conception of idiocy is its applicability to life here at Harvard: Maybe \u201cIdiots on the Charles\u201d is a better nickname for 21st century Cambridge than \u201cKremlin.\u201d\n<br><br>An obvious question is: Who cares? Isn\u2019t college supposed to be \u201cprivate\u201d time for students, when Wu-Tang and Coors Light are supposed to be at the top of our priority list? Or, the student-scholars on campus might respond, shouldn\u2019t I work a little harder, alone in the stacks of Widener, rather than teach in Mission Hill\u2014isn\u2019t that what Harvard is for?\n<br><br>Such questions obviously apply to any student, but I think that they may be most important for those students on campus who see themselves as \u201cpublic\u201d figures; who view their work as different from the \u201cprivate\u201d lives that \u201cCOLEGE\u201d is traditionally characterized as; who hope to create a culture of commitment on campus toward service.\n<br><br>After college, only a small portion of Harvard grads continue the service or political work of their time at school\u2014most head to some sector of the business world, while others head to law, medical, or other graduate schools. Maybe they will send some money to help AIDS in Africa or make a phone call for Darfur, but will they care about their neighborhood meetings? Will they think about who is making and enforcing the possibly discriminatory laws in their towns and cities, or who sets up budgets for inner-city versus suburban public schools? \n<br><br>What concerns me is the lack of care at Harvard for politics in our backyard\u2014the politics of everyday life that defines engaged citizens. This type of work lacks the sexiness of \u201csaving the world\u201d ideals, yet is arguably just as important in developing a sense of participation in public life and ending the disengaged apathy that Obama may have been referring to. \n<br><br>The issues that students have the most power to affect are the ones that are most often overlooked: college governance, undergraduate education, expansion into Allston, staff workers\u2019 pay and treatment, etc. There seems to be an inverse relation between the closeness to which an issue hits students and their commitment to specific issues. \n<br><br>My fear is that the far-reaching nature of undergraduates\u2019 political and service work sets up a debilitating separation between those who act and those who do not. Although people make fun of all the little things that House environmental representatives ask of us, they may be doing the most tangible and influential work in making students more socially conscious for the post-Harvard world. \n<br><br>Too often service is separated from everyday life, so that a person has to go to Texas on Alternative Spring Break or be concerned with Darfur to do \u201cgood.\u201d That is not to say that going to Texas or Darfur is not good, but only that the idea of service on campus may be too restrictive\u2014that we have given up on affecting major change to the issues that immediately surround us. \n<br><br>If academia teaches us anything, it is that we learn best from specificity: Practicing civic engagement on a local, tangible level at Harvard and in Cambridge might make us much better citizens once we leave the so-called \u201cHarvard Bubble.\u201d If not, the valuable work that students do here might just be a phase, another extracurricular that alumni look back on with nostalgia, which they can no longer fit into the busy schedules of their private lives. \n<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Andrew D.

{"title": "The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The office on Arrow Street looks more like a trendy loft apartment than the headquarters of what is rapidly becoming one of the most influential Web sites in America. The open space, once an architecture studio, is buzzing with activity. The sound of phone calls and typing fills the air, and the staff\u2014composed mostly of 20- or 30-somethings in casual office garb\u2014is busy at work. <br><br>But the company isn\u2019t just another bunch of hackers programming without a purpose. And their \u201cproduct\u201d is neither a commodity nor a service\u2014it\u2019s democracy. <br><br>Welcome to ActBlue, what its founders, Benjamin A. Rahn \u201999 and Matt S. DeBergalis, call \u201cthe online clearinghouse for Democratic action.\u201d In just a few years, the site has channelled tens of millions of dollars into Democratic campaign coffers nationwide, becoming the financial backbone of the \u201cNetroots\u201d movement that has sprouted up following the presidential campaign of former Vermont Governor Howard Dean. <br><br>While much has been written about the blogs and other media that form the core of the online progressive movement, ActBlue is adding the muscle that proves that vocal bloggers are more than just a bunch of kids ranting on the Web. While harnessing the energy of the Netroots, ActBlue is trading in the currency of old-school politics: cash, and lots of it. <br><br>But as equal parts technology whizzes and Democratic money men, Rahn and DeBergalis want to do more than revolutionize how politics is financed. Indeed, they see themselves as part of a broader force, one that seeks to democratize politics as it Democratizes America. <br><br><strong>THE REVENGE OF THE NERDS <br></strong><br>Before their site launched in the months before the 2004 presidential election, ActBlue\u2019s founders lived lives divorced from politics. <br><br>In fact, Rahn and DeBergalis didn\u2019t meet at a political rally or a campaign event, but at \u201cgeek camp\u201d when they attended the Research Summer Institute (RSI) at MIT in the summer before their senior years of high school. The year was 1994, a full decade before they founded ActBlue. <br><br>Rahn attended the prestigious Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Alexandria, Va., while DeBergalis grew up in Indiana and attended high school in San Juan, P.R. As an undergraduate, Rahn lived in Quincy House and joint-concentrated in math and physics, while DeBergalis studied computer science at MIT. (During his time there, he became good friends with Kathy Paur, a math whiz in her own right who would eventually marry Rahn.) <br><br>While he was not directly involved in politics during his time at the College, Rahn did help push through reforms allowing departmental courses to be approved for Core credit, saying that he has \u201calways had the sense or inclination towards trying to change things at a systemic or political level.\u201d <br><br>But his passion for grassroots change remained distinct from his academic career: after graduating, Rahn enrolled at the California Institute of Technology to pursue a doctorate in theoretical physics. DeBergalis stayed on for an extra year at what he calls his \u201creally good trade school,\u201d earning a master\u2019s degrees in computer science before starting his career at Cambridge-based technology companies. <br><br style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold\"><span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold\">CHANGING LANES<br><br></span>But shortly after graduating from MIT, DeBergalis found his interest in his work waning. \u201cSo much of it is so divorced from anything in particular,\u201d he says of his time writing code and running scripts. \u201cI could never explain to my mom what I did or why she couldn\u2019t buy what I wrote.\u201d<br><br>DeBergalis found a more hands-on pursuit when he decided to run for the Cambridge City Council in 2003. Though at 26 he was the youngest candidate in the race and had virtually no experience in politics, DeBergalis\u2014who was better known to Cambridge voters as \u201cDeBerg\u201d\u2014turned his age into an advantage by intensively courting the youth vote. His platform spoke directly to college students and recent graduates, focusing on issues such as increased late night transportation and extended restaurant hours. <br><br>By making numerous trips to Harvard Houses and the Yard in hopes of creating\u2014and then winning\u2014a demographic of student voters, DeBergalis successfully registered 800 students from Harvard and MIT.<br><br>But in the end, DeBergalis would come up short, even as he won more \u201cfirst-place votes\u201d than one of the candidates who was ultimately elected. Cambridge\u2019s distinctive method of voting did him in because after the \u201ctransfer votes\u201d were counted, DeBergalis had dropped\u00a0 from ninth to tenth place, and out of a council seat\u2014a result of the fact that he had little of a following outside of the two elite universities. <br><br>Even as he came up short, DeBergalis made his mark on the local political scene: his loss ignited a debate over Cambridge\u2019s electoral system, which some criticized for favoring incumbents. His fresh campaign style also brought new attention to the oft-ignored college student demographic. Glenn S. Koocher \u201971, a veteran political analyst who was once a Crimson writer, said during the subsequent election that he didn\u2019t \u201csee anyone out there running that kind of a grassroots campaign, mobilizing voters as DeBergalis had done.\u201d<br><br>DeBergalis, for his part, didn\u2019t let the loss dampen his enthusiasm for shaking up the political scene. After the results were released on election day in 2003, DeBergalis wrote to his supporters in his LiveJournal: \u201cYou threw out the old political equation in Cambridge, and we all get to decide what to replace it with.\u201d <br><br>In 2005, DeBergalis would endorse reformist candidates for city council; and though he had left the local political scene by 2007, he hadn\u2019t lost his interest, showing up at the Cambridge Senior Center on election night to watch the counting of the votes, and expressing support for urban planner Sam Seidel when he won a seat on the council. <br><br><span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold\">STARTING BIG<br><br></span>For DeBergalis and Rahn, changing Cambridge\u2019s political equation was only the beginning. Shortly after the election, Rahn left his doctoral program at Caltech and joined forces with his old friend to bring reformist progressivism to a larger audience. The two created ActBlue, a venture that represents a cutting-edge\u2014and most importantly, democratic\u2014approach to politics and fundraising.<br><br>The most basic function of ActBlue is enabling people to donate money to their favorite candidates online, and in small increments. Students and others who can only afford to make small donations can do so with the click of a mouse, allowing them to become active in the political sphere that they would otherwise have difficulty accessing.<br><br>And beyond serving as an outsourcing company that processes political donations for technologically ill-equipped campaigns, ActBlue allows individuals to create their own personal \u201cfundraising pages\u201d to raise funds for a slate of favored candidates. Through these pages, ActBlue users can network and organize events to spread their cause. What the technology system Scoop did for liberal blogs\u2014turning them into online communities by allowing individuals to create personalized pages\u2014ActBlue soon did for the world of online fundraising. <br><br>\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that online fundraising has changed the composition of contributors,\u201d says government professor Sunshine Hillygus. \u201cIt makes it easier for the political junkies to take their political engagement up to the next level and make a contribution.\u201d Hillygus add that the Web site allows people to donate to candidates who will use donations more effectively, allowing donors to get more \u201cbang for their buck.\u201d<br><br></span></p> <p><span><embed height=\"355\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/IZUwl40vBsU&amp;hl=en\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"425\" wmode=\"transparent\"></embed><br><br></span></p> <p><span>While 2008 has been the year of the small donor\u2014Democratic frontrunner Barack Obama has financially swamped Hillary Clinton largely due to the fact that he can return to his army of donors\u00a0 who give gifts of under $50\u2014the cost of processing such micro-donations is often prohibitive for smaller-scale campaigns, given the high processing fees for credit card payments. <br><br>ActBlue gets around this obstacle by bundling small donations made through the site and writing one check to the campaign. People can donate to virtually any Democratic candidate, no matter if they\u2019re running for president, Senate, House, or governor or state legislature in one of the 25 states without state restrictions on campaign finance. <br><br>With billions of dollars flowing through the political system each year, many Americans subscribe to a cynical, dressed-down version of Max Weber\u2019s fear of plutocracy: since politicians turn to the well-heeled to finance elections, they are likely to care little about the interests of the masses. <br><br>In the 2006 midterm elections, for example, successful candidates for the House of Representatives raised an average of $1.3 million, while candidates elected to the Senate raised just under $9 million. With a projected price-tag of well over $1 billion for the 2008 presidential election, many wonder whether there is just too much money floating around in politics. <br><br>But to Rahn and DeBergalis, the answer is a clear \u201cno.\u201d <br><br>DeBergalis can recite a list of statistics\u2014the annual American ice cream market is $12 billion, and the annual video game market is $20 billion, for example\u2014that make the amount spent on elections look like pocket change. \u201cWe are competing, and losing badly, in my opinion, for the attention of people compared to all the other things that can occupy your time and money, ranging from entertainment to goods that you like to buy,\u201d he says. <br><br>Rather than reduce the amount of money in politics, the pair would rather flood it with so much money from small donors that the effect of a comparatively small number of fat cats is minimized. One hundred dollars here and there may not seem like much given the astronomically increasing costs of financing campaigns, but that $100 multiplied by, say, 1,000 people can quickly make its mark. <br><br>And their emphasis on small donations\u2014based on the innovative personalized approach\u2014is working. Though it launched in 2004 with only $30,000 of \u201cseed money,\u201d the site has grown so popular that it raised $800,000 for Democratic candidates in a single day on March 31. By the end of this election cycle, ActBlue says that it will have channelled $100 million to Democratic candidates. <br><br>One of its most resounding success stories was the 2007 elections for the Virginia state senate. After going through the organization\u2019s training program on how to tap into established online fundraising networks, Virginia Democrats raised over $600,000 through ActBlue. <br><br>In the election, the Democrats ended up overturning a longstanding Republican majority, and now control the chamber by the slimmest of margins. <br><br><strong>OLD FRIENDS <br></strong><br>Rahn and DeBergalis emphasize that their work is not all about money, but that fundraising just happens to be one of the more effective ways to help people advance their political beliefs. To this end, ActBlue is planning to allow campaigns to see not only how much money a donor has contributed, but how many hours he or she has volunteered\u2014knocking on doors, making phone calls, or putting up posters. <br><br>The duo\u2019s emphasis on all forms of politics rather than just finances is reflected in ActBlue\u2019s home base: it\u2019s not in the nation\u2019s capital, but near thousands of the sorts of young, idealistic college students that they hope to inspire. <br><br>Rahn\u2019s role as a tutor in Pforzheimer House ties him even more tightly to the College community, so much so that he chose PfoHo as the location of his wedding to Paur in September 2005. (The couple\u2019s online wedding registry, www.benandkathy.com, looks like an iteration of the ActBlue platform\u2014guests can donate online to various gifts such as \u201cKathy\u2019s fancy-shmancy ice-cream maker\u201d or their not-yet-conceived children\u2019s educations: \u201cWe think it\u2019s never too early to not count on winning Intel/Westinghouse...,\u201d they write, in classic nerd form.) <br><br>John M. Sheffield \u201909, who has lived on Rahn\u2019s and Paur\u2019s floor for the past two years, attests to his tutors\u2019 presence in House life. This past Super Tuesday, for example, Rahn created a Web site to update students on the results of the race. And that\u2019s not the extent of Rahn\u2019s supposed abilities: Sheffield says that \u201cone time he wrestled three or four bears to death in Pasadena, California,\u201d though, truth be told, neither the bespectacled Rahn\u2014who usually dons Steve-Jobsish black turtlenecks\u2014nor the more laid-back, hoodie-clad DeBergalis looks like he can take a bear, let alone three or four. <br><br><strong>RED AND BLUE STATES </strong><br><br>Of course, Rahn and DeBergalis don\u2019t really care about taking on bears: the only animal they aim to do battle with is the Republican elephant. <br><br>Using the Internet as a tool in political organizing has served the Democratic Party well, allowing it to surpass the Republicans in fundraising for the first time in recent history and giving candidates sophisticated tools with which to build grassroots organizations. While Republicans have tried to copy the online organizing model, they haven\u2019t been nearly as successful. In fact, Obama has used his Web-driven fundraising apparatus to bring in more campaign funds than all of the candidates for the Republican nomination combined. <br><br>The ActBlue guys, of course, have a perfectly deprecating explanation for why the Democrats have thus far outclassed the Republicans. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that the Republican Party would find this technique as valuable,\u201d DeBergalis says. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that they want to empower people in quite the same way.\u201d Not that DeBergalis is complacent: he says that Democrats \u201chave to keep investing in this type of innovation, or Republicans will catch up and find a way to use the Internet for their own nefarious ends.\u201d <br><br>Within the party, ActBlue\u2019s central aim is not to help big-name candidates like the presidential contenders, it\u2019s about getting the word out for the lesser-known Democrats with strong, innovative ideas. Much of the $43 million has gone to the campaigns of people such as Daniel K. Biss \u201998, who is running for state representative from Chicago\u2019s affluent and liberal north suburbs. <br><br>Biss, an old friend of Rahn and DeBergalis from RSI, is a professor of mathematics at the University of Chicago. On his thirtieth birthday, his wife, Karin Steinbrueck, a graduate student at Northwestern, started her own ActBlue page and asked supporters to donate $30 each to her husband's campaign. It worked. She raised $1,582 on her page alone, and contributed to Biss\u2019 ActBlue fundraising total of over $70,000\u2014an incredible online haul for what is an otherwise obscure race. <br><br>And the staff of ActBlue doesn\u2019t assume that everyone is well-acquainted with such fundraising methods\u2014or the elements of running a political campaign. DeBergalis says that one of the \u201cmost valuable\u201d things the group does is provide someone \u201con the phone who understands how elections work.\u201d <br><br>\u201cBen and Matt implemented ActBlue in a way that incorporates all those layers of idealistic thinking with incredibly solid engineering and amazing political staff who go out and teach people to use ActBlue,\u201d Paur says. <br><br><strong>ROCK THE VOTE </strong><br><br>The strength of ActBlue, the pair insists, lies not only in its superior technology or its ability to raise gobs of cash, but in the fact that the site serves to translate into action what they think is a latent desire for a better country. <br><br>Though Rahn recalls that DeBergalis was told he looked like a \u201ckernel hacker\u201d at a career fair, DeBergalis notes that his computer training wasn\u2019t a waste of time. \u201cThe specifics of what you\u2019re studying are just not remotely comparable to who you work with, how you learn to think, how you learn to work hard, and all those other things,\u201d he says. <br><br>The Internet, the great equalizer, has empowered people to act\u2014be it by donating money, time, or even running for office. Rahn and DeBergalis have emphasized this message particularly at schools like Harvard and MIT, where students are equipped with the resources and education to effect change. <br><br>\u201cNo one should tolerate the world as it is,\u201d Rahn says in summing up the ActBlue philosophy, not \u201cif they can make it better.\u201d <br><br><em>\u2014Staff writer Jun Li can be reached junli@fas.harvard.edu. <br></em><br></span></p>"}
{"title": "If It Ain\u2019t Broke... | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Everybody seems to believe it: The way the two parties nominate presidential candidates is a troubled system that needs \u201creform.\u201d<br><br>National political leaders and journalists gather today at Harvard\u2019s Institute of Politics for a day-long conference to mull ideas for making those adjustments. Yet a fair question also needs to be asked: If it ain\u2019t broke, why fix it? Rather than sweeping \u201creforms,\u201d a more do-able proposition is a series of tweaks and adjustments to the current processes.<br><br>We have to begin by asking ourselves: Does the current system \u201cwork?\u201d  Despite the quadrennial complaint that the current nominating process is too long, too expensive and too negative, the 2008 presidential campaign is producing credible nominees who will offer American voters clear distinctions.<br><br>Unlike recent elections, the choice between John McCain and Hillary Clinton or John McCain and Barack Obama will not leave voters feeling  they have to choose between the lesser of two evils.  These match-ups provide Americans with clear choices on the war in Iraq, health care, cures for the economy and judicial appointments.<br><br>On the Republican side, the nominating process produced McCain, the strongest general election candidate in the field of GOP contenders, according to the polls.<br><br>On the Democratic side, the spirited battle between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama is generating record turnouts of new Democratic voters, with huge increases especially in the female, African-American, and young adult demographics. Those new registrants will prove useful to the eventual nominee and to other Democratic candidates down the ballot come November.<br><br>The purpose of the nominating process is producing electable candidates, not fostering debate or civic participation. That\u2019s an important nuance to remember in this discussion.<br><br>Some criticisms of the process are inconsistent. Early criticisms that states like Iowa and New Hampshire had too much influence because winners there quickly rolled up the nominations has given way to criticism that the process is now too long.<br><br>So which is it: Is the process too long or not long enough?  When coming to a decision, bear in mind that more Democrats than ever are having a \u201csay\u201d in the 2008 contest.<br><br>Yes, you can make a case the protracted battle is hurting both Clinton and Obama\u2019s chances in the fall election.  Their attacks on one another amount to doing McCain\u2019s dirty work for him.<br><br>But that battle will soon be over and such divisions will heal quickly for<br><br>most Democrats. While the folks on the losing side will be sore, most will quickly rally to the nominee.  They\u2019ll get over it and for good reason.  If Hillary Clinton loses, her supporters will be bitter but will wind up for Obama because whatever differences exist between Hillary and Barack, they are nothing compared with the differences between a Republican and a Democrat in 2008. <br><br>On the Democratic side, the current nominating system contains within it the very mechanism to bring about a quick conclusion:  superdelegates. While upsetting to some, these elected officials and party leaders form a system of \u201cpeer review\u201d among those for whom politics is a profession, and it is now incumbent upon them to make the final decision: which candidate will be the strongest one to throw against McCain? Ironically, there is almost no complaint about the Republican process and its \u201cwinner take all\u201d primary system.  That system produces the same results Democratic superdelegates will ultimately provide: a conclusion and a nominee.<br><br>Yet, while there shouldn\u2019t be a major overhaul to the way the system works now, here are some questions both parties ought to be asking themselves about how primaries and caucuses are administered. <br><br>Should caucuses and primaries be open to independent and cross-over voters, or just to registered members of the party?  Currently, different states have different rules governing this question. You can argue it either way, but it\u2019s legitimate for each party to consider one national standard so that all states and election participants are treated the same way.<br><br>Should states that hold caucuses be required to adopt a uniform set of rules for running those events?  The large turnouts at the caucuses change the nature of those once-intimate events. Adjustments to be considered include ending same day registrations a week earlier rather than allow people to register at the caucus site.  Overworked volunteers have been swamped by large turnouts.<br><br>Requiring voters to get registered at least a week earlier would mean caucus leaders can have one less thing to do at the caucus. It would also provide them a list showing who is eligible to participate, reducing the possibility of fraud.  Also, the parties need to consider uniform caucus tabulation systems and appeals and criminal penalties for falsifying caucus results, just as it is a crime to falsify primary election results.<br><br>And states and parties should consider putting caucuses under the control of local election officials, just as voting is on primary day,which would assure that the process is impartial and consistent.<br><br>Another change caucus states could adopt is one Maine allows: Voters who can\u2019t get to the caucus can cast an absentee ballot at a caucus to register their initial preference. That\u2019s an easy way to meet the valid criticism that caucuses disenfranchise people who can\u2019t attend.<br><br>Caucuses could also be held on Saturday nights instead of week nights, or alternatively voting could be allowed during a longer window of time to enable greater participation.<br><br>But big changes to the nominating processes rarely win approval.  They are fine for rules freaks and debating societies to discuss but the fact remains that, in politics, most change is evolutionary, not revolutionary.<br><br><br><br>David Yepsen is the political columnist for the Des Moines Register and is a fellow this spring at the Institute of Politics.</span></p>"}

They\u2019ve now been given several manufactured, make-or-break Tuesdays, and yet the primary churns on.  Now things better turn more exciting, or we\u2019ll switch to the ballgame.<br><br>This ennui must stem from the penny-ante poker that the major news outlets have been playing for months on end. If this race is as revolutionary and unpredictable as we keep being told it is, why leave its coverage to the lumpy, petit-bourgeois benchwarmers puttering around this or that Washington bureau? Only the master conjurers holed up in Hollywood studios and Manhattan high-rises, arbiters and alchemists of the American Zeitgeist, can save the ailing electoral beast.<br><br>The problem is, there\u2019s little left to be resolved. We\u2019ve heard for weeks of the \u2018mathematical impossibility\u2019 associated with a Clinton victory, yet MSNBC keeps plugging away with dozens of hours of \u201cDecision \u201908\u201d coverage. Can you hear Middle America yawning, too? The stakes need (re-)raising, and this hackneyed political narrative could do with a bit of novelty.<br><br>For example, take the cover of the May 5 issue of Time that features half of Sen. Clinton\u2019s face, half of Sen. Obama\u2019s, and the phrase, \u201cThere can only be one.\u201d Despite being a nervy rip-off of both recent advertisements for the NBA playoffs and the 1986 film \u201cHighlander,\u201d the cover fails to advance the primary\u2019s plot: We always knew there would only be one. That was why we were having the election. <br><br>If things are truly to remain unresolved until the Democratic convention in August, the whole script needs a rewrite. If we\u2019ve learned anything from films like \u201cMr. and Mrs. Smith\u201d and \u201cBallistic: Ecks vs. Sever,\u201d it\u2019s that audiences will watch any male-female relationship unfold as long as it features an attractive, charismatic couple, once turned against itself with explosions-qua-flirtation, uniting in the end to defeat an apocalyptic common enemy. Even if the Clinton/Obama \u2018dream ticket\u2019 is nothing more than a pundit\u2019s daydream, it might seem far more reasonable if the Chinese introduced lethal nanorobots into American bloodstreams\u2014just a thought.<br><br>This is not to impugn the news media and their repeated attempts to douse the candidates\u2019 in newer and more dramatic paint. Radio host Tammy Bruce kicked off a great development on Fox News earlier this month when she \u201cdiagnosed\u201d Clinton with mythomania, what she calls \u201c[making] up fantastic stories to bolster [one\u2019s] image.\u201d Whether or not this is medically sound or accurate (it\u2019s not), people love the psychopathology angle: what if it turned out the Tuzla incident was actually a psychotic episode, and that Sen. Clinton is in fact schizophrenic economist John Nash? Is that played out?<br><br>Meanwhile, ABC News has been vehemently derided for its recent debate, which was labeled \u2018irrelevant\u2019 by many and whose host, Charlie Gibson, was pilloried as a gossipmonger. One exemplary moment featured Nash McCabe, a Pennsylvania everywoman in a bizarre tunic who asked Sen. Obama if he \u201cbelieves in the American flag.\u201d If so, why won\u2019t he wear a tiny tin replica of it on his lapel? But the attention this debate received should point the way going forward: why not have \u201cThe Hills\u201d star Lauren Conrad ask the same thing at the next debate? It\u2019s just that folks particularly like hateful sniping and character judgments made on the basis of fashion when they\u2019re delivered by someone pretty.<br><br>Indeed, the candidates\u2014all of whom have now appeared on countless talk shows and World Wrestling Entertainment\u2019s \u201cRaw\u201d\u2014could learn something about exposure and appeal from their disgraced predecessor. He turned up on a giant screen during the game show \u201cDeal or No Deal\u201d last week. To its host, Howie Mandel, President Bush cracked: \u201cHow\u2019d you like to host a three-trillion dollar Deal or No Deal?\u201d Yes, he was talking about the budget, and he had some great material on waterboarding they cut for time. <br><br>But Democrats who find their once-electric primary narrative gone lifeless, wooden and bland should hardly despair, even if it doesn\u2019t get the Hollywood makeover it may need. John Sidney McCain is 71 years old, and there\u2019s nothing you can do about that.<br><br><br><br>James M.

In \u201cPolitical Progress and the Development of Black Insurgency,\u201d Douglas McAdam affirms descriptive representation is valuable in its contribution to the cognitive liberation\u2014what Americans consider to be legitimate and acceptable within society\u2019s institutions\u2014of American society as a whole. A black man or a woman of any color, in the highest office, may help reform the way current and future Americans conceive of those who hold power, and it may also affect many Americans\u2019 unconscious assumptions that the reason why an African-American or a woman has never been elected to the highest office is because they lack the necessary skills and mental capability to handle such responsibility. \r\n<br><br>Bolduc makes a particularly egregious generalization in denying a relationship between political and economic success. As McAdam traces, black migration out of the South following the collapse of cotton tenancy placed large numbers of African-Americans in several northern states considered critical to winning presidential elections. As political elites began to recognize African-Americans\u2019 growing reputation as a politically mobile and cohesive block of voters, Truman implemented the Fair Employment Commission in 1948. This helped raise the standard of living of African-Americans by challenging discrimination in the workplace. \r\n<br><br>In the record numbers that Obama has turned out the black vote in democratic primaries\u2014most notably in South Carolina in which blacks represented 55 percent of voters but only 30 percent of the population\u2014the reality of median voter politics dictates that the pronounced level of interest blacks are taking in politics will have an effect on their economic outcomes and government\u2019s attention to black issues. \r\n<br><br>Nevertheless, perhaps the most insulting section of Bolduc\u2019s article was when he compared African-Americans to Japanese-Americans, implying that blacks have not achieved the same level of success because, well, they\u2019re lazy. The experiences and obstacles faced by each minority group have varied significantly and influenced each people differently. Unlike any other minority group in the states, black Americans endured 300 years of slavery. The early 1900s were highlighted by the highest number of lynchings and murders of blacks in America\u2019s history. Even after the civil rights era, police brutality in the inner cities instigated city-wide race riots. \r\n<br><br>What Bolduc might not know is that the apparent respect other citizens and the government show a minority group impacts the respect they hold for themselves concerning their worth and ability. Danielle Allen elaborates in her book \u201cTalking to Strangers,\u201d explaining that when a group is forced to constantly compromise not simply their civil and natural rights, but their dignity as well, a deep-rooted sense of distrust and hopelessness develops within the group, ultimately leading many to withdraw socially and politically from society.\r\n<br><br>Considerations of race and gender require politicians to approach social issues more generously, acknowledging that former public policy has placed many groups at great disadvantage. \r\n<br><br>\n<br><br>ERIN A.

{"title": "Right, Where You Least Expect It | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Last week, the California Supreme Court voted 4-3 to recognize same-sex marriage. The decision makes the state the second in the country after Massachusetts to allow the practice. The Court justified its ruling by the constitutional right to marry and the right to equal protection.\n<br><br>The debate over same-sex marriage, like the one that rages over abortion, is a testament to the judicial branch\u2019s ability to shape societal institutions. As commentators have frequently noted, both sides have embraced the power of the court as a last resort in their struggles for desired outcomes\u2014advocates of gay marriage hope courts will uphold their rights to the practice, while opponents hope courts will agree it is unconstitutional. But in all likelihood, last week\u2019s decision in California will be overturned at the ballot box come fall, since the prevailing sentiments among voters is still one of opposition to the practice. A recent Gallup Poll found that 56 percent of Americans oppose legalizing gay marriage, a statistic that has stayed fairly constant for the last several years. For proponents of same-sex marriage, the debate has become so wrapped up in the question of whether or not same-sex marriage can be justified by the Constitution that most engaged in it have ceased to consider how to make decisions like last week\u2019s permanent.\n<br><br>If advocates of gay marriage want it to become a reality\u2014and, more importantly, if they want it to last\u2014they need to find new allies. Far-fetched as this may seem, social conservatives may be worth wooing. Of the institutions potentially available to regulate the lives of individual gays, marriage is the most socially conservative institution possible. Many proponents of same-sex marriage apparently believe that, since social conservatives are unlikely to be won over, they will simply have to be strong-armed into putting up with the institution when enough Democrats and enough states have shown their commitment. So advocates of gay marriage have mistakenly abandoned attempts to appeal to a base whose values may not be so far off from their own. Marriage is associated with long-term commitment, sexual monogamy, and other healthy lifestyle choices that are in line with socially conservative values. \n<br><br>Fewer and fewer Americans believe that gay Americans are gay out of lifestyle choice only. Presidential candidates John McCain and Barack Obama chalk sexual orientation up to some combination of biological and environmental factors. If they are right, then to oppose same-sex marriage is to oppose a societal avenue toward commitment, toward monogamy, and toward maintaining social structures that are in line with mainstream society. Given that a prevailing criticism of gay Americans is that their lifestyles are licentious, then encouraging them to pursue more conservative ends is an appropriate measure to make homosexuality less \u201cobjectionable.\u201d Social conservatives ought to get behind the right to same-sex marriage in their commitment to family values and traditional (albeit adapted) societal structures. \n<br><br>Similar arguments have been set forth by a handful of conservatives, chief among them Andrew Sullivan. Yet Sullivan falls down when he resorts to the argument that gay marriage should be legalized because it will make a great number of gay Americans much happier. Sullivan calls the pursuit of happiness \u201cthe birthright of every American.\u201d While this allusion to the Declaration of Independence\u2019s preamble is sweetly sentimental, there is no guaranteed right to happiness in the Constitution (and for good reason). By giving credit to this argument, Sullivan opens up the door to all sorts of claims of happiness and unhappiness that are completely relative. An opponent of gay marriage, for instance, could claim that the existence of the practice would make him personally miserable. Sullivan would do better to stay true to the conservative-values arguments that he makes elsewhere. Probably the strongest of these is that, given heterosexual couples\u2019 rocketing divorce rates, it is difficult to imagine that allowing gays to marry would greatly erode marriage success rates on the whole.\n<br><br>While a collective conservative conversion to this pro-gay marriage position may seem far off, it may not be, given how recently gay issues have even entered the political agenda. In 1984, then-presidential hopeful Walter Mondale was said to be courting the \u201chomosexual vote,\u201d as though acknowledging gay Americans as a voting bloc was an innovative strategy. Furthermore, even Mondale, a Democrat, felt he had to straddle the line between opposing gay lifestyles and approving of them, telling his political allies, \u201cThe trick is to say you\u2019re against discrimination without endorsing their lifestyle.\u201d Most mainstream candidates today would not dream of condemning gay voters. That a Democratic candidate could have said this as recently as twenty-five years ago serves to show the degree this struggle has advanced and what vast numbers of people can be won over. \n<br><br>Proponents of gay marriage will be most effective when they stop alienating social conservatives and opt to highlight the ways in which their own aims are consistent with the latter\u2019s values. It is not an adaptation of aims that is necessary, but rather an adoption of a strategy that privileges consensus over paranoid dogmatism. When this adoption comes to be, the country as a whole will benefit.\n<br><br>\n<br><br>Lucy M. Caldwell \u201909 is a history and literature concentrator in Adams House.

{"title": "The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>After two decades at the University of Chicago, legal superstar Cass R. Sunstein \u201975 is finally returning to Cambridge. The erstwhile \u2019Poonster and Currier House resident took time out to chat with FM about squash, animal rights, and wikis. <br><br>1. <br><strong>Fifteen Minutes (FM):</strong> You graduated from the College in 1975 and the stayed here to attend Harvard Law School (HLS). After being away for 30 years, how does it feel to return to your alma mater? <br><strong>Cass R. Sunstein (CRS):</strong> It is exciting because it feels like home, and because the Law School is in fabulous shape. There are so many excellent students and faculty at the Law School and all throughout the University. I am looking forward to a chance to work with undergraduates as well. <br><br>2. <br><strong>FM:</strong> What was your favorite class at Harvard? <br><strong>CRS:</strong> I think my favorite class was Walter Jackson Bate\u2019s [\u201939] famous course on Samuel Johnson. It was a magnificent class and inspirational. The class that most influenced me, though, was taught by Lloyd L. Weinreb, who later became a close friend of mine. His course introduced me to questions of justice and law. It wasn\u2019t as theatrical as the Bate course, but it was extremely good and it has had a huge impact on my career. <br><br>3. <br><strong>FM:</strong> You used to be quite the squash player, even playing for Harvard. Do you still play? <br><strong>CRS: </strong>I do. However, for all its virtues, Chicago is a small squash town compared to Boston and New York. The most I played squash recently was last spring when I visited HLS. I played three or four times a week. Now I play either squash or tennis three or four times a week. <br><br><br><br>4. <br><strong>FM: </strong>When did you know you wanted to go into law? <br><strong>CRS: </strong>My senior year in college I was torn between graduate school in English and law school. I thought that law would have more opportunities, and you could take a lot of different paths if you went into law. So not knowing exactly what to do, I took the path that seemed interesting and useful and also kept options open. <br><br>5. <br><strong>FM:</strong> Why constitutional law? <br><strong>CRS:</strong> After law school, I worked for the Office of Legal Counsel in the Department of Justice, which focused on constitutional questions. I also clerked for Thurgood Marshall and Benjamin Kaplan. Originally, constitutional law was the glamor field of law teaching. I thought that it would be really great if I had a chance to get involved in an area that helped define the nation\u2019s understanding of itself and possibly make a contribution. [...] It was endlessly exciting and an area in which if you figure something out you could help the system and that would be very rewarding. <br><br>6. <br><strong>FM:</strong> What was clerking for Thurgood Marshall like? <br><strong>CRS:</strong> It was an adventure. There was frequent drama because there were cases involving abortion, voting rights, the meaning of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, and more. Marshall himself was larger than life\u2014not self-important. He was full of amazing stories about presidents and civil rights leaders and great figures in American history\u2014many of whom he actually knew, such as the Kennedys, Lyndon Johnson, and Richard Nixon. Marshall was one of the world\u2019s best storytellers and I would say that every day was a privilege to be able to interact with him. <br><br>7. <br><strong>FM: </strong>If you could ask the Founding Fathers anything about the Constitution, what would you ask? <br><strong>CRS: </strong>I\u2019d ask them if they wanted their original understanding of their phrases should bind posterity\u2014if they think their original interpretation should bind people 100 and 200 years later. That is one of the great questions of constitutional law and it would be very fascinating to have a discussion with founders about that question. <br><br>8. <br><strong>FM: </strong>What is the most pressing legal issue facing the U.S. today? <br><strong>CRS: </strong>One very pressing constitutional question is the authority of the president to act on his own. Under what circumstances can the president act unilaterally? We don\u2019t know the answer to this. In terms of individual rights there are two obviously pressing questions\u2014the question of discrimination on the basis of disability on the constitutional side and in the interpretation of Americans with Disabilities Act, and the question of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. In terms of the horizon, the rights of nonhuman animals seem to me a quite pressing issue. I\u2019m walking my dog as we speak and he agrees with me. <br><br>9. <br><strong>FM: </strong>You wrote a book about aggregating information entitled \u201cInfotopia: How Many Minds Produce Knowledge.\u201d What are your thoughts on wikis? <br><strong>CRS: </strong>I think wikis are a promising device by which to pool diverse information, so I am upbeat on wikis. I have worked some with the CIA on how to aggregate disparate information there. On the other hand, it is true that there are vandals and malcontents who can defeat the project, so we are still learning about the domains in which open wikis work and the ways in which you need active administrators to make sure that disruptive things don\u2019t happen. <br><br>10. <br><strong>FM: </strong>What is your favorite book that you have authored? <br><strong>CRS:</strong> I have two favorites. One is called \u201cLegal Reasoning and Political Conflict\u201d from 1996 and the other is \u201cWhy Societies Need Dissent\u201d from 2003. But I recently completed two books and I am under contract to do four more so I hope that I will like one of those six better. <br><br>11. <br><strong>FM:</strong> Who are you pulling for in the presidential election? <br><strong>CRS:</strong> My friend and former colleague Barack Obama. I am a long-time admirer of his. I have worked with him since he ran for the Senate on an occasional and informal basis. While I have high opinions of Senator Clinton and John McCain, Obama is my favorite of the three. <br><br>12. <br><strong>FM: </strong>When you make the move to Cambridge in fall of 2008, you will be leading a new program on risk regulation. What is this program about? <br><strong>CRS: </strong>The idea is that a lot of the problems the nation and world are now confronting are really about risk. Examples include natural disasters, infectious diseases, climate change, terrorism and nuclear proliferation. There are common questions that cut across these issues\u2014how do humans actually think about risk? When do our thoughts go into the long term, that is, when do we consider the future? How can we get our legal institutions to focus on the long term rather than the short term? Those are very general questions. There are also some particular questions like, \u2018Is there a way to reduce the number of Americans who die in the workplace?\u2019 One of the reasons I\u2019m thrilled to come to Harvard is because the Harvard community has so much energy and ability, and I hope we can tap a fraction of that to approach these problems. Having taught at the Law School I can say that the diversity and ability of HLS students is almost beyond belief and I know from what I read that the level of creativity from the undergraduates is phenomenal. So if you have a place for people who are interested and bring their creativity to bear, like this new program, it might be that we will have a giant wiki and we will see what comes of it. <br><br>13. <br><strong>FM:</strong> You are currently the most cited law professor in the country. How much have you written and how do you have the time? <br><strong>CRS: </strong>I\u2019m too scared to see how much. I am sure I have written more than 12 books and pretty sure I have written more than 150 law review articles, but I don\u2019t keep a count. I can write in crevices\u2014meaning that if I have a half an hour between a class and meeting I can write in it. I don\u2019t actually work very long hours, but I don\u2019t need a lot of downtime during the day. So after a class if I don\u2019t have a meeting I can write, and before class I can write, so I think I write more than I otherwise would because if I have free time I can write in it. <br><br>14. <br><strong>FM: </strong>What did University of Chicago Law School Dean Saul Levmore mean in a Chicago Maroon article about your departure when he said that \u201cthere are a couple of personal reasons\u201d for your decision to leave? <br><strong>CRS: </strong>I have been at University of Chicago for over two decades. I love the place and I have no problems with my longtime home. When people leave one institution, often there is a sense of dissatisfaction with that institution and I don\u2019t have that. In terms of a career, it can be good to go someplace different, though. I wanted to make it clear to my colleagues that the reason is personal, it\u2019s not that I think there is anything lacking at the University of Chicago. Over the course of a career, being at two exciting institutions is better than being at one. <br><br>15. <br><strong>FM:</strong> What are you working on right now? <br><strong>CRS:</strong> I am most excited about a book called \u201cNudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness,\u201d which I co-authored with Richard Thaler. The basic idea of the book is that humans are amazing in many ways but cutting edge social science shows that we blunder and that our blunders make us poorer, less happy, and less healthy. The good news is that we are nudgeable through acts by private companies and governments. We can be nudged in directions that make us less poor, happier and healthier. <br><br></span></p>"}
{"title": "Theater of Politics | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>You can play in the hay, Hillary, but enjoy it while it lasts. Barack Obama said as much when he graciously commented last week that the embattled Hillary Clinton should stay in the Democratic nomination race \u201cfor as long as she wants.\u201d  Now her candidacy is in still more perilous standing following the departure of her chief strategist, Mark Penn. Obama\u2019s own outward magnanimity belies the broader political movement behind him, licking its chops at the dwindling hopes of the Clinton campaign. But months of mud-slinging aside, the candidates have provided a valuable political service to the American public.\n<br><br>First, we should pause before the gavel is brought down at last and applaud the zesty performance we have been given. The show these two have together provided for American voters and international spectators has been undeniably entertaining. Politicos everywhere have been gripping the edge of their seats for months as they followed the competition like diehard gamblers at a horse race. Furthermore, on a deeper level, the race has been surprisingly significant in leading America into an engaging political discussion it might not otherwise have had.\n<br><br>If we have learned anything from the ebb and flow of the Democratic primary\u2019s \u2018direction\u2019 as it has played out in the media, it\u2019s that whatever the pundits may prophesize, nothing is for certain. Clinton has shown impressive resilience, even as Obama and others have begun to sound like patronizingly benevolent parents who, sighing, allow their over-enthusiastic child to spend five more minutes in the sandbox. \n<br><br>Penn\u2019s  departure on Sunday  reflects a wider rise-and-fall trend among advisors on the campaign trail. Persistent sniping between surrogates and consultants has provided prime fodder for a political contest of tense and competitive edge. The transcript reads like a bureaucratized soap opera: Clinton New Hampshire co-chairman Bill Shaheen resigned after suggesting that Obama\u2019s past drug use would hurt his chances in the general election. Similarly, Obama adviser and Harvard faculty member Samantha Power had to step down from her campaign position after dramatically labeling Clinton a \u201cmonster.\u201d \n<br><br>On the other hand, Republican nominee John McCain\u2019s \u201cService to America\u201d biography tour\u2014effectively an attempt to kill time until the fall\u2014has been downright tedious.  His well-worn personality parade pales in comparison to the current mood of cliffhanger ambiguity that still hangs over the Democratic nomination. Suddenly, what has often been an automatic nomination process has been ignited with uncertainty and thus interest. The theatrical element to Obama and Clinton\u2019s tussle has generated public enthusiasm at a fever pitch, generating far more media coverage of the Democratic candidates and leaving the political veteran McCain overshadowed. As voices in the media have frequently reminded us, the prospect of either the first female or first black president is a revolutionary one indeed (especially in contrast to another white Republican man, no matter how distinguished).\n<br><br>Most importantly, this race has also led to the mobilization of the occasionally dispirited American electorate. If it takes the epic drama and emotion of a contentious primary to rustle the feathers of the electorate and get voter participation up, so be it. The past few months have seen troops of idealistic activists, young and old, manning phones and canvassing constituents for their candidate of choice. Might this race for the nomination prove more thrilling than the one for the White House? Probably not, but commentators and onlookers alike have already experienced more thrills than they did in all of 2004, and it\u2019s not yet May.\n<br><br>Everything must come to an end, and the Democrats\u2019 drum-roll is becoming more frantic with each passing day. Political pundits are honing in on the \u2018mathematical\u2019 probability that Obama\u2019s growing delegate lead will spell victory after or even before the remaining eight contests remaining have been settled. But before the verdict is announced, no matter its nature, anyone who has followed this roller coaster campaign trail with fervor or mere bemusement should appreciate what this extraordinary race has meant for America, and the tantalizing balance that, still hanging in the air, will only give way to a new one in August.\n<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Emmeline D.

{"title": "Jump off the Bandwagon | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Harvard College is a veritable treasure trove of diversity. Students converge here from all 50 states and numerous foreign lands, of all sorts of racial and ethnic backgrounds, with their own unique religious and cultural traditions. \n<br><br>Politics, too, admits of a wide range of distinction. Democrats, Republicans, and libertarians all have active contingents on campus; and despite the stultifying careerist influence of the Kennedy School, interesting political conversations can, with some effort, still be had.\n<br><br>Yet all this profusion of diversity\u2014from the Association of Black Harvard Women to the Harvard College Wisconsin Club, from the Christian Adventist Fellowship to the Secular Society, from the Radcliffe Union of Students to BGLTSA\u2014belies an oppressive and soul-crushing conformity.\n<br><br>Almost as soon as freshmen first arrive on campus\u2014in between awkward theatrical performances about contraception and date-rape, and ultimately futile, furtive searches for beer\u2014they begin to feign an interest in baseball just as the local team wraps up its season. No matter if they are from Baltimore or Bakersfield, Bucharest or Beirut, many Harvard students\u2014for a month at least in early autumn\u2014are rabid Red Sox fans.\n<br><br>As the 2008 season of our national pastime begins this month, Harvard students would do well to remember that baseball-team allegiances cannot be so credibly and honorably fabricated as, say, their recent enthusiasm for Barack Obama\u2019s presidential candidacy. These loyalties spring from years of careful attention, affection, and devotion, season after season of heartbreak alternating, regularly but unpredictably, with triumph. These are bonds formed not only over the course of a lifetime, but inherited intact from generations that have gone before.\n<br><br>Before 2004, the Boston Red Sox had not won a championship since 1918\u2014beyond the memory of most living fans at the time\u2014while having come so perilously close on many previous occasions. One would only have to whisper the names Bucky Dent, Bill Buckner, or Aaron Boone within earshot of a Boston fan to open the floodgates on a d\u00e9luge of painful memories, of golden opportunities wasted, bitter tears shed, and an entire life of constancy and devotion unrequited. \n<br><br>Were this sentimentalism not so pathetic, so crude, there would almost be something poetic, something tragically heroic in it. Almost.\n<br><br>Harvard students who have not known this experience\u2014with its attendant misery and self-pitying sadness\u2014cannot truly appreciate the World Series victory they only so recently saluted by their short and mindless, beer-infused revelry in the Square last October.\n<br><br>To some extent, this bandwagon mentality is utterly execrable in all sports. But in baseball, it is especially disgusting. \n<br><br>Unlike the NBA and the NFL, with their seamless integration into popular entertainment, their close affinities with the vapid celebrity culture of glossy magazines and MTV, and their nationwide audiences, professional baseball has generally remained a local affair. Teams count their most loyal devotees almost entirely within the regional base, and only seldom are regular-season games broadcast to a wider audience. Americans may, in theory, value mobility: but when it comes to baseball, carpetbagging fans, for good reason, are often shunned and scorned.\n<br><br>Baseball furthermore requires patience. Unlike most sports, in baseball there are no fixed time parameters and therefore no temporal obstacles for losing teams staging a comeback at the threshold of defeat. The season spans six months, with over 160 contests for each team, a time over which lengthy winning streaks can be gradually erased by tepid performance midsummer. \n<br><br>This requisite patience in turn counsels against the fair-weather fandom that dominates the Harvard campus annually around October\u2014that is, if the Red Sox have had a successful season. Well-intentioned and clueless Red Sox fans on campus perhaps can be forgiven for their feigned enthusiasm, for their understandable desire to imbibe the rich froth of Boston sports culture, for their all-too-human urge to \u201cfit in.\u201d \n<br><br>But their longing to enter \u201cRed Sox Nation\u201d\u2014the crypto-fascist public-relations campaign that the baseball club is currently promoting\u2014has earned them a counterfeit citizenship. Their interest is unsubstantiated by any connection to the team\u2019s history and traditions, the source for both the richness as well as the baseness of Red Sox fan culture. Baseball requires patience, dedication, and commitment\u2014all values that have lost their pride of place among most Harvard students, especially those who cheer for the Sox.\n<br><br>If these bandwagon fans succeed in ruining the self-pitying and self-gratifying Boston Red Sox tradition, it will be no great loss. But if this trend accelerates, baseball will, like other professional sports, sink deeper into the ignominy of our soulless entertainment culture.\n<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Christopher B.

{"title": "That Old-Time Religion  | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Charlton Heston, the great screen actor who graced sets from the Egypt of the Old Testament to the Planet of the Apes, passed away a few days ago. A notable conservative who marched with Martin Luther King, Jr., he would later serve as the president of the National Rifle Association. Before the onset of the Alzheimer\u2019s that claimed his life, Heston was often just a punch line for jokes about Soylent Green and gun nuts, but in truth he was a lot more than that. \n<br><br>His passing, like that of William Buckley, godfather of modern conservatism, is part of a broader tragedy of the American political landscape. There may have been a lot to dislike about the old right\u2014Buckley initially supported segregation, for example, and Ronald Reagan\u2019s foreign policy was marred by the Iran-Contra unpleasantness\u2014but there was a lot to like about it, too. And when faced with the Republican Party of today, I don\u2019t care who you are\u2014you\u2019ll find yourself missing that old-time religion. \n<br><br>Following the \u201cliberal consensus\u201d of the postwar era that invaded Vietnam and ushered in the economic crisis of the 1970s, the movement that trumpeted economic freedom, individualism, and rational foreign policy made understandable electoral sense. Under Reagan, the Carter malaise was reversed, and economic policies were put in place that Clinton and the Bushes left untouched with great success. Communism fell without a missile fired, and foreign policy was managed without disastrous invasions; when Bush Sr. invaded Kuwait, he resisted the temptation to follow Saddam\u2019s forces back to Baghdad, with his Defense Secretary, Dick Cheney, predicting a \u201cquagmire.\u201d  Gingrich pared down the unwieldy federal government and reformed the broken welfare system, and William Buckley called for an end to the senseless war on drugs .\n<br><br>What killed off this old-time religion of freedom-loving pragmatism? First of all, it was religion. For all of the ideals of the movement, it was an alliance with God-and-guns evangelicals that brought Reagan to power. However, neither Reagan nor Bush Sr. were born-again zealots: under their leadership, abortion, school prayer, and other banner issues of the megachurches remained untouched. \n<br><br>But there\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch. The sitting Bush administration has dedicated more and more lip service to hot topics like gay marriage. And in 2008, Huckabee\u2014a man who really puts the Bible into Bible Belt\u2014surged in the primaries, even after McCain was the obvious winner. He may have lost, but this was as close to an open revolt as you can get amongst Republicans; dissatisfied with past administrations, evangelicals decided to collect on their bargain with the American right. \n<br><br>The other force that demolished the stately edifice of old conservatism was Bush himself. During his tenure, federal spending has risen at an average rate unmatched by any president since Lyndon B. Johnson\u2014those \u2018small government principles\u2019 were unceremoniously trashed.    And in the name of the War on Terror, the Republicans have become the party of the Patriot Act and the Military Commissions Act, which effectively put paid to habeas corpus and a slew of other civil liberties. \n<br><br>Where is the party that opposed Clinton\u2019s interventions in Kosovo  and ran explicitly against nation-building in 2000? The neoconservative jihad in Iraq has managed to conflate conservatism itself with perpetual warfare: A solid 65% of Republicans still support the management of the war.  \n<br><br>McCain, the candidate to preserve the Republican regime, is notably not of the evangelical persuasion, but he has prostrated himself before them, trumpeting his opposition to abortion and promising to nominate socially conservative judges\u2014and he\u2019ll be held to those promises.   He is also unabashed about his strong belief in the wonders of military solutions to our problems, is no tax-cutter himself, and has pushed for federal control of everything from baseball  to cigarettes , elements perhaps overlooked during the collective swooning of newspaper editorial boards. \n<br><br>We\u2019re far from the days when Ronald Reagan, in his 1964 speech for Barry Goldwater, promised America the \u201cultimate in individual freedom consistent with law and order.\u201d  Until it finds its way back out of this mess, the Republican elite promises us a platform of war abroad, and a massive, intrusive government at home.

{"title": "The Wrong Type of Peace | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Barack Obama would no doubt recognize the protest of the defeated Celtic chief Calgacus to the Romans occupying his homeland: \u201cAtque ubi solitudinum faciunt pacem appellant,\u201d that is, \u201cThey create a desolation and call it a peace.\u201d The phrase is a famous critique of the type of peace armies and occupation can bring and has no been invoked in columns and essays to argue against the American invasion of Iraq from day one. If elected as America\u2019s next president, Obama risks creating a different kind of desolation in Iraq, caused not by an excess of American power, but an insufficiency. <br><br> Obama is selling himself as the President to settle the peace, not continue the war. Yet some of the senator\u2019s recent comments suggest he has far less of an interest in peace than in popularity. In an Associated Press interview from July 2007, Obama suggested that even the likelihood of genocide was insufficient grounds for retaining an American presence in Iraq. \u201cIf that\u2019s the criteria by which we are making decisions on the deployment of U.S. forces, then by that argument you would have 300,000 troops in the Congo right now\u2014where millions have been slaughtered as a consequence of ethnic strife\u2014which we haven\u2019t done.\u201d Obama is implying America should bear as much responsibility for the security of citizens in a country we do not occupy as one we do. That is, none at all.<br><br>The irony is that Senator Obama has been a strong advocate of international intervention in Darfur, where a genocide has been raging since 2003. In 2006, Obama made a passionate defense of the use of the term genocide to describe the conflict. \u201cWhen 300,000 people have been killed, 2 million displaced, I think that that is the kind of disaster that merits world attention and world action.\u201d These are strong words from a man proposing to end the American military presence in Iraq by the end of next year.<br><br>By vying for the votes of 60 percent of Americans who believe the United States should make its exit from Iraq as soon as possible, Obama is guilty of the worst sort of pandering. In speech after speech Obama has elevated his opposition to the war into a platform for election. \u201cI opposed this war from the beginning. I opposed the war in 2002. I opposed the war in 2003. I opposed it in 2004 and 2005 and 2006...And I am here to say that we have to begin to end this war now.\u201d <br><br>Obama should be reminded that opposing war is very different from ending it. As bad as things in Iraq might now be, anyone can see that a total absence of American troops would have terrible human and strategic consequences: no Iraqi state government, a full-blown ethnic showdown between Sunnis and Shiites, Kurdish independence leading to conflict with Turkey, and the discourse of Islamic extremism would be vindicated. In addition, this \u2018Iraq-sized\u2019 no-man\u2019s land reminiscent of Somalia, would be between Israel and Iran. Where the proceeds of the sale of Iraq\u2019s oil\u2014currently at $109 a barrel\u2014would go can only be imagined, but funding regional and international jihad is a plausible guess. All of this composes a universally terrible outcome, particularly for the Iraqi people. The suggestion that withdrawing troops would bring peace is thus a dangerous fiction. Worse still is the suggestion that it would save lives or increase American legitimacy in the region. Withdrawal simply subjects Iraq to America\u2019s imperial disinterest and will allow far more terrible forces of desolation to overtake its people.<br><br>Such a clever and evidently capable Democratic candidate can do enormously better on foreign policy, but until he proves otherwise, Obama should be identified as an isolationist and a threat to the many gains in security achieved recently in Iraq. As Obama argues, fighting a war \u201cwithout end\u201d in Iraq will not necessarily make America a safer place, even if it does forestall some very unpalatable outcomes. However, keeping boots on the ground between the Tigris and Euphrates will certainly make a positive difference to the security of Iraqis. Removing the occupying force will render Obama\u2019s bold claim that he will \u201cend this war\u201d sickeningly ironic. The truth is he will begin one, and a national bloodletting far more intimate and ferocious than anything thus seen in Darfur\u2014or Iraq\u2014will be all but inevitable. The salient question is whether Iraqi humanity or American war fatigue should be privileged in the nation\u2019s foreign policy. Obama seems to think it should be the latter.<br><br>American citizens should think twice about what will surely befall Iraq if they don\u2019t oppose Senator Obama\u2019s shotgun evacuation. A few more years of occupation won\u2019t kill America, but Iraq would in all likelihood be spared the worst violence of its troubled history. That would indeed be a foreign policy of commendable foresight and a peace worth fighting for.<br><br><br><br><br><br>D. Morgan Potts \u201908 is a history concentrator in Eliot House.</span></p>"}

{"title": "The Bitter End | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "The Crimson Staff", "body": "<p><span>Few social blocs in America have been all at once so mythologized and so misunderstood as rural voters. Nor have many been so cynically manipulated into voting against their own interests. The last 30 years of American politics have witnessed an extraordinarily duplicitous\u2014and, unfortunately, extraordinarily successful\u2014program by conservative politicians and commentators to annex small-town America by shamelessly pandering to ugly stereotypes that paint rural voters as religiously minded, gun toting, nativists. Now that tradition can count amongst its ranks another prominent practitioner in the form of Hillary Clinton, who, in the face of increasingly onerous roadblocks in her path to the nomination, has elected to employ the tired old cultural bludgeons which have long misrepresented rural voters as something that they themselves rarely recognize.<br><br>In the past week, the Clinton campaign has seized on Barack Obama\u2019s suggestion that rural voters \u201ccling\u201d to religious fundamentalism and anti-statism because they have seen no real governmental redress for their economic woes, turning it into a blanket charge of elitism against Obama. Copping her lines almost directly from 30 years of Republican smear literature, Clinton assessed Obama\u2019s rhetoric as out-of-touch with supposedly authentic heartland values. Her surrogates quickly jumped into line to help paint Obama in the political poison-cloud of liberal snobbery.<br><br>These tactics of Clinton\u2019s are not the tactics of well-intentioned democratic politics. They are the tactics of a campaign in the paroxysms of electoral death. And, as a consequence, the tenor of American political discourse ratchets one notch lower. It is unfortunate that any candidate who strays even the slightest bit from the accepted narrative of cultural pandering is immediately branded a cultural elitist. It is even more so that such a branding is coming from someone who\u2019s supposed to be on the same side. <br><br>What\u2019s particularly tragic about this situation is that this myth of the \u201cheartland\u201d ethic is by and large a phantasm constructed by conservative elites in order to frighten liberals away from drifting towards populism. In reality, rural America has been the site of some of the nation\u2019s most radical political movements. Eugene Debs, the prominent socialist of the turn of the century, was a proud resident of Terre Haute, Ind. Lyndon Johnson, the architect of the century\u2019s most far-reaching liberal programs, was born a poor Texan. Rural Americans, just like their urban counterparts, are a complex group, full of competing opinions on politics, culture, and religion, yet we continue to treat them as one-dimensional pawns in the bloody arena of political point-scoring.<br><br>An issue such as gun control reveals the sorry state of political self-censorship which these assumptions have drawn us into. The fact that the Democratic Party cannot even have an open discussion on the Second Amendment out of fear that they will be crippled by a cultural bludgeon is indicative of the extent to which we have all collectively bought into this cultural trap. Certainly many rural Americans have a wide variety of reasons for opposing gun restrictions. But to claim that there exists a single \u201crural America\u201d that universally rejects such proposals and considers suggestions to the contrary as a cultural affront is not only wildly incorrect, it\u2019s insulting.<br><br>No doubt Obama\u2019s comments could have been more tactfully delivered. But so could almost any political statement, and the fact that the Clinton campaign has so brutally wielded his words against him is an unfortunate commentary both on the state of her own campaign and of the American political landscape in general.<br><br></span></p>"}

{"title": "The Crack in the Glass Ceiling | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Many Democrats insist that prejudice is keeping women and minorities out of politics and business. In this frame, their presidential candidates are appealing. If Senator Barack Obama wins the nomination, racism will recede from the inner city. If Senator Hillary Clinton wins, sexism will exit the boardroom. According to these ideologues, economic success is tied to political success, and one must occur for the other to follow. <br><br>History, however, suggests the opposite. Political success is separate from economic success, and culture causes many of the gender and racial divides in our country. <br><br>But racism makes for a much scarier bogeyman. In his recent speech on race in in Philadelphia, Obama warned, \u201c\u2026many of the disparities that exist in the African-American community today can be directly traced to inequalities passed on from an earlier generation that suffered under the brutal legacy of slavery and Jim Crow.\u201d <br><br>Unfortunately, Obama\u2019s track from 1863 to 2008 railroads the facts. Economist Thomas Sowell recounts reality in his book, \u201cEconomic Facts and Fallacies.\u201d Today, African Americans have the lowest marriage rate of any racial group in the country, and lower labor force participation rates than whites. At the turn of the 20th century, however, blacks had higher marriage rates than whites. They also had higher labor force participation rates than whites in every census from 1890 to 1950. The problems that Obama cites are recent trends, not ancestral legacies. <br><br>Still, these trends are troubling. At the end of the twentieth century, only ten percent of two-parent African-American households lived below the poverty rate, but an absolute majority of single-parent African-American households did. Married couples share certain qualities that make them more likely to succeed. Indeed, the breakdown of the family is one reason for the recent lag in economic progress among African Americans. And the fewer African Americans who are working, the less likely that greater numbers of them will rise out of poverty. <br><br>Moreover, African Americans made greater economic progress before they jumped political hurdles. The percentage of African American families below the poverty line dropped 40 percentage points between 1940 and 1960, before Congress passed any important civil rights legislation.But from 1960 to 1980, the poverty rate among African American families fell only 18 percentage points, even after social programs like the War on Poverty and affirmative action took root. The restoration of African Americans\u2019 civil rights wasn\u2019t responsible for their economic standing. <br><br>Racism doesn\u2019t always prevent minorities from prospering, as Sowell explains in another book, Ethnic America. When Japanese immigrants arrived in California at the end of the nineteenth century, the state government forbade them from owning land. In 1942, the federal government forced over 100,000 Japanese Americans into internment camps. During the upheaval, Japanese Americans lost many of their belongings, worth around $400 million in 1942 dollars. <br><br>Despite these political setbacks, Japanese Americans worked longer and harder than their white counterparts in menial, low paying jobs. They insisted that their children graduate from school to capitalize on these initial gains. As a result, Japanese Americans today earn higher annual incomes than whites, though they hold only several hundred political offices nationwide. Their economic success doesn\u2019t rely on political power. Political success doesn\u2019t always translate into economic success either. The Irish, for example, controlled the police forces and fire departments of most major American cities by the late nineteenth century. For years, they governed capitals like Boston and New York, and blackballed Jews and Italians from their political machines. Still, Sowell notes, \u201c\u2026[in America,] the Irish were the slowest rising of the European ethnic groups.\u201d <br><br>Racism exists, but it doesn\u2019t explain many of the economic disparities among minorities. Sexism is the other scapegoat that Democrats fleece. Clinton often sobs that women earn \u201cjust 77 cents for every dollar that a man makes.\u201d But those 23 cents aren\u2019t lining some sexist employer\u2019s pockets. Because women are the only ones who can have children, they are more likely to take time off to care for those children, losing experience and seniority. To devote more time to family, many women choose fields that allow greater flexibility in their schedules, and, consequently, pay less. <br><br>The earlier women have children, the less likely they are to earn a doctorate or land a high-paying job. After World War II, the baby boom began a boost in the birth rate and a drop in the median age of marriage. In return, women\u2019s share of doctorates declined. Before World War II, however, women earned larger shares of doctorates than they did during the 1950s or 60s. In fact, women\u2019s share of doctorates hit a record high in 1972\u2014the same percentage it had reached in 1932. <br><br>Most importantly, we must compare apples to apples. According to one study that Sowell cites, \u201cAmong college-educated, never-married individuals with no children who worked full-time and were from 40 to 64 years old\u2014that is, beyond child-bearing years\u2014men averaged $40,000 a year in income, while women averaged $47,000.\u201d Lifestyle choices are behind the \u201cgender gap,\u201d not sexism. Unless Clinton outlaws pregnancy, I doubt her presidency will affect women any differently than Obama\u2019s. Most Americans can succeed regardless of their race or gender. In many cases, culture makes all the difference. If Obama and Clinton want to make history, they could acknowledge this fact. But if they did, they\u2019d be Republicans. <br><br><br><em>Brian J.

Harvard\u2019s class of 1967 appropriated the first half of this particular idiom last December when warning of the \u201ccareerist, vocational orientation\u201d to which many colleges today subscribe, and lamenting the \u201cwidespread apathy and political indifference\u201d on display in post-millennial Harvard undergraduates.<br><br>This letter, now nearly forgotten, always seemed to be born from Sixties sanctimony, but it was correct in its observation that socialism and political Marxism are more or less gone from the hearts and minds of Cambridge\u2019s collegiate population. Why? The letter recommends a task force to locate the source of political lethargy, but on this, the anniversary of the Army-McCarthy hearings\u2019 first day, I\u2019ve got my own blaming to do.  <br><br>Frankly, Harvard seems destined to a lofty place in the bourgeois cosmos, today re-established after decades of deviation from the path of the Boston Brahmin, all of us again participating in just the \u201cnaked self-interest\u201d Marx inveighs against in his manifesto. No one expresses more than a tinge of voiceless, \u2018moral\u2019 disgust at the flagrant, moustache-twirling greed of those attending info session after Goldman Sachs info session; these shock troops of the global market get a free pass (except of course from the aging vigilantes in the Class of 1967).<br><br>Our shepherds, the professors, cannot be let off the hook. After all, their dabbling with the dialectic seems to have dropped off entirely in recent decades. We laugh, but the communist clique at the Faculty Club was once a menace all its own; in 1949 Professor John Edsail \u201923 fumed: \u201cCommunists are shifty, and treacherous colleagues, and I do not wish to collaborate with them in any program of political or social action.\u201d No such treachery these days; at very most, our faculty features a handful of zany libertarians and communitarians\u2014all no doubt collegial, cooperative folks.<br><br>Professor of government Harvey C. Mansfield \u201953 might explain a bit of collective hesitancy amongst the faculty to rejoin the revolutionary party after a period of sad separation; 1991 found him saying he was \u201cglad to see [Marxism] dead and gone\u201d and planning \u201cto keep a careful watch to stomp on it\u201d should it reawaken. What exactly this \u2018stomping\u2019 might constitute remains unclear, but we can only assume that hundreds of Mansfield\u2019s colleagues have \u2018disappeared\u2019 when they wouldn\u2019t keep their mouth shut about the proletariat.<br><br>At any rate, current students seem to have forfeited Marx and Engels to an even greater degree than their instructors. When, in 1953, Crimson editors got hold of the Ibis that sits atop a certain semi-secret Sorrento Square organization that used to occasionally publish a humor magazine, the natural decision was to send it to the Soviet Union. Who knows what nemesis state would even have it today, or whether we\u2019d have the cajones to send it to them? Kim Jong-Il would probably like it, but he seems like small (crazy) potatoes after Stalin\u2019s enormous (crazy) feast.<br><br>Now, when Harvard undergraduates invoke the father of communism, it\u2019s not as a political herald but as a conversation piece for social studies concentrators. Even then, Marx is a little too mainstream; when trying to communicate one\u2019s extraordinary acquaintance with great thinkers, his monosyllabic moniker gets lost amid the sea of Walter Benjamins and J\u00fcrgen Habermases (the more strange accents, the more intellectual firepower).<br><br>Today, striving for revolution seems a bit anachronistic: one student called Marxist ideology \u2018retro\u2019 in 1994, likening it to \u201cEasy-Rider biker gear.\u201d Nowadays, it\u2019s downright antique, the antithesis of hip. Imagine a communist partygoer, desperately trying to turn the conversation to surplus value over the strains of Soulja Boy\u2019s new single, \u201cYahhh!\u201d Unlucky fellow.<br><br>What was once a fiery outlet for leftist political fervor has been spoilt by a suite of suppressive bourgeois mechanisms; in its place slips the anesthetic comfort of supporting Barack Obama, perhaps \u2018preferring\u2019 Dennis Kucinich. Students themselves aren\u2019t to blame for this zeallessness, though, but the confluence of events utterly beyond our control.<br><br>Not least of which is one merely logistical in nature.

{"title": "Straight to the Top | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>History will not judge this kindly.  For many, in America and around the world, these words encapsulate an era in which our government has deceptively deprived individuals of civil liberties and basic human rights in the name of national security. Already, with nine months remaining in his tenure in office, President George W. Bush cannot flee from the scene quickly enough: The latest ABC News/Washington Post national poll showed 64 percent of Americans expressing disapproval of Bush\u2019s performance as president. \n<br><br>The statement above, however, also reflects the sentiments of Bush\u2019s own administration. These words, spoken by former Attorney General John Ashcroft, illustrate a fresh outrage that has been largely overlooked amid the manifest \u201cBush fatigue.\u201d  \n<br><br>According to ABC News, in the years following September 11, 2001, the principle members of the President\u2019s National Security Council held meetings within the White House Situation Room in which they \u201cdiscussed specific high-value al Qaeda prisoners and exactly how those prisoners would be interrogated.\u201d\n<br><br>The \u201cprinciples\u201d were led by then-National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice and included Ashcroft and Vice President Dick Cheney, along with Colin Powell, Donald Rumsfeld, and George Tenet, who at the time were Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, and CIA Director, respectively. According to ABC, these officials approved whether or not specific detainees \u201cwould be slapped, pushed, deprived of sleep, or subjected to simulated drowning called water boarding.\u201d The report went on to say that, according to its sources, approval at this level was so specific that \u201cthe interrogations were almost choreographed.\u201d \n<br><br>Ashcroft objected, in ABC\u2019s account, not to the appropriateness of the techniques proposed, but rather to the discussions taking place within such close proximity to the President.\n<br><br>Meanwhile, according to an article in the May issue of  Vanity Fair, some of the interrogation techniques that were involved were originally inspired by the television show \u201c24.\u201d\n<br><br>The debate about \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d\u2014known more colloquially as torture\u2014in itself stands little altered by these developments: It was clear long ago that torture produces little or no useful information while at the same time coming at a great cost to America\u2019s moral authority in the world, also leaving captured American soldiers at greater risk of mistreatment. \n<br><br>Rather, the new reports clarify the false pretenses under which the administration has presented the issue: They reveal the chain of complicity for specific abuses leads very directly to the highest levels of government. This should come as little shock by now, since a recurring theme of the current administration\u2019s abuses has been the irresponsible expansion of centralized executive power\u2014a propensity for legalistic avoidance of checks and balances that often amounts to changing the rules of the game.\n<br><br>Instead of the \u201cfew bad apples\u201d   blamed when the prisoner abuse first came to light over the Abu Graib incidents, it is clear that those highest in the level of command sanctioned specific methods of prisoner abuse. While the meetings referenced in the ABC report revolved around interrogation at the Guant\u00e1namo Bay detention facility, according to the Vanity Fair piece, \u201c[An] August 2006 report of the Pentagon\u2019s inspector general concluded unequivocally that techniques from Guant\u00e1namo had indeed found their way to Iraq,\u201d specifically to the Abu Ghraib prison. In fact, a month prior to the first abuses by Abu Ghraib\u2019s \u201cbad apples,\u201d two of the chief officials on the ground at Guant\u00e1namo Bay visited the Iraqi prison to make recommendations on interrogation techniques. \n<br><br>It is heartening that each of the remaining presidential candidates has denounced the current administration\u2019s position on torture. In this light, however, we are concerned with recent actions of presumptive Republican nominee  John McCain, who in February voted against a bill that would have banned the use of simulated drowning and other interrogation techniques on the grounds that the bill did not leave enough wiggle room for the CIA\u2014in his words\u2014\u201cto use extra measures\u201d in interrogating detainees.  (The bill passed and went on to be vetoed by President Bush.) \n<br><br>In light of the temptation for any new president to preserve expanded executive powers, an unambiguous renunciation of this administration\u2019s policy on torture will be a necessary condition for rebuilding American credibility in the world. And as tired as Americans may be of chronicling the disgraces of this presidency, the burden of passing judgment does not yet lie solely with the historians.\n<br><br></span></p>"}

Between now and then, the campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have a responsibility to the millions of Democrats who have participated in the election to maintain a basic level of civility. This applies equally to the candidates and their staffers and advisors. The sort of personal animosity that motivated Obama\u2019s advisor and Kennedy School professor Samantha Power\u2019s comment last week, calling Clinton a \u201cmonster,\u201d simply cannot be tolerated. Otherwise, this race risks devolving into nothing more than a flurry of negative advertising, which hurts the Democrats\u2019 chance of achieving the far more fundamental goal: defeating John McCain in November. Let this not simply be a war of attrition. \r<br><br>It may be hard to imagine now, but Democrats will eventually overcome the impasse at which they currently find themselves and nominate one candidate to head their ticket for the presidential election next November. Although in duration and money spent, the fight to capture the Democratic nomination might seem like the be-all-end-all, what we have seen so far is just the beginning. After the party convention in August, the nominee is will have to fight the real battle\u2014the one for the White House\u2014against John McCain. \r<br><br>To be sure, it would be na\u00efve to expect a primary of this magnitude to remain focused exclusively on policy issues. Considering how little actually separates Clinton and Obama, a campaign of this duration and expense will, in the tensest moments, necessarily involve some level of negative campaigning. Such is simply the case in modern American politics, and we recognize that. \r<br><br>Nonetheless, whatever immediate advantages one Democrat derives from negative campaigning against the other, they are nothing compared with the resulting fallout the party faces in the general election. If the campaign turns in to a gloves-off fight until the Pennsylvania primary, whoever emerges from the rubble will be in a considerably weaker position to face the Republican Party. If it is Hillary Clinton, the vicious campaigning will have served to remind voters of her divisiveness. This certainly seemed the case in South Carolina. If Barack Obama is the candidate, his message of a new, hopeful brand of politics will have been wholly undermined by insult warfare. Not to mention that an extended period of bare-knuckle politics threatens to undo all the energy the Democratic Party has amassed in a campaign that featured both the potential first female president and potentially the first African American. \r<br><br>For Samantha Power, the Pulitzer Prize winning journalist, professor at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, and senior advisor to Obama\u2019s campaign, calling Clinton a \u201cmonster\u201d is to tread in dangerous waters. And she rightfully resigned from the campaign. A comment made by a Clinton spokesman, Howard Wolfson, which compared Obama to Kenneth Starr, the independent investigator who uncovered Bill Clinton\u2019s affair with Monica Lewinsky, is hardly better. \r<br><br>Moreover, it does not matter that neither of these comments was made by the candidates themselves. In the game of politics, perception trumps reality, and both of these comments were unfortunately perceived as having come directly from the campaigns. The media portrayal and public perception are such that whether the attacks are accidental or strategic, the effect is just a deleterious for the Democratic Party. For the sake of the party, Clinton and Obama\u2014both the candidates and their staffs\u2014must avoid, as much as possible, regressing into trench warfare from here on out. Right now, it may seem like the nomination is everything, but at the end of the day, both must remember that they are Democrats. They have to keep their eyes on the prize.</span></p>"}

McCarthy \u201993, a lecturer on History and Literature and Public Policy and a member of Barack Obama\u2019s National   LGBT Leadership Task Force, put it best: \u201cRepublicans made Democrats look like the vessel for the homosexual agenda.\u201d \n<br><br>And yet I can\u2019t say that I am elated by the silence that lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) issues have received during this long and hard-fought race\u2014a race so often touted for breaking glass ceilings. I can\u2019t help but worry that this silence is the product of apathy among progressives in the fight to end homophobia rather than a sea change in America\u2019s opinion of LGBT people and their \u201clifestyles.\u201d \n<br><br>The country\u2019s acceptance of LGBT people has changed remarkably, of course, in the past generation, but the recent killing of a gay 14-year-old in Los Angeles by his classmate is just another reminder of how much work remains. If the \u201cceiling\u201d that still confronts LGBT people in this country\u2014\u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell,\u201d marriage prohibitions, and homophobia in general\u2014is going to be broken, silence will not be the tool that does it. \n<br><br>I have sympathy, however, for Democrats who say, \u201cWait. LGBT issues will only make us lose the election. Isn\u2019t it better to look the other way and make sure a Democrat gets elected? What will a Republican in the White House do for LGBT issues, anyway?\u201d \n<br><br>Nothing, I agree. But the cynic in me also questions whether a Democrat in the White House will ever vigorously support LGBT rights if he\u2014or she\u2014does not believe victory hinged on voters mobilized around this issue. \n<br><br>Bill Clinton, who Toni Morrison could have also called the \u201cfirst gay president\u201d because of his outreach to LGBT people in 1992, stepped away from his campaign promise to undo \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d as soon as he became president-elect in the face of a wave of opposition that startled him. Would a sitting Democratic president risk mobilizing the Right in 2012 by stepping out on a limb for LGBT rights? \n<br><br>The only way that a Democratic president will take that risk is if people concerned with LGBT issues give him or her a reason to. It\u2019s simply too much to ask of politicians to \u201cjust do it.\u201d Although Senator Clinton might disagree, Lyndon Johnson did not step in front of a segregationist truck for the Civil Rights Act in 1964; he jumped on a much bigger truck, driven by the people of the Civil Rights Movement, that was barreling through its opposition. \n<br><br>The hearts and minds of millions of Americans will not be changed by back-door negotiating and the swipe of a president\u2019s pen. Jacob P. Reitan, a prominent LGBT activist and current student at Harvard Divinity School, expressed disappointment in the state of LGBT activism precisely for this reason. \u201cThe LGBT community is very weak on raw action,\u201d he said. \u201cWe lobby Congress, work on getting votes for legislative decisions, but we rarely take to the streets to convince people of our rights.\u201d He asked, \u201cWhy haven\u2019t activists staged sit-ins at military recruitment centers, which immediately kick people out if they declare their homosexuality?\u201d I don\u2019t have any good answer for him, but if recent American history is any indication, actions like these will be crucial in shifting the country\u2019s landscape of acceptance. \n<br><br>So can I blame Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton for not waving the LGBT flag during this primary? No. I can point fingers at myself, however, and everyone else who intellectually supports LGBT rights but has yet to take up Reitan\u2019s call to action (which is so movingly portrayed in the new movie, \u201cFor the Bible Tells Me So\u201d). Much of the country has made remarkable progress over the past 20 years in its treatment of LGBT people, but we are far from any finish line. McCarthy described the situation perfectly to me: \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t ever be satisfied with where we are. Complacency is the death of democracy.\u201d \n<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Andrew D.

He will receive the Artist of the Year award at the opening show in Sanders Theatre.\r<br><br>Hancock has had a long and legendary musical career, recently capped by an Album of the Year Grammy Award for \u201cRiver: The Joni Letters.\u201d He has won 12 Grammys in total, as well as five MTV Awards. \r<br><br>\u201cHe was very popular in the 80\u2019s, and his 2008 Grammy win shows he\u2019s still very popular now,\u201d said Matthew K. Clair \u201909, co-director of this year\u2019s first Cultural Rhythms show.\r<br><br>At age 11, Hancock embarked upon his musical career in a performance with the Chicago Symphony, and he has been a towering figure in jazz ever since.\r<br><br>He received a contract from Blue Note records in 1961, creating such albums as \u201cMaiden Voyage\u201d and \u201cSpeak Like a Child\u201d that heavily influenced modern piano composition and improvisation.  \r<br><br>Trumpeter Miles Davis recruited him as a sideman in 1963, and Hancock became a core member of what is known as Davis\u2019s \u201csecond great quintet.\u201d Through albums like \u201cIn A Silent Way\u201d and \u201cFilles de Kilimanjaro\u201d the group fused the abstract, single-chord song forms of free jazz with the electric instruments of funk and rock, creating a sub-genre called \u201cfusion\u201d that held tremendous sway during the 1970s and 80s.\r<br><br>Hancock left Davis\u2019 group in 1968 and began a long experimental relationship with funk music.

{"title": "Everyday Anarchy  | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Everyone\u2019s obsessed with politics these days. It\u2019s only natural; we\u2019re in the middle of the most contentious presidential campaigns in history, and it doesn\u2019t help much to be reading the unceasing back-and-forth on editorial pages, either. The media has gleefully stoked the public obsession with this election, with 24-hour coverage of delegate breakdowns and speculation about Hillary\u2019s \u201cbreakdown\u201d and McCain\u2019s \u201caffair.\u201d\r\n<br><br>But fixation on politics distracts from the things that matter most. I implore you, those who pore over every rise or fall in the polls, who hash out the byzantine intricacies of health care or foreign policy, to do a simple thing: Embrace the anarchy in your life. I don\u2019t mean for you to take up a black flag, riot in the streets, or shoot President McKinley. I mean something that is more human than political wonkery, something you forget as you are overcome by primaries and polls. Politics is important, but some things in life should remain personal. \r\n<br><br>By anarchy, I mean the little things you do without subordinating yourself to some greater cause or heeding some elected authority. It\u2019s all the wonderful things that happen in your life without a warrant, a subpoena, an audit, or a friendly letter from the Department of Motor Vehicles. It\u2019s buying toothpaste at CVS and it\u2019s gossiping with your friends\u2014about someone other than Barack Obama. The change we can believe in is the change you do on your own, whether it\u2019s swearing off all-nighters in Lamont or embracing them. \r\n<br><br>Rejoice in your everyday anarchy, because politics is by necessity a zero-sum game; one candidate will win and others will lose. Obama surges, Clinton crashes. Republicans gain a House seat, the Democrats drop one. Of course, there\u2019s a place for politics, and its well and good to devote time and thought to it, but at some point we have to take a break from red and blue maps, from tables of poll numbers, from endorsement speeches, and from the scandal du jour. \r\n<br><br>What\u2019s wrong is to see politics, as many do, as the alpha and omega of our lives. While some have called our generation apathetic or disengaged, we on the inside are perhaps more susceptible to political mania than any before us\u2014particularly at Harvard. Here, for every burnt out non-voter, there\u2019s two or three more that will start stumping for their favorite horse at the drop of a hat. These people have become so immersed in the argument against one political camp or ideology that they\u2019ve entirely forgotten the argument against politics at large: namely, that nothing should matter this much.\r\n<br><br>The tide doesn\u2019t seem set to turn soon, either; American government-as-religion seems set to win more converts, not to dissolve. For example,  Obama has interspersed his soapbox oratory with calls for a new \u201cnational service,\u201d one that aims to instill an optimistic sense of duty and country in young Americans like ourselves. Meanwhile, McCain has mused of regiments of uniformed young charity workers living in barracks, a return to the days of the Civilian Community Corps . But it\u2019s hard to see how pressuring or coercing our youth for months or years will make them love their fellow Americans\u2014meaning more likely their government. \r\n<br><br>So the current obsession with \u201cyouth involvement\u201d is very nice, but it already looks to have gone too far. We can\u2019t send every problem to Washington to solve, and we can\u2019t all become political pundits or state employees\u2014even the idea is reckless and blinkered. Decry aspiring investment bankers all you like, but someone has to make the money that Washington spends. The wonderful part of America, or what America should be, is the ability of a person to ignore politicians and politics as much as possible. Love your inner anarchist, and put down the newspaper\u2014or at least read the funnies. \r\n<br><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Daniel C.

{"title": "The Ron Paulization of Obama | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>This primary season has seen an unprecedented rise in Democratic voter turnout and the man to thank seems to be Barack Obama, whose charisma and message of political change has prompted a surge in grassroots political activism. But as gratifying as it is to see otherwise apathetic voters\u2014especially students\u2014getting excited about politics, much of the Obama grassroots has focused not on substantive policy-based support, but on mindless hero-worship. To see this phenomenon firsthand, there\u2019s no better place to turn that than that ubiquitous record of the modern zeitgeist: Youtube.com.\n<br><br>It all began last June when Amber Lee Ettinger\u2014also known as \u201cObama Girl\u201d\u2014captured America\u2019s hearts and minds with her music video, \u201cI\u2019ve Got a Crush on Obama.\u201d The video, which features Ettinger lip-syncing and dancing next to photos of Obama, is noticeably lacking in any real political message, but nonetheless became an overnight internet sensation. This was followed by range of similarly inane videos. Some, like the \u201cBabies for Obama\u201d series\u2014in which parents goad their confused children into saying things like \u201cI love Obama\u201d\u2014took Obama obsession to a new level.\n<br><br>Recently, members of mainstream entertainment industry also seem to have drank the Obama Kool-Aid. The \u201cYes We Can\u201d video, which features the Black Eyed Peas\u2019 Will.I.Am, Scarlett Johansson, and other celebrities chanting Obama\u2019s New Hampshire primary speech, has popped up all over the internet. From the feigned emotion on these celebrities\u2019 faces, one would think they were reading from the Bible or Shakespeare, not from a relatively well written but somewhat politically banal stump speech. Nonetheless, this nauseating video has now become the new symbol for Obama\u2019s grassroots support.\n<br><br>All this may constitute what some pundits have labeled a \u201ccult of personality.\u201d Unlike a traditional cult, however, the rise in Obama worship seems to have emerged as a groundswell from among the general public, not as the product of a planned campaign strategy. Indeed, Obama seems to be the latest victim of a political trend that most recently subsumed Republican candidate Ron Paul. A staunch Libertarian, Paul is certainly one of the more eclectic politicians running for president\u2014his opposition to the Iraq War and free trade made him a pariah in most of the Republican debates. \n<br><br>Despite how unusual Paul\u2019s political views may be for a Republican candidate, the intensity, persistence, and downright craziness of his grassroots support overshadowed his official campaign through primary season. Paul\u2019s supporters, including many members of the \u201c9/11 Truth\u201d movement\u2014those who believe that the U.S. government was complicit in 9/11\u2014released a range of unofficial videos and pamphlets idolizing Paul as a kind of Messianic figure. The conspiracy theories and cult-like behavior of Paul\u2019s grassroots supporters has alienated many voters and forced Paul to repeatedly distance himself from much of his unofficial support.\n<br><br>The problem with the mindless, cult-like behavior that sunk the Paul campaign and is now beginning to take hold of Obama backers, is that this kind of support often takes on a life of its own and becomes unmanageable by politicians or official campaigners. Although Obama probably doesn\u2019t have to worry about his supporters embracing conspiracy theories, there are other potential political liabilities to the rise in Obama worship.\n<br><br>What has recently become clear is that an obsessive love of Barack Obama seems to go hand-in-hand with an obsessive hatred of Hillary Clinton. The more Obama\u2019s supporters idolize him as a Messianic, transformative figure, rather than simply supporting him because of his political position or qualifications, the more they attempt to demonize Hillary Clinton as the anti-Obama\u2014the calculating, deceptive anti-Christ out to sabotage Obama\u2019s chances of becoming president. While Clinton-bashing was once solely the domain of the Right, Obama supporters have recently entered the fray with a barrage of anti-Hillary videos and blog posts.\n<br><br>Though Obama may now be leading slightly in the delegate count, it is by no means certain that he will take the party\u2019s nomination. If Hillary Clinton were to win, the Democratic Party would be faced with a large number of obsessive Obama supporters not at all interested in supporting the woman who shot down their beloved champion. This scenario would surely mean victory for John McCain.\n<br><br>Although much of this Obama-obsession has been a grassroots phenomenon, out of Obama\u2019s control\u2014as in the case of Ron Paul\u2014the Obama campaign has done little to quell the tide of Obama hero-worship and Hillary bashing. Indeed, they have at times encouraged it. For example, Michelle Obama recently said that she would \u201chave to think about\u201d supporting Hillary, if she emerged as the Democratic candidate, a statement which bordered on treason from the perspective of the Democratic Party. The campaign also sent out the Black Eyed Peas\u2019 \u201cYes We Can\u201d video in their official e-mails, thus promoting the hype. Finally, the campaign has consistently portrayed Obama as the idealized \u201ccandidate of change\u201d far more than they have highlighted his impressive policy proposals. While \u201cchange\u201d is indeed a fundamental part of Obama\u2019s platform, failing to adequately link this message to genuine political issues laid the groundwork for the kind of character-over-substance mentality of many Obama supporters.\n<br><br>If the Obama campaign wants to demonstrate that they care about the future of the Democratic Party as much as they care about Obama\u2019s own political aspirations, they need to tone down the more sensationalistic aspects of Obama\u2019s political persona. It\u2019s time to see more concrete ideas and less flowery oratory in his speeches. But more importantly, he needs to distance his official campaign from Obama Girl, Black Eyed Peas, and the rest of the grassroots, Obama-obsessed rabble. Cult-like behavior should be left to Ron Paul\u2019s campaign, where it belongs.<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Jacob M.

In every presidential election since 1992, Nader has thrown his hat into the ring, hoping his long-shot candidacy will reshape the American political landscape. Last Sunday, we found out that 2008 will be no exception, as that esteemed elder statesman of presidential politics (at 74 years of age he makes John McCain look youthful) announced that he would enter the fray once more. \r\n<br><br>Nader has his reasons for making another try at Pennsylvania Avenue\u2014he thinks many significant issues like military spending, labor reform, and \u201ccracking down on corporate crime\u201d have been largely ignored in mainstream political dialogue\u2014but one almost feels as if he\u2019s mainly running because he can. In an interview with The New York Times following his announcement, Nader claimed, \u201cIf there was no other reason to run\u2014other than the civil liberties, civil rights issue of ballot access\u2014it\u2019d be worth it.\u201d (He\u2019s a little miffed that Democrats campaigned so hard to keep him off the ballots in 2004, spoiling what otherwise would have been a glorious triumph.) \r\n<br><br>Perhaps it\u2019s difficult to break a habit after 16 years of perennial candidacy, but if Nader truly cares about the future of \u201cballot access\u201d and third-party presidential bids, he might do well to sit this one out.\r\n<br><br>Ralph Nader has become the great tragicomic figure of American politics: tragic because he may have indirectly delivered the 2000 election to George W. Bush, who has worked tirelessly to oppose virtually everything Nader spent his life promoting, and comic because every four years, he seems to forget what happened last time and trot back out, blissfully unaware of the impacts (or lack thereof) of his previous attempts. And this image, in turn, has become the face of third party candidacies in America. Every time he runs, Nader further assures the voting public that independent candidates are benign, irrelevant eccentrics at best, and truly pernicious egomaniacs at worst.\r\n<br><br>The animosity Nader engendered among liberals in 2000 by cavalierly proclaiming that George W. Bush and Al Gore were two sides of the same coin in an election ultimately decided by fewer people than it takes to fill a large movie theater will not disappear anytime soon. Shortly after his announcement, Democratic presidential candidates were quick to issue their condemnations, with Barack Obama quipping that Nader\u2019s \u201cfunction as a perennial candidate is not putting food on the table of workers\u201d and Hillary Clinton adding that, \u201cIt\u2019s not good for anybody, especially our country.\u201d \r\n<br><br>In this environment of overt hostility, it is unclear exactly what Nader hopes to accomplish other than further molding the American perception of third parties in his own image: cantankerous, irrelevant, and naively ignorant of practical consequences. But Soldier Ralph continues to fight on, like a houseguest who has overstayed his welcome by a decade or two. Maybe he\u2019ll come to his senses and finally bring an end to the unfortunate d\u00e9nouement of an otherwise distinguished career in public service. \r\n<br><br>If not, there\u2019s always 2012.<br><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Daniel E.

{"title": "Running for the Right Reasons | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Perhaps he wants to steal the distinction of being the oldest presidential candidate in 2008 from John McCain. (Nader turns 74 today; McCain is 71.) Perhaps he simply has nothing better to do. Whatever his reasons, lifelong consumer advocate Ralph Nader has once again decided to launch a long-shot presidential bid as a third-party candidate.\r\n<br><br>We respect Nader\u2019s right to run and agree that third-party candidacies strengthen our democracy by pressing the two major parties to take stronger positions on oft-neglected issues. But if Nader is running as a steward of democracy, we can\u2019t help but question his stated reason for candidacy.\r\n<br><br>On Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Nader justified his candidacy on the grounds that there is not enough enthusiasm for either of the major party candidates. For anyone who has been paying attention to the presidential race, Nader\u2019s reasoning rings hollow. Huge turnouts have been the hallmark of this primary season, particularly in the Democratic race. The historic candidacies of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have brought droves of new voters to the polls.\r\n<br><br>Nader\u2019s efforts to diminish the vibrancy of the Democratic race reinforces the popular perception of him as a vanity candidate. So long as Nader suggests that the two major parties are indistinguishable, he will do his own values a disservice.\r\n<br><br>In the 2000 election, Nader asserted that only a hairline of difference separated George W. Bush and Al Gore. In Florida, he siphoned 97,488 votes, likely from Al Gore, handing Bush a margin of victory of 531 votes. After two terms under Bush, few would dispute that a world in which Nobel Peace Prize winner Gore were president would come much closer to Nader\u2019s vision of the world than our own.\r\n<br><br>On \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Nader highlighted military spending, corporate greed, and labor rights as three issues that have been neglected in the 2008 campaign. To deflect criticisms that his entry into the race makes him a spoiler once again, Nader should focus on shifting the terms of the debate to include these issues, and in doing so, help foster that democratic discourse third-party candidates are able to foster.\r\n<br><br>After 74 years of life, Nader surely understands the reality of American politics: Either a Democrat or a Republican will be elected in November 2008. For that reason, Nader should ensure that his words are used to better the causes he advocates, not simply harm the candidate whose position most resembles his own.\r\n<br><br>Happy birthday, Ralph.</span></p>"}

So an important question arises: just when did the definition of black music become limited to hip-hop?<br><br>A large part of this musical segregation is owing to how off-putting and uniformly white the non-pop rock community is. That said, the power to work towards a desegregation of the genre is within reach, but for some reason, it has yet to come about.<br><br>For a similarly unknown reason, it has become treasonous within large parts of the African-American community for black artists to even consider straying outside of hip-hop, R&amp;B, or soul. I don\u2019t claim that young black music fans are living in a vacuum, but I think the future of music would be brighter if the value of being influenced by a range of musical traditions was embraced.<br><br>I am confident that, if culturally acceptable and encouraged, there would be more black fans of non-hip-hop music. I am evidence of the fact that it is\u2014at the very least\u2014a possibility. But there\u2019s something to be said about what many young black hip-hop fans (some of whom may be the Top 40 stars of the future) are losing by limiting themselves to simply \u201chearing\u201d non-black music as opposed to really listening to it.<br><br>Just as many a white Elvis fan in the 1950s had probably never picked up a Muddy Waters record, you\u2019d probably be equally unlikely to find many black Kanye fans who own a copy of Daft Punk\u2019s \u201cDiscovery.\u201d History has repeated itself, and that\u2019s a problem.<br><br>In his 2004 Democratic National Convention keynote speech, Sen. Barack Obama drew applause for speaking out against \u201cthe slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white.\u201d<br><br>What, then, of the slander that says a black kid listening to Bob Dylan isn\u2019t really black? And what of the claim that a black student who attends a Radiohead concert is betraying his race? While people may not be making these claims openly, the existence of these positions is well understood within the community. <br><br>Some of hip-hop\u2019s brightest stars, however, fail to even acknowledge the problem created by this kind of cultural isolationism and the musical inbreeding that it engenders. In a December 2007 Spin Magazine interview in which he discussed race and music, Kanye West said, \u201cI play to the stereotypes. I believe in the stereotypes. And I submit to them.\u201d <br><br>Here, Kanye accepts the rules as they are and concedes to playing by them. This mentality betrays the potential of the cultural position of black music today. We live in an unprecedented time, in which black artists frequently receive more airplay than white artists and in which the barriers to success are fewer than they\u2019ve ever been. While this rise to the top has been incredibly empowering for black artists, it has not created a dialogue between mainstream hip-hop artists and everyone else.<br><br>Imagine the places black artists in America could take us if the exploration of other cultures were encouraged and if such artists were unencumbered by the aforementioned self-segregation.<br><br>In his 2006 book \u201cEnough,\u201d NPR\u2019s Juan Williams writes, \u201cBlack politics (now) is still defined by events that took place 40 years ago...As a result, black politics is paralyzed.\u201d The cultural and artistic potential of black America is equally paralyzed by an outmoded and self-harming cultural isolationism. But the source of that isolationism\u2014and who\u2019s to blame for its continued existence\u2014are not as important as simply acknowledging that it exists and working toward ending it. <br><br>\u2014Columnist Ruben L.

Cutler \u201987 and Jeffrey B. Liebman were praised for providing Illinois senator Barack Obama with academic bona fides and guiding the Democrat\u2019s budget, health care, and Social Security policies.\r\n<br><br>Cutler, Harvard\u2019s dean of the social sciences, suggested that the role of academic economists in politics has become especially important in light of the country\u2019s most pressing problems.\r\n<br><br>\u201cHow do you get people to take up health insurance benefits that they\u2019re already eligible for? It\u2019s not an issue of money but an issue of something else,\u201d Cutler said in an interview.\r\n<br><br>Unlike Bill Clinton, who in 1992 used political philosophers and public intellectuals to advise him, Obama has instead surrounded himself with economists in order to find smarter approaches for health care and Social Security, the magazine said.   \r\n<br><br>Contrary to those who consider Obama an inexperienced leader and a bearer of empty rhetoric, Cutler said that the candidate possesses a healthy combination of general goals and specific, carefully weighed methods of implementation. \r\n<br><br>He said that this has become more apparent as Obama has faced off with rival Democrat Hillary Clinton in a series of nationally televised debates.\r\n<br><br>\u201cHe\u2019s put together as comprehensive and thorough a statement about what he wants to do as any president in the past,\u201d Cutler said.\r\n<br><br>Liebman, a public policy expert at the Harvard Kennedy School, said that Obama has taken into account the role of behavioral economics when considering the effect of policies on the decision-making of millions of Americans. \r\n<br><br>\u201cI think we\u2019re definitely seeing in this campaign, for the first time, the lessons of behavioral economics influencing policy proposals,\u201d he said.\r\n<br><br>Liebman said Obama has been careful to surround himself with a variety of experts.\r\n<br><br>\u201cWhen Obama gets briefed on an issue he really insists that an expert on an issue is in the room, and he really wants to have people with a wide range of views in the room,\u201d Liebman said.\r\n<br><br>Liebman added that Obama has been quick to get to the root of issues.\r\n<br><br>\u201cHe is very smart and he asks his advisors very tough questions and drills down to the heart of policy trade-offs.\u201d \r\n<br><br>Jarret A.

{"title": "Compassionate Campaigners | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>John McCain has 22 pets, including a ferret, two turtles, and three parakeets. Mike Huckabee has just two: a black Labrador named Jet and a Shih Tzu with the oddly non-conformist name of Sonic. As First Lady, Hillary Clinton wrote a book titled, \u201cDear Socks, Dear Buddy\u201d featuring letters that children had written to the First Pets, but now she just has Seamus the Labrador. Barack Obama has no pets, but true to the politics of hope, he has promised his two daughters he will get a dog when the election finishes.\n<br><br>Only four to 10 percent of Americans are vegetarian, but two thirds have a pet, and polls tell us that most of these people consider their pets to be family members, and many even say they\u2019d die for their pets. And while fewer than 13 million Americans now hunt, over 70 million observe, feed, or photograph wildlife on a regular basis. Of course, not all pet and wildlife lovers extend their concern with animals beyond their own Fido or favorite bird species, but many do, and they form a powerful new constituency against animal abuse. \n<br><br>This group of potential \u201canimal voters\u201d is news-savvy, socially integrated, and politically active. These are the suburban soccer moms who buy free range meat at Whole Foods, cosmetics not tested on animals from the Body Shop, and who quietly shun Ringling Bros\u2019 animal circus when it comes to town. They\u2019re also the people who sent over 300,000 e-mails to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell last July successfully urging him to drop convicted dog fighter Michael Vick from the league. They\u2019re politically active, and willing to use their votes to protect the defenseless.\n<br><br>This month, after the Humane Society of the United States exposed animal cruelty at a California slaughterhouse, animal voters made thousands of phone calls, sparking the closure of the plant and the biggest meat recall in U.S. history. And, in an unprecedented election event, they spurred the presidential candidates to issue statements condemning animal abuse, with Obama last week explicitly commending the Humane Society\u2019s investigation.\n<br><br>Animal voters are not card carrying PETA members, and they\u2019ve never picketed a KFC in their lives. But they care about animals, and they see a candidate\u2019s attitude to animals as a broader reflection of his compassion and character. That\u2019s why senators ranging from conservative Rick Santorum in Pennsylvania to liberal Robert Byrd in West Virginia have sought the Humane Society Legislative Fund\u2019s (HSLF) endorsement in their re-election bids.  Animal protection is what marketers call a \u201csignal issue\u201d\u2014something that shows voters that a candidate feels the way they do, quite apart from any specific policies.\n<br><br>In the 2008 election, animal voters have already spoken up. They held Mitt Romney to account when Time revealed that in 1983 he had strapped his dog to the roof of his car in a twelve-hour drive from Boston to Ontario (his first excuse that \u201cmy dog likes fresh air,\u201d did not go down well with animal voters). And they questioned Mike Huckabee\u2019s judgment when Newsweek alleged that, as Governor of Arkansas, he had intervened to stop an animal cruelty investigation into his son\u2019s hanging and stoning to death of a stray dog.\n<br><br>The beneficiaries of the animal vote have been Senators McCain, Clinton, and Obama. McCain has chalked up a strong track record on animal issues, co-sponsoring legislation to stop horse slaughter, opposing drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and voting to eliminate a two million dollar subsidy for the mink industry. Obama, meanwhile, has championed bans on horse slaughter and dog fighting, and surprised a Las Vegas town hall crowd in mid-January by telling them, \u201cI think how we treat our animals reflects how we treat each other, and it\u2019s very important that we have a president who is mindful of the cruelty that is perpetrated on animals.\u201d And Clinton has consistently opposed the slaughter of sick \u2018downer\u2019 cattle, amongst other pro-animal stances, earning her a perfect score of 100 percent on last year\u2019s HSLF Humane Scorecard.\n<br><br>In 1952, Senator Richard Nixon\u2014besieged by corruption allegations\u2014famously shifted attention with a televised reference to Checkers, a dog he had been given as a political gift. Nixon left the television studio downcast, but in the coming days, 250,000 Americans sent letters to the Republican National Committee endorsing Nixon, and defending Checkers the dog.\n<br><br>No President since Chester A. Arthur has entered the White House without a pet. Warren Harding campaigned with his Airedale Terrier, \u201cLaddie Boy,\u201d and gave the mutt his own chair at cabinet meetings. The Scottish Terrier \u201cFala\u201d belonging to Franklin D. Roosevelt \u201904 had his own Secret Service moniker and became an election issue in 1944 when FDR allegedly sent a destroyer to the Sandwich Islands to retrieve the dog after leaving it behind there. Calvin Coolidge once remarked that \u201cany man who does not like dogs and want them to be about does not deserve to be in the White House.\u201d\n<br><br>Maybe Obama should get his daughters that dog sooner.\n<br><br>\n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Lewis E.

{"title": "The Mechanics of Democracy | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>After 11 straight primary losses, it\u2019s do-or-die for the Hilary Clinton campaign. In last week\u2019s debate, she did. In three key rounds of policy boxing at Cleveland State University, the junior Senator from New York eloquently articulated the critical difference between the two proposed paths to universal healthcare coverage, defended a nuanced plan to navigate the dicey waters of NAFTA politics, and hammered home Senator Obama\u2019s relative foreign policy inexperience as a fundamental handicap for a potential Commander-in-Chief of the United States Armed Forces. And still, she could very well lose Ohio. <br><br>Senator Clinton\u2019s widely acknowledged strength in this year\u2019s Democratic debates makes her dizzying fall in the polls somewhat puzzling. The juxtaposition of her consistently strong performance in the policy realm with her patchwork poor performance at the voting booth begs a fundamental question: If not mastery of policy, just what criteria do Americans use to pick their president? Does it boil down to raw identity politics? Or, even worse, is Hillary-hatred based on factors as (literally) cosmetic as her brow and laugh? Are we truly to choose a commander in chief based on the candidate\u2019s marital history or a brief (albeit misguided) affinity for headbands? <br><br>The most obviously electric forces in this election, of course, are those of race and gender. After ingesting the January avalanche of pundit speculation in the wake of Iowa and New Hampshire, I too had chalked up my ambivalence about the two candidates to my own race and gender. I simply had to grit my teeth and decide which one was more important to me, which was in more dire need of \u201cchange\u201d: my status as a minority or my status as a woman. As the campaign wore on, however, I came to realize that I don\u2019t swing towards Hilary Clinton when I am feeling particularly feminine (or feminist, for that matter), and I don\u2019t get excited about Barack Obama when indignant about the social marginalization of Asian Americans. Rather, my strongest pro-Clinton feeling surge at the end of policy debates like last night\u2019s, and hot tears stream down my face as Barack Obama delivers magnificent speeches like those he gave at Dr. King\u2019s Ebenezer Baptist Church. Without doubt, there are many who will vote for or against Hillary and Barack on the sole basis of her extra x-chromosome and the color of his skin. But for the informed and thoughtful citizen, the much more interesting question at stake is less about demographics and more about the key skills required to be an effective president: established fluency in policy-speak versus the ability to bring down the rafters. At heart, is the presidential election a popularity contest? <br><br>The merits of Clinton\u2019s command of the facts are self-explanatory, while the relevance of Obama\u2019s ability to connect with audiences is less so. When I asked a friend who had stumped in New Hampshire why he had chosen to sacrifice an entire, precious day of Reading Period to Senator Obama, he responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I just find him really inspiring. Isn\u2019t that enough?\u201d More than four weeks later, I find myself wondering the exact same question. Is it enough that Barack Obama loses more policy debates than he wins, but leaves audiences roaring everywhere he goes? Will that win in November and, more importantly, will it serve us well until 2012? At the New Hampshire debate, Senator Clinton reminded America of the dangers of voting for the candidate with whom they would most like to \u201chave a beer.\u201d But the magical quality of Obama\u2019s oratory can hardly be sidelined to that of a happy hour playmate. Any diligent junior high civics student can tell you that the executive is constitutionally the weakest branch of government. But a rhetorically adept president can leverage public support to drive through groundbreaking bills that are too risky for individual legislators to try and pass on their own. In this respect, an Obama presidency might better mirror Lyndon Johnson\u2019s role in pushing through the Civil Rights Act of 1964 than the anemic gestures towards civil rights made by the Kennedy White House. Senator Obama\u2019s ability to rally the public troops\u2014call it inspiration, charisma, or even \u201cchange you can believe in\u201d\u2014seems to have touched a widespread nerve amongst Democrats of all stripes, particularly when compared with the distinctly uninspiring and combative style of his opponent. It remains to be seen, however, just how valuable the American people believe this x-factor to be contra John McCain\u2014a candidate with Hillary\u2019s foreign policy credentials and without such widespread (albeit superficial and oft-overstated) \u201cdislikeability.\u201d Painting a Purple Heart winner as \u201canti-hope,\u201d I would hazard, could present a few new challenges for the Obama spin machine. <br><br>As a highly educated, soon-to-be-yuppie emerging from the throes of e-recruiting, I ex ante believe that jobs should be rewarded to those who can establish their qualifications in a substantive, structured and tangible way\u2014namely, through policy debates. But in the end, my vote carries the same weight as that of the senior citizen concerned about losing her drug benefits to an overly ambitious tax plan, the concerned father who doesn\u2019t want his daughter to think that the only way to become president is to marry one, and the recently unemployed steel worker who just can\u2019t bring himself to vote for such a frigid you-know-what. Far from elegant (or even reasonable), the process by which we make our most important political choices is a sticky web of policy, identity, and a strong thirst for likeable leadership; our inability to gauge, much less standardize, these criteria with which we size up our options is at the same time the most beautiful and frustrating element of our electoral process. In this way, the choice between Senators Clinton and Obama represents neither a battle of the sexes, nor a clash of black versus white, but rather, an unprecedented referendum on the mechanics of our democracy.<br><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Audrey J.

And it is a phrase that starry-eyed Obama supporters like to think describes their mission.\n<br><br>The junior Senator from Illinois indeed has inspired a religious following, especially among the young and other demographics susceptible to irrational surges of idealism. Even the previously disenchanted and disenfranchised, the party establishment as well as the grass-root fringes, have heeded the altar call, and have been born again in Hope.\n<br><br>Hope\u2014a bright, if not entirely reasonable, optimism for the future, for individuals\u2019 ability to \u201ccreate change\u201d\u2014has become the rallying cry of a new generation of politics.\n<br><br>As one surveys the epicenter of this revival\u2014the college campus\u2014one clearly sees that Hope abounds. Audacity, on the other hand, is nowhere to be found. For nothing requires less courage than aping the dominant ideology at these bastions of political uniformity: this year, the year of Barack, that ideology is Hope.\n<br><br>In endorsing Obama, the Yale Daily News confidently observed that he \u201cseemed genuine\u201d: an Obama administration \u201cpromises a reassertion of the natural, American optimism\u201d and \u201cnew reforms.\u201d The force of such argument, apparently, does not require any specific examples, for \u201chope fills a depressed town.\u201d And in a town like New Haven, that is all that is needed.\n<br><br>The Daily Princetonian, likewise, joined the choir, linking Obama\u2019s \u201crelative lack of experience\u201d and \u201cnaivete in foreign affairs\u201d with his \u201cpotential for healing the divisions of the nation and moving us forward to a better day.\u201d The junior Senator \u201cpoints us toward what is possible to achieve if we can unite in common cause.\u201d His very words stir us to action, to forget the sobering reality of recent experience, to believe that anything, no matter how impossible, is possible.\n<br><br>Our own campus\u2019s paper of record, The Crimson, also could not permit silence to drown out hope. Only Barack Obama, it opined, has the \u201cvision required not only to be president, but to fundamentally alter the way our broken political system functions\u201d and a singular \u201cdesire to see dramatic change in the political system.\u201d Brimming with nostalgia for the 1970s, those halcyon years for campus radicals, The Crimson can only view the political landscape through rose-colored glasses.\n<br><br> Certainly it is understandable, if not forgivable, that college students seem particularly attracted to the promise of a better future, to \u201cchange\u201d in general, to the unlimited capacity for man\u2019s moral perfection. They read about such fancies in their social theory classes; political \u201cscience\u201d teaches how to practice them. Administrators constantly advise their charges, in vapid aphorisms, to challenge authority, to question assumptions, to follow their dreams.\n<br><br>But this outlook, which its adherents often contrast with the cynicism of their elders, cannot hope to live up to expectations. The art of politics demands prudence\u2014the rational faculty that determines, in a given situation, what is possible and practicable. Experience, habit, and keen observation help develop this faculty\u2014an unadorned albeit indomitable hope is only a lazy substitute.\n<br><br>Aristotle with good reason observed that the young man is not a proper student of politics: his temperament is too rash and his experience too slight to make consistently sound judgments about the inexact science of politics. But our society consistently spurns such warnings, exalting \u201cparticipation,\u201d and ever devising new strategies to persuade the \u201cyouth\u201d to vote. Barack Obama may have finally found one: appealing to the vanity of young age. \n<br><br>\u201cChange\u201d takes time; it requires patience, which our generation has little these days. For we live in an ever-globalizing world, where communication is instantaneous, where technology continues to erode the limitations of man\u2019s natural capacities, and where politics is now everyone\u2019s favorite reality show. \n<br><br>Barack Obama\u2019s stripe of \u201chope\u201d does not require any effort, any commitment: it demands only that close one\u2019s eyes and ears to the difficult or uncomfortable realities with which one would rather not have to bother. Immediate gratification is the ethos of our age. \n<br><br>Barack Obama is light on both substance and experience, but such issues do not give the students of elite universities any pause\u2014for his syrupy words more than satisfy their untrained and immature palates. \n<br><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Christopher B.

{"title": "Asleep at the Digital Switch | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Last Monday, members of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) came to Boston to hold hearings on an important subject: whether broadband providers like AT&amp;T, Verizon, and Comcast should be allowed to manage Internet traffic for efficiency\u2019s sake. It\u2019s a useful question, and one that abuts the controversial debate on network neutrality: the idea that broadband networks should blindly treat each bit of information on the Internet equally.  \n<br><br>To be sure, we shouldn\u2019t allow broadband providers to act in an anti-competitive fashion by discriminating against particular content\u2014for instance, blocking a Democratic blog and giving priority to a Republican website. However, most experts agree that broadband providers should be allowed to reasonably manage their networks to confront a looming threat: A relatively small set of users are downloading unprecedented volumes of video and music with \u201cpeer-to-peer\u201d software, creating an online traffic jam and slowing down connection speeds for everyone.  \n<br><br>And while this is an important debate, it\u2019s largely one for academics and engineers, who need to hammer out the details of what passes for acceptable network management. But the FCC\u2019s seemingly obsequious effort to reassure Silicon Valley special interests\u2014like Google\u2014that enough fast lanes will be preserved for their latest application is in stark contrast to the war on civil rights and diversity that the FCC has declared of late.    \n<br><br>And the reality is that the FCC will shy away from addressing these more important issues, hoping that its academic debate about network management might serve as a salve for the widespread criticism that it\u2019s asleep at the digital switch. \n<br><br>Indeed, we are today facing an ownership crisis in broadcast television.  People of color make up 33 percent of our population but own just three percent of all broadcast TV stations\u2014and research shows that the number of owners is plummeting at alarming levels. Despite repeated requests from more than 20 civil rights organizations, FCC Chairman Kevin Martin has placed the future of media diversity in greater jeopardy by asking programmers of color to take a back seat to his favored special interests.    \n<br><br>In the waning days of 2007, as the Washington political set scurried to get out of town for holiday vacations, Martin bulldozed through a dramatic relaxation of the cross-ownership rules that ensure a diversity of voices in our local media markets. Now, local media moguls can buy both a television station and the major newspaper in the local market. And because people of color and women are more likely to be single-station owners, they are especially susceptible to local consolidation efforts. \n<br><br>Indeed, in the hours preceding the FCC vote, Martin blithely acknowledged that the new rule would make it harder for people of color and women to own broadcast stations. Martin has also been the subject of widespread criticism from the civil rights community for other efforts that would hamper African-American television programmers such as a la carte pricing and his campaign to award large swaths of cable channel space to incumbent broadcasters at the potential expense of programmers of color. The civil rights community accused the FCC and its chairman of aping an \u201canti-diversity agenda.\u201d Commissioner Jonathan Adelstein likened some of the chairman\u2019s ideas to \u201cdigital sharecropping.\u201d  To put it bluntly, Martin\u2019s policies are leading us down the road to media fascism, where only one viewpoint will be heard.  \n<br><br>Martin and his ever-dwindling allies in Congress argue that this kind of government-encouraged media consolidation policy is needed to help newspapers ailing in the Internet revolution. However, instead of addressing these new challenges, the policy represents a continuation of media concentration that we have already seen in ownership in the large radio companies like Clear Channel.  \n<br><br>Congressional leaders such as Representatives John Dingell, Ed Markey, John Conyers, Marsha Blackburn and Senators John Kerry and Barack Obama have raised strong objections to they way the chairman is conducting FCC business, suggesting additional independent panels, investigations into process, and even legislation to curb the commission\u2019s powers.  \n<br><br>It is high time. The public is depending on an FCC that protects diversity and localism, that encourages a wealth of viewpoints, and that protects consumers. By this measure, the current FCC is dangerously far off track.   \n<br><br>It\u2019s all fine and good for the FCC to have dog and pony shows to respond to Silicon Valley lobbyists.  But the real business of the FCC\u2014ensuring a widespread diversity of voices on the nation\u2019s airways\u2014is under attack.  The FCC would better serve the public by staying home and attending to real business of the people. \n<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Mel King is currently the Director of the South End Technology Center @ Tent City in Boston, MA.

{"title": "Real(ity) Wisdom | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Last time I was home, I got caught up in an MTV marathon of one of my favorite TV shows: \u201cAmerica\u2019s Next Top Model.\u201d For those unfamiliar with the phenomenon that is ANTM, the show is supermodel Tyra Banks\u2019s sometimes-sadistic \u201cmodeling\u201d competition (it\u2019s judged more on personality than pictures), which professes to seek the next great model\u2014a young girl who invariably disappears after winning.\n<br><br>My mother, after observing me waste away hours every day watching cycles\u2014\u201cTop Model\u201d has cycles, not seasons (and with a dozen girls trapped in a house together for months, the menstruation jokes write themselves)\u2014asked me how I could possibly find entertainment in reality TV I\u2019d already seen. \n<br><br>Past \u201cTop Model\u201d cycles, I said, are like good mystery novels: After you know who did it, you have to read it again. Watching Cycle Four from the beginning for the umpteenth time, I could look for clues to reveal how Naima went from being the quiet, faux-hawked dancer no one seemed to notice to Top Model. (Incidentally, she recently had to quit a waitressing job because she got recognized too often while pouring her customers\u2019 coffee. Sad.)\n<br><br>Naima\u2019s was a familiar course to victory: Along with Naima, Yoanna (Cycle Two), Nicole (Cycle Five), and Danielle (Cycle Six) were all upper-middle of the pack contestants who survived well into the season before rising to the top as their more boisterous and inconsistent competitors fell by the wayside. The same has happened in the biggest reality competition of all time: American Idol. Kelly Clarkson, winner of American Idol\u2019s first season, and Jordin Sparks, winner of the last, both followed the narratives of non-frontrunners who broke out big near the end.\n<br><br>Watching these shows imparts a valuable lesson about decoding and participating in a social world: We all are constantly creating narratives for ourselves. Steven Berlin Johnson observed the cognitive value of reality TV in his book Everything Bad is Good For You: \u201cAs each show discloses its rules and conventions, and each participant reveals his or her personality traits and background, the intrigue in watching comes from figuring out how the participants should best navigate the environment that\u2019s been created for them.\u201d Watch closely, watch often, and patterns start to emerge.\n<br><br>But the benefits of shows like \u201cTop Model\u201d and \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d (and lots of others, from Survivor to Project Runway) offer more than just the flexing of our cognitive muscles. They teach us lessons about which kind of narratives are successful\u2014and which aren\u2019t. Successful narratives include the under-the-radar talent (like the girls described above), the obnoxious enfant terrible who eventually softens (Eva on \u201cTop Model\u201d Cycle Three, Christian on this season\u2019s \u201cProject Runway\u201d), and the early star who falls only to rise again (CariDee, \u201cTop Model\u201d Cycle Seven). And we begin to see these patterns not only on TV, but also in politics, in the workplace, and even in the classroom.\n<br><br>I\u2019ve spotted a few trends watching these shows over and over (and over) about what narratives don\u2019t work: First, the early frontrunners never live up to expectations in the end. Melinda Doolittle, third-place finisher on \u201cIdol\u201d Season Six, was so talented that the judges began referring to her as the competition\u2019s \u201cconsummate pro.\u201d \u201cConsummate pro\u201d doesn\u2019t quite make for an appealing Cinderella story, nor is it ever possible to live up to great early performances; she was eventually beaten by Jordin Sparks, for whom expectations were lower. Melinda Doolittle is an awful lot like Hillary Clinton, the long-assumed eventual winner who flirts dangerously with staleness as an upstart gathers momentum.\n<br><br>Second, the biggest personalities can\u2019t win. Jade (\u201cTop Model\u201d Cycle Six), Melrose (Cycle Seven), and Brittany (Cycle Four) were incredibly entertaining in their insanity and/or obnoxiousness, and so they stayed around until the end: They made for good TV. But Tyra was never going to make Jade\u2014she who spewed crocodile tears in front of the panel and made up words like \u201ctornness\u201d when describing her emotional ambivalence\u2014a CoverGirl. Much the same, our grandparents in Florida were never going to vote to make a man who takes a cell-phone call from his wife while giving a speech in front of the National Rifle Association their nominee for president. If only Giuliani had watched Cycle Six.\n<br><br>And these lessons apply far beyond political races. Even here at Harvard we constantly cultivate narratives. When I start doing work for a new class, I struggle to balance working too hard (I don\u2019t want to set expectations too high for my future work) with slacking off (I want to make a good first impression). I want to participate, but not too much\u2014I\u2019ll save my best comments for the end of section, so they stick in my TF\u2019s mind as she ruminates over her grading book.\n<br><br>Of course I don\u2019t calculate this coldly\u2014and neither do the contestants on reality shows\u2014but we live in a world that both Shakespeare and sociologist Erving Goffman compared to a theatrical stage. When we are all acting through life, figuring out what roles are likely to thrive is central to achieving success. And reality shows offer dozens of controlled experiments in narrative creation. Their outcomes provide troves of data to help us end up as Horatios instead of Hamlets, McCains instead of Giulianis, Jordins instead of Melindas.\n<br><br>Also, they\u2019re fun to watch.

{"title": "No We Can\u2019t! | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Senator Hillary Clinton recently has taken to scolding Senator Barack Obama for being all talk and no action.\r<br><br>Swap Obama\u2019s speech for his position paper, however, and you\u2019ll see he does offer specifics\u2014lots of them. On top of $210 billion in new government spending, Obama promises to shackle U.S. businesses with heavy regulation. If he becomes president, he\u2019ll do more than bring change: he\u2019ll force Americans into an economic straitjacket. \r<br><br>To \u201crebuild the middle class,\u201d Obama will resuscitate labor unions with the Employee Free Choice Act. It would allow a union to represent employees without holding a secret-ballot election. Once the union garnered a majority of employees\u2019 signatures on authorization cards, it would automatically become their bargaining agent. Sounds like a free choice\u2014until a Teamster is staring you in the face with a pen in hand. \r<br><br>Stronger unions would force companies to pay more, but that money has to come from somewhere. Cut profit, and shareholders take the hit. Raise prices, and consumers foot the bill. Cut costs, and companies may be forced to fire the very workers that unions are supposed to protect.\r<br><br>The United Auto Workers union, for example, has crippled Detroit automakers with high labor costs. Now, workers are feeling the pain. Chrysler LLC plans to lay off 12,000 workers this year after cutting 13,000 jobs last year. Americans are wary of unions for good reason. \r<br><br>After shooing workers into Big Labor\u2019s arms, Obama will shame businesses with the Patriot Employer Act. It offers a one percent tax credit to companies, but under a heap of conditions, including a pension plan that matches five percent of worker contributions for every employee and payment of 60 percent of each worker\u2019s healthcare premiums. \r<br><br>Worst of all, businesses\u2019 foreign divisions will have to pay the U.S. corporate tax rate, instead of their host countries\u2019 rates. At 35 percent, our corporate tax rate is the second highest in the developed world, so companies would suffer a tax increase. And no, they don\u2019t deserve one. In 2005, the National Bureau of Economic Research found that when U.S. companies take on more foreign workers, they tend to hire more American workers as well.\r<br><br>Everyone benefits from the lower prices that result from companies moving overseas. Globalization doesn\u2019t hit only the U.S. either. This year, some 10,000 Chinese factories are expected to relocate to cheaper spots like Indonesia and Vietnam. We won\u2019t complain when laptop prices drop.\r<br><br>Still, Obama hopes to revise the North American Free Trade Agreement, his most perplexing proposal yet. He wants to impose labor and environmental standards on Canadian and Mexican companies, so U.S. companies face \u201cfair\u201d competition.\r<br><br>Such standards, however, impede competition. The free market allows companies that provide better goods at cheaper prices to make greater profits. If foreign competitors slap arbitrary standards on them that raise their costs, then competition stumbles, prices rise, and Americans suffer the fallout.\r<br><br>It\u2019ll also be curious to see how Obama tries to strong-arm our two largest export markets into blunting their competitive edge, especially after he\u2019s pledged to meet some of the world\u2019s worst dictators without preconditions.\r<br><br>Obama isn\u2019t all talk; his policy positions fill reams of paper. If he takes the oath of office in January, he\u2019ll drown U.S. businesses in regulations and they\u2019ll be less competitive in the world economy. Sure, he\u2019s inspiring. But our troubled economy can\u2019t afford the left-wing policies beneath the veneer.\r<br><br>Senator Obama claims to be a fresh face in the political arena, but rip away the glamour and the glitz, and you\u2019ll find he\u2019s nothing more than a big-government liberal.\r<br><br> <br><br>Brian J.

{"title": "Generation Change | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>When I came to the United States in 1994, change for me as a nine-year-old child was simply relief from the uncertainty of whether I was going to live or going to die that existed in my country of residence in Burundi and in my native country of Rwanda. The opportunity to grow up in an environment in which my life was not in perpetual jeopardy was a welcome change, but I quickly learned that the privilege of a secure environment is not to be idle but rather to actively work at being the change that one desires to see in the world.  I began to speak up on issues related to the continent of Africa and to share with students my age at such universities as Harvard, Yale and Stanford about what our generation should learn from the Rwanda experience. <br><br>While working to give a voice to the people of Africa, I have met various people along the journey that were unforgettable, one being Senator Barack Obama. I met him at a conference at Saddleback Church as he spoke along side Senator Sam Brownback on the bi-partisan efforts of the Senate in helping the continent of Africa in the fight against HIV/Aids.  <br><br>After that first meeting, I thought that Senator Obama would be a great candidate for the presidency if he ever ran. And, as you can imagine, I was delighted when I saw on the news a couple of months later that he was launching his bid for the presidency.  I intend to cast my vote for Senator Barack Obama if he wins the nomination for the Democratic party and my reasons have less to do with his eloquence on the campaign trail or his African heritage, than with his willingness not simply to talk the talk, but walk the walk when it comes to ensuring the human rights of Africans. Historically, African human rights is an issue that western leaders have been unconscionably reluctant to back up with real action. But Barack Obama, has demonstrated tremendous leadership time and time again by backing up his great speeches with even greater actions.  <br><br>There is no country in the world that has had to endure a more gruesome aftermath of a total breakdown in leadership than Rwanda. In 1994, Rwanda suffered a tragedy unimaginable in both scope and brutality. It was the fastest genocide in recorded history.  An estimated 800,000 to one million innocent civilians were killed in a span of one hundred days, and hundreds of thousands fell victim to displacement and starvation in the following weeks and months. The international community\u2019s failure to act, in spite of the fact that the whole world was aware of the atrocities taking place, is one of the most shameful facts of the twentieth century. <br><br>Yet, we have once again witnessed failure of leadership to act in regards to genocide in Darfur\u2014with the exception of Senator Obama, who has been on the forefront not just with his words but with his actions.  He has co-sponsored six bills to help fight the genocide in Darfur, including the Darfur Accountability Act, the Darfur Peace and Accountability Act, and the Sudan Divestment Authorization Act.<br><br>Obama\u2019s demonstrated commitment to ending genocide in Darfur is an example of what we, the foot soldiers of Obama\u2019s historic march to the presidency, call the politics of change. Our generation is calling for an end to the status quo, not just in the way we view politics, but also in the way that we conceive of poverty, disease, genocide, climate change and how these complex issues are woven together.  We see the evidence of this in how our generation is embracing the fight against AIDS and poverty with Bono, climate change with Al Gore, and demanding an end to the divisive and stagnant politics that made us unwilling to act against genocide in Rwanda in 1994 or in Darfur today. <br><br>An astonishing number of young people are coming out in support of the junior Senator of Illinois as he has spoken for the need to change the trajectory of the country and begin moving in a new direction.  Something rare is happening in America where young people are not merely looking to one person to initiate change, but more and more they are looking at one another as change agents who have a mutual responsibility to make this world a better place. The strength of the Obama movement among young people even has ripple effects among their parents.  Two examples are of influential women, Caroline Kennedy and Senator Claire McCaskill, who have spoken about the enthusiasm of their children as the motivating factor that caused them to get behind Senator Obama\u2019s bid for the presidency.  <br><br>This is in no small part thanks to Senator Obama\u2019s inclusive rhetoric on the campaign trail that employs phrases like \u201cYes we can,\u201d which lend a strong sense of community to a movement that is gearing itself towards change. Obama has brought together a diverse coalition of people from different backgrounds with the promise of reaching across partisan divides and barriers of race. <br><br>Obama\u2019s contagious enthusiasm for political change has empowered our generation not to settle for business as usual, but rather to be the change that we desire to see in our world.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Paul N.

{"title": "TALK TO US! | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The complaint is as old as Harvard: Administrators make decisions about student life without engaging students. And students respond, often rightfully, that the decisions are out-of-touch with reality (e.g. booze) or just crazy (e.g. the Library Building at 90 Mt. Auburn).  \n<br><br>I write today with a slightly different complaint about the decision to institute women\u2019s only hours at the Quadrangle Recreational Athletic Center (QRAC). I find fault not with the decision\u2014it was a good one\u2014but with the fact that a small clique of administrators made the decision, once again, with little input from anyone else. In doing so, they deprived the Harvard community of an opportunity to improve itself through the discussion of an issue that will follow us long after we leave Cambridge. \n<br><br>The controversy surrounding women\u2019s only hours, which Fox News and the Associated Press have made national news, stems from its source: Muslim women who requested these hours because they must be fully clothed if men are exercising alongside them. If students need education and real-life experience with any civic issue\u2014the supposed goal of our revitalized curriculum\u2014it is this: the politics of multiculturalism and how America will deal with its changing ethnic and religious makeup.\n<br><br>And yet student discussion was not organized in January when Susan Marine, Director of the Harvard College Women\u2019s Center, Paul J. McLoughlin, Assistant Dean of Harvard College, and Jeremy L. Gibson, Associate Director of Athletics, met to decide how best to deal with these requests. According to Marine and McLoughlin, the absence of dialogue was not an accident. \n<br><br>Both were motivated by the kindest intentions in keeping the decision to themselves: protecting the Muslim students from hurtful comments. Nevertheless, by remaining secretive they not only engendered anger among students who were surprised by the decision, but also missed a perfect educational opportunity to improve community awareness and sensitivity. \n<br><br>It is impossible to know which side wins in a cost-benefit analysis: \u201cMight the Muslim students\u2019 discomfort outweigh the educational benefits?\u201d is an argument with which I sympathize. I am skeptical, however, that discomfort can ever be avoided when dealing with tensions of privileges, exclusion, and religion; these issues are controversial <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">because of </span>their public nature\u2014in how they infringe on the privileges of some in order to benefit others\u2014and the administration\u2019s attempt to sidetrack controversy only created more of it. \n<br><br>In my ideal Harvard, McLoughlin and the rest of University Hall would have organized House-based discussions in which the Muslim women live. Although the logistics would have been more complicated, the benefits of holding such discussions on a House-by-House basis, each of which has its own gym, are numerous. \n<br><br>On a practical level, many of the students who are supposed to gain from the hours live in Mather and Leverett and are unable to use the QRAC at 8 a.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Very few women have used the gym so far because of the inconvenience, not due to a lack of desire. \n<br><br>More importantly,  these House forums would have fostered discussion about this delicate and crucial issue; would have given students a chance to talk face-to-face with their Housemates about their personal concerns; and would have provided students with a forum to argue the merits and demerits of the issue. \n<br><br>Maybe I am placing too much faith in the power of community debate\u2014blame Social Studies 10. The fact remains that multiculturalism and religious rights are vital issues to all Harvard students, and discussion remains the backbone of any education. If House Committees had added this to their agendas and University Hall paid for advertisements and pizzas, students would have come out and talked, which is the only way that acceptance improves. \n<br><br>Even in the worst-case scenario\u2014a student voicing cruel judgments\u2014another student standing up to the jeerer would be an invaluable statement of support, as would the likely conclusion of the meeting: a House Committee\u2019s democratic vote to allow Muslim women to use its gym exclusively each week. \n<br><br>Harvard students can whip off sneering e-mails about women they do not know, but it is much harder to insult people to their face once they have been identified as members of your House and have publicly expressed their personal concerns. It is hard for me to believe that Matherites would have stood up and disparaged a peer who just asked for a few hours of special access to the community\u2019s gym.\n<br><br>I may be na\u00efve to expect community dialogue to improve religious tensions, or even to expect people to care about the dialogue itself. But why not use this little Garden of ours as an experiment? Administrators like to think of Harvard as something different from the real world\u2014a place in which University Hall acts as a special guard that \u201cprotects\u201d students. \n<br><br>We should try a different experiment in which students actually have responsibility in making major decisions that concern their daily lives. If this community is ever going to be liberal (liberal in the democratic-acceptance-sense rather than the I-Heart-Barack-Obama-sense), silence on multiculturalism and backdoor decisions will get us nowhere. By experimenting with community forums in which students are able to give up their privileges\u2014rather than have administrators take them away\u2014we would be living up to what Harvard hopes to be. We don\u2019t need Habermas to teach us that.\n<br><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Andrew D.

{"title": "The Passion of Idiots | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>You may have noticed: There are some people on this campus who like to complain. They whine, they cry, they spam the open lists; in every discussion, Lacoste-sporting Harvard undergraduates form up into a bourgeois proletariat, for whom angry emails have replaced manifestos.  They are defiantly, eternally dissatisfied\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter why\u2014and many spend their hours insisting upon an urgent need for some type of \u201cchange\u201d; though, again, they never take the unattractive step of defining what that change means. It\u2019s like a Barack Obama speech without the eloquence\u2014but with all the mind-numbing, fanfare and self-importance.\r\n<br><br>Then there are those who complain about the complainers.\r\n<br><br>They are the ones who roll their eyes with that cynical smirk, have a witty retort prepared for any gripe that comes their way, and never fail to note their privileged perspective of the self-indulgence and egomania of us Harvard students (excluding themselves). They direct their patronizing misanthropy at campus \u201cbrats,\u201d and come out looking somehow worse\u2014brattier\u2014than their targets.\r\n<br><br>At a school with so many smart, talented, and well-rounded people, it is astounding that our public discourse is dominated by two groups that are so markedly shortsighted, erratic, and, plainly, full of it. Indeed, there is no better example of this unhappy reality than the current uproar over changes in dining hall menu. During the past month, Harvard University Dining Services (HUDS) has been decreasing the number and variety of its meal offerings. They blame the change on increasing food prices\u2014which of course, like any budget-based argument at Harvard, seems not to convince many.\r\n<br><br>But the current discussion, if one is willing to call it that, has completely failed to address this matter sensibly, instead devolving into mean-spirited accusations and general disarray. Thoughtless rancor has driven students to argue that it is HUDS who is at fault here, and that the managers and workers are simply lazy or corrupt. On house e-mail lists, some have even gone so far as to attack specific dining-hall employees. All this bickering directed at middlemen ignores the fact of its futility and carries on, instead of discussing solutions to the actual problem, like more flexible meal plans.\r\n<br><br>Nevertheless, there is an underlying sentiment in these lamentations\u2014however awfully distorted and misdirected\u2014with which one can sympathize, something completely absent amongst the counter-complainers, who are no less obnoxious.  Where were they\u2013given their claims of moral superiority and wisdom\u2014when Harvard lost over 350 million dollars in a hedge fund last year? Or when the administration breached its contract with its workers? Of course, they were too jaded to care. For these people, it seems that it\u2019s the feeling of superiority over their classmates that matters, not actually considering anyone\u2019s wellbeing. And who can blame them? It\u2019s not as if they have to pay their way through college or anything. Now they can go to Chipotle and inveigh against the world over a six-dollar burrito.\r\n<br><br>And so the passionate, purposeless quarreling continues while the underlying issues go unaddressed. It goes to show that, when it comes down to it, it\u2019s not overcoming problems that counts\u2014it\u2019s the opportunity to bemoan them to anyone who\u2019ll listen. Thus, we should see this moment as a chance for change. Can\u2019t we at least begin complaining about complaining about complaining?\r\n<br><br>I\u2019ll start writing the e-mail now.\r\n<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Sahand Moarefy \u201910, a Crimson business editor, is an economics concentrator in Mather House.</span></span></p>"}
{"title": "The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Late last month, presidential hopeful Mike Gravel came to campus to deliver a talk sponsored by the Harvard College Democrats. A former senator from Alaska and current YouTube superstar, Gravel hopes to bring the power back to the people. FM caught up with the Massachusetts native in Sever Hall, where he discussed everything from his presidential goals to his rap skills. <br><br><br>1. <br>Fifteen Minutes (FM): What\u2019s changed in politics in general since you left office 30 years ago? <br>Mike Gravel (MG): We\u2019re coming off an area of conservatism, of selfishness, of individualism, and maybe we\u2019re moving towards a more cooperative approach in society. I hope that\u2019s the case, because certainly when you look at the environmental problem we face, it\u2019s very serious. In fact unless we make some fundamental changes we\u2019re going to cook ourselves off the planet in the next hundred years. And that problem can only be addressed cooperatively. Our individualism, our libertarianism, our republican selfishness is not serving us well in terms of human governance. <br><br>2. <br>FM: How would you compare the level of youth activism now to when you were in the Senate? <br>MG: Probably it was more shrill when I was last in office because we were at the height of the Vietnam War. It had just been completed. The youth had really taken to the streets because of what the amount of death and what the country was doing. After the conservative revolution with Ronald Reagan, it almost seemed like the youth went to sleep or focused on a new area of interest. <br><br>3. <br>FM: Are you disappointed with this new political apathy? <br>MG: The youth have never, never been a large voting bloc, and there are reasons for that. They don\u2019t get to have a full stake in society and they\u2019re not motivated like people who have a stake. Whether you have a house, a job, or the loss of a job, it changes your whole approach. Jack Kennedy with his charisma certainly did bring out idealism in youth, and of course Hubert Humphrey probably in greater detail than did Jack Kennedy. We don\u2019t have that situation right now. Where are the young people in that regard? I don\u2019t think that they\u2019re any different than the older people. <br><br>4. <br>FM: What\u2019s the most important thing for college students to know about your campaign? <br>MG: The fact that I\u2019m the first one in American history that is campaigning on the basis of \u201cFine, I don\u2019t mind being president.\u201d I don\u2019t have a burning desire to be president, but if I were president I would be a very unusual one. The most important thing is I want to empower the American people to become lawmakers. Even if I became president and the people weren\u2019t able to make laws, I would not continue to be president. <br><br>5. <br>FM: If you do make it to the White House, what should we expect? <br>MG: I would use the office to bully the American people to empower themselves to make fundamental changes. Only the people can do this. The Congress can\u2019t do this. The Congress won\u2019t buy into changing the tax code and making it really fair. The Congress won\u2019t stop the whole military-industrial complex being the top priority of the economy. The Congress won\u2019t do that. The people would, if the people have the power. If they chose not to do that, I would not continue to be president because I couldn\u2019t accomplish anything. <br><br>6. <br>FM: Seriously? <br>MG: That\u2019s what is important and that\u2019s what\u2019s really unique about my campaign. Never in the history of the nation has a person put himself up and said, \u201cLook, sure I want to be your leader, but I don\u2019t want to be your leader unless I\u2019m your legislative leader and you have the power to make laws.\u201d If the people can\u2019t make laws, then I don\u2019t want the job. <br><br>7. <br>FM: You have some lofty gals like eliminating the IRS and decriminalizing marijuana. Is the country ready for such radical change? <br>MG: Of course it is. I know of at least five blind polls where people pick issues that they think that they want to accomplish. And you know something? The candidate that they most identify with is me. I dwarf Hilary and Obama in these blind polls. What are the people saying? If they knew who I was attached to the issues that they want to see resolved, then I would become president of the United States. But I don\u2019t have the 50 million that Obama has or the 30 million that Hilary raised this last 30 days. All I have is the $300,000 that I raised over the last year and a half. The democratic leadership is afraid of me. That\u2019s why they have wiped out my voice. <br><br>8. <br>FM: What do you hope to accomplish staying in the race for so long? <br>MG: To show people that there is a way. See, the people overwhelmingly show in the polls that they want to be in power. They\u2019ve got to recognize that the central power of government is lawmaking, so they\u2019ve got to become lawmakers. And how can they do that? I have a website called The National Initiative where they can begin to be informed. This is out of the box. It\u2019s very difficult for people to understand this, so it\u2019s going to take an educational process. And that\u2019s what I hope my campaign is doing. Repeating over and over again that the answer is not electing people to office. The answer primarily is to empower the American people to share legislative power with elected officials. <br><br>9. <br>FM: What\u2019s your strategy to get more national attention now that the media is focusing only on Clinton and Obama? <br>MG: First off, I have to overcome getting shut out by corporate America and the Democratic leadership that did not want my voice to be heard. Now that the process has winnowed down where it\u2019s just Obama and Hilary on the Democratic side, then I\u2019m still a candidate. So maybe now that we\u2019ve got a lot of these people out of the way, they\u2019ll have to come. People are getting fed up with the same old Hilary and Obama stuff. People are getting tired of that. So the media is going to want to make things a little interesting. They may reach down and say well what\u2019s this Gravel all about? Because they can\u2019t make fun of me. My record of accomplishments is too significant. My record of accomplishments dwarfs anything that Hilary or Obama would ever even think of doing. So they\u2019ve got to give me my due, and as my due is given to me I can get my message out. When the people realize what I\u2019m talking about. <br><br>10. <br>FM: Why come to Harvard? <br>MG: I came to Harvard when I was in the Senate and I was just tickled to death. Secondly, Harvard is a global institution, recognized as one of the fountains of knowledge. To not take the opportunity to come to Harvard when you\u2019re invited is just the epitome of ignorance. <br><br>11. <br>FM: In one of your popular YouTube videos, you performed a rap about the campaign. Do you think you could freestyle a little right now? <br>MG: To tell you the truth I can\u2019t. I do it under the direction. <br><br>12. <br>FM: Do you write your own lyrics at least? <br>MG: All of what you see on YouTube is these young people who have gotten involved in getting committed to my campaign and are telling me what to do. Now when it comes to policy, I don\u2019t need them to tell me what to do, I know what I want to do as president. I\u2019m doing another [video] in New York tomorrow. And that was with the fellow who is the producer of U2. Well I know that that\u2019s a band but he wants to see if he can\u2019t help make me known. That\u2019s very exciting for me, but they want me to sing a song. But I don\u2019t know how to sing a song. They\u2019re weaving this into a video and they\u2019re using it so it\u2019s their creativity. <br><br>13. <br>FM: Was it difficult for you to embrace unconventional campaign tactics like YouTube? <br>MG: It\u2019s a little bit like when you see a 30-second spot, the candidate didn\u2019t do this. Some person of great talent did this. And they use the candidate to get this message across. Well that\u2019s what these young people are trying to do. They bought into my message and they\u2019re trying to help me sell my message because we don\u2019t have any money to sell my message. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m running, is to get the message out. So I go along with them on it. If it means humor, if it means singing, I\u2019ll do whatever they think as long as it\u2019s dignified. And I believe in humor. I have a very good sense of humor. <br><br>14. <br>FM: What\u2019s your plan going forward? <br>MG: I want to continue to campaign in the primary, and I hope I can get a delegate or two. If I do, I\u2019ll show up with my delegate, and I\u2019ll try to make a speech at the convention, and if I do I\u2019ll point out the Democratic party leadership was the one that silenced my voice. Is that the Democratic Party that I bought into as a young man? Hell no. And that should be pointed out. <br><br>15. <br>FM: And if you don\u2019t get a delegate? <br>MG: If there are other parties that want me to run on their ticket, then I\u2019d be happy to do it. I want to stay in until the very end. Until November.</span></p>"}
{"title": "The Clear Choice | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Barack Obama has racked up a string of primary victories since Super Tuesday last month, prompting many both within the Obama camp and across the country to all but declare him the Democratic nominee. Similarly, Hillary Clinton\u2019s lack of victories over the past four weeks have led many to characterize her campaign as losing hope\u2014even though her campaign issued a signed statement to the contrary. Yet even in the face of these criticisms, Clinton\u2019s recent triumphs in Texas and Ohio last week, as well as Rhode Island have both revived her campaign and cemented her position as the best candidate for the Democratic nomination. <br><br>While Obama\u2019s 13-primary winning streak sounds quite impressive on the surface, a closer look reveals that many of these states will be insignificant come the general election. Seven of his victories, including the delegate-rich Virginia, have come in states that haven\u2019t voted for the Democratic candidate since 1964. Two more\u2014Alabama and South Carolina\u2014haven\u2019t gone blue since 1980. Thus, while Obama\u2019s victories in these states are impressive, the likelihood that he can capture any of these votes in November\u2019s general election is unlikely. <br><br>Contrast Obama\u2019s primary victories with Clinton\u2019s, and the viability of her candidacy is apparent. Of the eight most populous states, Hillary has won six and is leading in the polls in a seventh, Pennsylvania, which has yet to cast its vote. Among these is Florida, a crucial swing state which she won by nearly 20 points, scoring a huge advantage among critical Hispanic voters. While Obama\u2019s camp has claimed that Florida had been stripped of its delegates thus causing many voters to stay home, the fact remains that neither candidate campaigned in the state\u2014yet Hillary still won big. The suggestion by the Obama campaign that hordes of his supporters failed to go to the polls while Clinton voters flocked to vote is both irrational and disrespectful. <br><br>Hillary has also been victorious in a number of other, critical states such as Ohio, New Hampshire, and New Mexico. Additionally, she has rallied the support of important swing voting groups such as Hispanics, whereas Obama\u2019s support has come largely from traditional democratic voting blocs such as students and blacks. Though the presence of young voters and blacks has increased in this election, they cannot be counted upon in the general election, having failed to vote en masse in the past. While Obama has garnered an impressive number of victories\u2014albeit mostly in traditionally red states\u2014Clinton has continually outpaced him in both Democratic strongholds and critical swing states by garnering the support of crucial voting groups that the Democrats need to win in November. <br><br>As the Democratic National Convention in August approaches, it appears highly unlikely that either candidate will amass the number of pledged delegates needed to secure the nomination. The decision, it seems, will ultimately come down to the 796 Democratic \u201csuperdelegates,\u201d a group of elected officials and party leaders who are free to vote for whichever candidate they think is best suited for the nomination. Many are claiming that these superdelegates should vote for whichever candidate has the majority of the popular vote, but this is not a legitimate method to determine the nomination. Although Barack Obama appears to have the popular vote lead, this number is skewed since the votes in Florida and Michigan\u2014both of which were won by Clinton\u2014are being discounted. According to the National Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) Election Unit, if these votes came into play, the two candidates would be essentially tied in their vote tallies\u2014with about 47 percent of states for each candidate\u2014discounting the argument that Obama is the people\u2019s choice. <br><br>A recent poll by The New York Times found that 57 percent of registered voters felt that Clinton was prepared to be president, versus 39 percent for Obama. Discrepencies like this and Hillary\u2019s victories in almost all of the significant Democratic states cannot be ignored. Barack Obama has run a good, competitive campaign, but in the end the Democratic Party needs to select the candidate most likely to win come November\u2014not just the candidate who has managed to win Republican strongholds. The role of the superdelegates is to select that candidate, and their choice should be clear. Hillary Clinton has absorbed everything the media and the Obama campaign has thrown at her and still come out on top in nearly every battleground state. The Democrats should nominate Clinton not only because she has won these states, but also because she can win them again in the general election. <br><br><em>Peter W.

{"title": "Sorry, Mom | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>This time last week, I got into the most vicious fight I\u2019ve ever had with my mother. We were screaming over the phone so loudly my roommate hid in her room, traumatized by that special exchange of profanities that only a mother and daughter can share. <br><br>What were we yelling about? The fact that I\u2019m a senior and still unemployed? Nope. That lofty charge on my credit card for a store called \u201cLiquor World?\u201d Nope. <br><br>The verbal altercation centered around my vote for Barack Obama. <br><br>Like many women in her generation, my mom is adamant about getting Hillary Clinton into the White House. She can\u2019t understand why a self-described feminist (that would be me) would go with Obama, the seemingly inexperienced, albeit charming, senator from Illinois. <br><br>In fact, she finds it unconscionable\u2014as if I am a traitor to all women. The crux of her argument rests upon my alleged inability to understand the plight of women as it stood a generation ago. According to her, I am morally obligated to vote for Hillary. <br><br>And yet, I cast my vote for Obama. As these two candidates appear destined for months of battle for delegates and superdelegates, I\u2019m standing behind my candidate of choice (who just so happens to be a man). <br><br>As political pundits don\u2019t tire of noting, Hillary is in the awkward position of being \u201cThe Man\u201d when compared to Obama. The cost of crafting an image founded on the premise of experience (both as First Lady and as a Senator) is the appearance as the consummate Washington D.C. insider. <br><br>As polls have proved, a lot of voters within my generation are sick and tired of the hierarchy working within D.C. While her candidacy is revolutionary in the historical sense, from a contemporary perspective Hillary personifies that establishment that we don\u2019t want around anymore. <br><br>The Clinton camp certainly never wagered that Obama would put up such a strong fight. In fact, it looks like America\u2019s favorite presidential couple from the 1990s is miffed that they didn\u2019t resonate as much with college students reared during their time on Pennsylvania Avenue. <br><br>After all, wasn\u2019t Bill Clinton one of the most enduring public figures of our time? After the Bush administration, wasn\u2019t he vindicated? Considering that the ex-president is locked away in the bunker usually reserved for Dick Cheney, I guess everything has an expiration date. <br><br>Such is the sense of insulted entitlement that has emanated from the Clinton campaign in the days leading up to that infamous \u201c3 A.M.\u201d ad (fear-mongering much?). Hillary\u2019s recent remarks hinting at a joint ticket\u2014with her on top, of course\u2014further indicate the candidate\u2019s conviction that the presidency is her prerogative. <br><br>Ultimately, I voted for Obama because he\u2019s the candidate with whom I identify most. And though my mom calls me a traitor I\u2019m going to stick it out with Obama. <br><br>To be honest, I do feel a little guilty about not supporting the first woman with a legitimate chance of becoming the most powerful person in the world. But if I were to vote for Hillary Clinton solely on the basis of her gender, is that really a vote of confidence for the feminist movement? In fact, it\u2019s reverse discrimination\u2014a problematic solution to a serious problem. <br><br>Regardless of the outcome of the primary, Hillary\u2019s political career will remain intact. Should she win, I\u2019d gladly vote for her over Grandpa McCain. On the other hand, if she does cede the nomination to Obama, she\u2019ll obviously remain a prominent figure within the Democratic Party, and an icon to many American women. <br><br>Plus, I hear the governor\u2019s mansion in New York might just open up.<br><br><em>Jessica C.

{"title": "States of Justice By Election | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>You\u2019ve probably noticed. In the months since the start of primary season, America has found itself riveted to presidential polls and caucus results\u2014nearly every news program dedicates at least a few minutes to chattering about Clinton, Obama or McCain.  However, as 2008 flies by, there is more at stake than the White House.  Many of America\u2019s senators, sheriffs, and railroad commissioners are also vying for their jobs.  And in Texas, Alabama, Louisiana, and West Virginia, elective justice seats on the state Supreme Court are being decided as well.\r\n<br><br>Unlike the federal court, these state-level judicial bodies rely on fully funded partisan elections to decide membership, instead of executive appointment. Single-issue watchgroups such as Texans for Public Justice and the Louisiana Organization for Judicial Excellence have coalesced around this contentious process, directing their attention at campaign financing in particular.\r\n<br><br>As always, donations do play a role in funding judges\u2019 campaigns.  All too frequently, however, judicial candidates will receive contributions from firms or  attorneys who will potentially present cases, or at least play a role, in their prospective courtrooms.  Of course, this eventuality would constitute a blatant conflict of interest, and tarnish any presumed objectivity in the judge. Worse, this unfortunate effect is not a matter of speculation, but a reality attested to by many in the justice system: According to a 1999 report, 48 percent of Texas judges and 79 percent of Texas attorneys think that campaign contributions have a \u201csignificant\u201d impact on courtroom decisions.\r\n<br><br>These highest state courts are meant to be bastions of political and social order.  They function as an essential, stable check on the state\u2019s other governmental institutions, themselves self-interested and beholden to popular opinion\u2014the legislature and the governor\u2019s office.  Both of these institutions face one undying concern\u2014re-election\u2014which influences their decisions. And rightly so: these institutions are meant to reflect the interests of their constituencies.  \r\n<br><br>However, the courts serve a different role\u2014that of justice.  Justice sometimes calls for protecting the minority against the majority, for the unpopular decision. Where an electoral system is in place, this function of the judiciary is undermined further. Prospective justices have to embrace platform issues, such as \u201cethics reform,\u201d in order to market themselves to voters. Apparently, voters respond well to \u201ctough\u201d judges, which sheds some light on Texas\u2019s 26 criminal executions this past year. (No other state executed more than three people, leading The New York Times to deem Texas \u201cThe State Without Pity.\u201d)\r\n<br><br>This sorry situation calls for immediate reform. It\u2019s atrocious that this web of interests affecting Supreme Court Justices at the state level has been allowed to persist anywhere up to the present day.  How can we ever seek justice when its arbiters and their opinions are decided unjustly?\r\n<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Rebecca A.

{"title": "Seeing America Through The Wire | Arts | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>What words can I write to mark the passing of \u201cThe Wire?\u201d I could tell you that it\u2019s my favorite television show of all time. (It is.) I could tell you that it\u2019s the best television show ever made. (I think so, and many critics agree.) I could even tell you that it\u2019s not merely a TV show; it\u2019s a potential political force that, if it ever finds a broad enough viewership, would have the power to change the fabric of this entire country. (Ask Barack Obama\u2014more on that in a minute.) All I can tell you with certainty about \u201cThe Wire,\u201d though, is that it\u2019s simply wonderful. It is a work of art. And especially at Harvard, where so many of us are concerned with the inequalities and injustices that plague these United States, it\u2019s the most important show you\u2019re probably not watching.<br><br>\u201cThe Wire,\u201d for the uninitiated, is HBO\u2019s magnificent drama series about the city of Baltimore. Don\u2019t worry if you\u2019re among the uninitiated; the show has been criminally underwatched, especially throughout its final season, and it\u2019s been consistently ignored by the Emmys. Over its five seasons, \u201cThe Wire\u201d was structured something like an archery target: the bullseye, introduced in the first season, was a group of cops and a group of drug dealers, both fascinating and flawed. One hunts the other; the other hunts itself. <br>As each season progressed, creator David Simon and his writing staff added another circle around the initial center while managing to keep most of the previous seasons\u2019 characters. Season two tackled both the ports where drugs are offloaded and the decline of the American middle class. Season three was a polemic against the war on drugs combined with an incisive view of the internal workings of politics. Season four examined the crumbling schools and the children who No Child Left Behind leaves behind. And season five, which ended Sunday night, wrapped up the series with a penetrating look at the death of honest journalism. <br><br>Looking at all these contentious issues, it\u2019s understandable that a novice might be a little afraid of watching \u201cThe Wire.\u201d The truly amazing thing about the show, however, is that it brings forth all of these issues through dynamic, involving, and often genuinely funny characters. The ostensible protagonist of \u201cThe Wire\u201d is idealistic cop Jimmy McNulty (Dominic West), but speaking only of McNulty does a disservice to the show\u2019s remarkable ensemble of brilliant detectives, cunning drug dealers, beleaguered bureaucrats, and heartbreaking street victims\u2014not to mention the show\u2019s breakout character, Omar Little, a drug thief/Robin Hood figure who has made actor Michael K. Williams one of the show\u2019s true stars. <br><br>Omar is the favorite character of avowed \u201cWire\u201d fan Obama, who has also called the show one of his all-time favorites. It\u2019s only after watching \u201cThe Wire\u201d in its entirety that it becomes clear how significant a major politician being a \u201cWire\u201d fan really is. The show\u2019s about the system against the individual. More importantly, it\u2019s about how America\u2019s various wars\u2014the war on drugs, the war on the middle class, the war on crime, and, yes, the war in Iraq\u2014are hurting the very people they were meant to help. <br><br>In Baltimore, as in real life, every choice is connected; as Detective Lester Freamon puts it, \u201call the pieces matter.\u201d Watching \u201cThe Wire\u201d is a lesson in the frustrating compromises that go into everything from publishing a daily paper to convicting a killer to running a city (or country). And for all of us\u2014from future politicians, lawyers, and journalists to garden-variety citizens\u2014it has more than a few important messages about the real troubles that afflict this country. In the world of \u201cThe Wire,\u201d as the final episode so beautifully and movingly showed, everything moves in cycles, and the system feeds itself. The only way we can break it is by agitating en masse: against lies, against self-interest, against whatever we\u2019ve been told. Idealists in \u201cThe Wire\u201d are always alone, and they always get crushed. But groups can have power.<br><br>The writers of the show have taken that message to heart. In a co-signed editorial published in this week\u2019s issue of Time, they argue that any citizen asked to serve on a jury for a non-violent drug case should vote to acquit, no matter what the crime. It doesn\u2019t matter whether or not you agree; if the argument interests you, you need to track down DVDs of \u201cThe Wire.\u201d It\u2019s rare that a television show can offer that kind of intellectual honesty to its viewers. <br><br>Watching \u201cThe Wire\u201d wasn\u2019t always easy, but it was always rewarding. Baltimore, as one character describes it, is \u201ca dark corner of the American experiment.\u201d This Sunday, that experiment ended. But for some of you, and for the sake of the country we hold dear, I hope it\u2019s only just beginning.<br>\u2014Columnist Allie T. Pape can be reached at pape@fas.harvard.edu.</span></p>"}
{"title": "A Tainted Legacy | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>In an unsettling return to the Reagan Era\u2014still the cause of some mourning in America\u2014viewers of major news programs were treated to the reappearance of 72-year-old Geraldine Ferraro, former congresswoman and the second barrel on the souped-up Daisy Air Rifle that was the 1984 Mondale presidential ticket. Ferraro was defending her claims made in that bastion of political reporting, Torrance, Calif.\u2019s \u201cThe Daily Breeze,\u201d that Barack Obama\u2019s political success is tied in some way to the fact that he\u2019s black, which have been called, at best, counterintuitive and, at worst, baldly racist.\n<br><br>A quick read reveals that they are counterintuitive; in fact they\u2019re nonsense. Despite their steady dwindling, hate crimes and racial tension persist across the country. While these phenomena certainly don\u2019t indicate any peculiar suppression or active organized racism, to make the claim that even the Democratic electorate actually prefers a black man to his Caucasian equivalent\u2014Ferraro called Obama \u201clucky\u201d\u2014is to presume an epiphany of toleration among the people for whom \u2018the Bradley Effect\u2019 was conceived.\n<br><br>The slow, tortuous confrontation of racism has been called America\u2019s great historic struggle. Even the institution of race-based hiring decisions\u2014with their good intentions paving the way to hell as ever\u2014forebodes a future still far removed from that nebulous multicultural promise of \u201ccolor-blindness.\u201d \n<br><br>There may be some logic to a small population of left-leaning voters elevating Obama as the ultimate American ideal, who conquered racial prejudiceand relative poverty by his own merits, and resisted the appeal of high-paying positions in law. The reality, though, is that Obama\u2019s message appears to have the capacity to transcend racial bias where Alan Keyes or Al Sharpton\u2019s have failed; he may just have a bit more of that Weberian charisma than Hillary Clinton. He certainly has more than Walter Mondale, next to whom John Kerry gains a sudden, electric appeal.\n<br><br>Ferraro, for her part, hasn\u2019t backed down from her comments, but she has jumped ship as Clinton\u2019s \u201cHonorary New York Leadership Council Chair,\u201d a position that, while sounding meaningless, had the congresswoman campaigning on Clinton\u2019s behalf. That said, her letter of resignation has all the contrite grace of a Molotov cocktail hurled into one\u2019s former workplace. She writes, \u201cI am stepping down from your finance committee so I can speak for myself\u2026The Obama campaign is attacking me to hurt you. I won\u2019t let that happen.\u201d So, having issued her blunt rhetorical assault, the closest thing Clinton has to a historical precedent can only bring herself to apologize for a political misstep\u2014not a personal prejudice revealed.\n<br><br>Particularly disturbing is the revelation that the former feminist icon had said nearly the exact same thing about Jesse Jackson\u2019s doomed 1988 run for the White House, back when her language couldn\u2019t be chalked up to her bygone era or senility. This seems to cast a shadow on some of the past days\u2019 saber-rattling, too\u2014for example, Ferraro said yesterday, \u201cI really think they\u2019re attacking me because I\u2019m white. How\u2019s that?\u201d In spite of all evidence to the contrary, she seems convinced that American voters are practicing affirmative action on their secret ballots.\n<br><br>When the Obama campaign attacks her, they certainly are trying to besmirch the Clintons\u2019 (kind of) good name; such is the nature of bruising national politics. However, when we as unbiased political observers say that Geraldine Ferraro seems a hypocrite and a bigot in making these conspiratorial accusations about not one black politician, but all of them, we would appear to be justified by factual evidence. After all, these men confront the same sort of barrier to entry that she came upon two decades ago. One could argue that theirs is even higher.\n<br><br>We cannot help but feel the pangs of sadness as this bias becomes more and more clear. Ferraro, once labeled \u201csomething that rhymes with rich\u201d (to quote Barbara Bush) did in courageous failure pave the way for this year\u2019s historic primary. Now, older, off her game and embroiled in the vitriolic message warfare attached to that primary, she appears to have debased her own iconic legacy in an attempt to sully another\u2014Obama\u2019s\u2014which is still being shaped.\n<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">James M.

{"title": "McCain a Flip-Flopper? | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Now that Senator John S. McCain has clinched the Republican nomination, he must overcome an identity crisis. Should he change his history of bipartisan voting to strengthen his Republican kinship ties? Or will his attempts to woo the right-wingers of his party alienate Independents? McCain\u2019s recent flip-flop on torture suggests that he is trying to attract the right-wing Republican vote. That seems to explain why McCain, one of the nation\u2019s staunchest opponents of torture, voted not to pass an anti-torture bill.<br><br>This came as a surprise for those who know of McCain\u2019s long battle with the Bush administration and members of his own party to ban the use of torture by the United States. Once a prisoner of war in Vietnam, Senator McCain has led the Senate in calling on the White House to ban torture by words and by action. Torture shouldn\u2019t be a Republican or a Democratic issue, and McCain reassured the public that you didn\u2019t have to espouse torture to be a true Republican.<br><br>So why has the senator voted against an anti-torture bill that his colleagues in the Senate passed?<br><br>The Intelligence Authorization Bill bans the Central Intelligence Agency from using acts of torture. It calls on the CIA to follow the United States Army Field Manual on Human Intelligence Collector Operations in the treatment of individuals. For Senator McCain, this bill was a seminal opportunity to enact measures he has been advocating for years. The bill explicitly banned waterboarding, and McCain has been one of the strongest voices calling on the White House to ban the practice as torture. <br><br>Yet when asked to explain his recent vote, McCain argued, \u201cWhat we need is not to tie the CIA to the Army Field Manual, but rather to have a good faith interpretation of the statutes that guide what is permissible in the CIA program.\u201d  This is interesting since McCain has been pushing anti-torture legislation for the very reason that the CIA has not been acting in \u201cgood faith\u201d on their statutes. <br><br>Many might find McCain\u2019s decision confusing, but as Randy Scheunemann, McCain\u2019s top national security adviser, stated, \u201cIt\u2019s easily explainable and easily understood by the American people.\u201d  Yet what the American people will take away from this experience is that McCain\u2019s vote was cast entirely in light of his bid for the Republican nomination. He is uncharacteristically siding with the president on the issue of torture. This dramatic change in position reflects McCain\u2019s attempt to reach out to President George W. Bush\u2019s many enthusiastic far-right supporters; he is unabashedly trying to solidify his Republican base to win the presidency. Sacrificing principle for power is evidently a price Senator McCain is willing to pay. <br><br>Indeed, torture isn\u2019t the only issue on which McCain is willing to flip-flop. After criticizing Reverend Jerry Falwell for being an \u201cagent of intolerance,\u201d McCain delivered a commencement speech at the \u201cMoral Majority\u201d leader\u2019s Liberty University, reaching out to religious conservatives.  After claiming he \u201ccannot in good conscience support\u201d  President Bush\u2019s tax cuts, Senator McCain recently voted to continue some of the tax cuts in the $70 billion Tax Relief Extension Reconciliation Act.<br><br>This is disappointing, to say the least. McCain\u2019s flip-flop isn\u2019t analogous to, for example, Martin Luther King Jr. opposing a bill desegregating buses. After all, McCain is running for President and some compromises must be made. However, his willingness to compromise on issues he has been so principled on in the past is jarring. <br><br>On Jan. 17, this paper\u2019s staff published an editorial endorsing Senator John McCain for the Republican nomination, praising among other things his \u201cunequivocal\u201d stance on torture.  The Harvard Crimson wasn\u2019t alone in admiring McCain\u2019s staunch opposition to torture. Democrats, Republicans, and Independents alike commended McCain for standing up against the current administration to ban the use of torture in the War on Terror. His courage led members of both parties to admire him as a trustworthy leader. For many, that admiration has changed to disbelief and disappointment.<br><br>McCain has made his choice; he is no longer the trustworthy McCain whom Independents can count on to vote on principle even when that means opposing the leadership of his own Republican Party. In addition to sacrificing principle though, McCain might be sacrificing important Independent votes, and his acceptance of President Bush\u2019s endorsement isn\u2019t going to help in that respect.  He is counting on the fact that his flip-flop to the far-right will gain him Republican Party support, but this is a dangerous political game for him to play. During this election, Independent votes are predicted to be valuable, and the cost of McCain\u2019s inconsistency\u2014defeat in the general election\u2014might not be worth whatever it is that comes along with President Bush\u2019s endorsement.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Nafees Syed \u201910 is a government concentrator in Leverett House.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Ignatieff\u2019s \u2018Getting Iraq Wrong\u2019 Gets Harvard Wrong, Ex-Colleagues Say | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Bombs were already falling over Baghdad as Michael G. Ignatieff and Kanan Makiya sat having drinks in a Cambridge restaurant. It was March 19, 2003. The ultimatum President George W. Bush had given Saddam Hussein\u2014leave Iraq or we invade\u2014had just expired. The mood of the two friends was somber. <br><br>Both men were humanitarians who had become prominent advocates of war in Iraq. That evening, they had participated in a panel discussion at Harvard\u2019s Institute of Politics on \u201cWar in Iraq: An Advance or Setback to Middle East Peace?\u201d <br><br>Both had argued for the invasion on idealistic grounds.  After the panel, at the Brattle Street restaurant Casablanca, the human cost of the war was very much on their minds, Ignatieff said. <br><br>But Ignatieff remembers Makiya, an Iraqi expatriate, saying, \u201cLook, this is the first and only chance in my lifetime for my people to create a decent society.\u201d <br><br>\u201cAt the time,\u201d Ignatieff said in a recent interview, \u201cI thought the price was worth it.\u201d <br><br>THINK AGAIN <br><br>Ignatieff has described this conversation with Makiya, who appears only as a nameless Iraqi expatriate, in two separate New York Times Magazine articles about his own position on the war. <br><br>It is a memory he keeps returning to, as if by describing his impression of Makiya\u2019s idealism he can finally explain his own. <br><br>Ignatieff made a splash in early 2003 by coming out as a liberal supporter of the war. He wasn\u2019t the only prominent pro-war intellectual at Harvard, but he stood out among those like Harvard Kennedy School professor Ashton B. Carter and neo-conservative Government professor Stephen P. Rosen \u201974, who pushed for war on the basis of American interests abroad. <br><br>Ignatieff began to reevaluate his stance on Iraq soon after the invasion, he said in a phone interview from Toronto, where he now serves as a member of the Canadian parliament. <br><br>At the same time as his opinion on Iraq was shifting, he was also moving from academia\u2014where he had served as the director of Harvard\u2019s Carr Center for Human Rights Policy\u2014to politics. He returned to his native country in 2005 and rose to prominence in the opposition Liberal Party. <br><br>This August, Ignatieff wrote an article, \u201cGetting Iraq Wrong,\u201d in which he recanted his support for the war. <br><br>It was one of the first times an intellectual had publicly held himself accountable for his stance on the Iraq war. <br><br>But the article, a lengthy rumination on the nature of judgment, rubbed many people the wrong way. <br><br>\u201cAs a former denizen of Harvard, I\u2019ve had to learn that a sense of reality doesn\u2019t always flourish in elite institutions,\u201d Ignatieff wrote, concluding, \u201cBus drivers can display a shrewder grasp of what\u2019s what than Nobel Prize winners.\u201d  <br><br>Ignatieff\u2019s old Harvard colleagues said the article perplexed and disappointed them. <br><br>In an article billed as an apology, Ignatieff seemed to spend a lot of time attributing responsibility to those other than himself. <br><br>\u201cWhat I found strange was that the article seemed to be suggesting that Harvard and the academic world were somehow responsible for his pro-war views,\u201d said Kennedy School professor Alexander Keyssar \u201969, who has known Ignatieff since they were graduate students. \u201cYet most of the faculty I know here opposed the war.\u201d <br><br>Kennedy School professor Stephen M. Walt, who opposed the war from the beginning, said Ignatieff\u2019s article \u201cgot it backwards.\u201d <br><br>\u201cThe problem was not that he listened to idealists in the academy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s rather that he didn\u2019t listen to the voices in the academy who were explaining why it [war] was a foolish idea.\u201d <br><br>\u201cI think I phrased it in a manner that could have been improved,\u201d Ignatieff said. \u201cYou can have a very shrewd sense of reality in any environment. Harvard doesn\u2019t give you a privileged view of the world. You can get it wrong at Harvard. You an also get it right at Harvard.\u201d <br><br>He named colleagues\u2014including Walt, former Barack Obama adviser Samantha Power, Rev. J. Bryan Hehir, and Stanley Hoffmann\u2014whose concerns about the war in Iraq had proved prescient. <br><br>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want my remarks to imply or suggest that I\u2019m criticizing my colleagues and friends for a lack of realism,\u201d he said.  \u201cThat sounds pretty weird, doesn\u2019t it? I got it wrong.\u201d <br><br>MOVING ON\u2014TOO FAST? <br><br>In his article, Ignatieff criticized not only the atmosphere of the Ivory Tower, but the very nature of the academic project. <br><br>Ignatieff\u2019s article attempted to draw distinctions between the judgment of academics\u2014his past profession\u2014and politicians, what he is today. <br><br>\u201cIn academic life, false ideas are merely false, and useless ones can be fun to play with,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn political life, false ideas can ruin the lives of millions, and useless ones can waste precious resources.\u201d<br><br>Coming from a man who recently moved from academia to politics, it\u2019s an argument that can seem uncomfortably self-serving. <br><br>It\u2019s also one that makes little sense when applied to the United States\u2019 march to war in 2002 and 2003, Walt said. <br><br>\u201cVoices challenging the decision for war were much more frequent, were much more common in the academy than they were in the American political system,\u201d Walt said. \u201cInside the beltway in Washington, almost everybody seemed to be in favor of it.\u201d <br><br>MEA CULPA<br><br>Ignatieff\u2019s account of the particular factors that led to his own failure of judgment comes in a single paragraph near the end of the article. <br><br>A 1992 visit to the sites of the Kurdish genocide carried out on the orders of Saddam in Northern Iraq gave Ignatieff vivid, personal reasons for opposing Saddam\u2019s regime. <br><br>\u201cThe lesson I draw for the future is to be less influenced by the passions of people I admire\u2014Iraqi exiles, for example\u2014and to be less swayed by my emotions,\u201d Ignatieff wrote. <br><br>This unresolved tension between the initial argument Ignatieff makes about the dangers of academic judgment and the final reasons he provides for his own mistake is part of what has made his apology controversial. <br><br>Ignatieff criticized academics for being too theoretical and too detached. <br><br>But his misjudgment on Iraq was fueled by a lack of detachment\u2014valuing emotion before ideas.  <br><br>\u201cI just think he misdiagnosed the source of his error,\u201d Walt said. <br><br>\u201cYou start to think the emotions themselves are reasons, and they\u2019re not reasons,\u201d Ignatieff said in a recent interview. <br><br>His decision finally to disavow his support for the war came down to the body count. <br><br>\u201cI simply did not estimate the horrendous, inexcusable cost,\u201d he said. <br><br>\u201cI didn\u2019t think it would be this hard.\u201d <br><br>\u2014Staff writer Lois E.

{"title": "Taking a Hike on the Presidential Trail | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>After the race for Undergraduate Council president and vice president in 2006, running mates Edward Y. Lee \u201908 and Ali A. Zaidi \u201908-\u201909 both thought their campaigning days were over. <br><br>\u201cAfter that campaign, we said we\u2019re never going to work on a campaign again,\u201d Lee says. <br><br>But he quickly proved himself wrong. <br><br>Following his unsuccessful bid for the UC\u2019s second-in-command, Lee assumed a different kind of political role instead: working for Sen. Barack Obama\u2019s presidential campaign. <br><br>EMBARKING ON THE TRAIL <br><br>A self-proclaimed science-and-math guy, Lee says he wasn\u2019t particularly interested in politics before being inspired by Obama. <br><br>\u201cAs soon as I heard his speech at the Democratic National Convention in 2004, I immediately said, \u2018that\u2019s the guy that\u2019s going to change this country. If he ever decides to run for President, I\u2019m going to do anything I can to make him the next President,\u2019\u201d Lee says. <br><br>True to his word, Lee began interning for the Obama campaign last summer at the Senator\u2019s New Hampshire office. <br><br>After he arrived in New Hampshire with his video camera, he was asked to join the office\u2019s New Media team, taping speeches and making videos for the campaign. As an intern, he says he also spent about five hours a day knocking on the doors of New Hampshire residents. <br><br>In August, Lee had packed his things to return to Harvard when his boss on the campaign told him they wanted him to stay on through the semester as a paid campaign staffer. <br><br>CAMPAIGN SUPPORTERS <br><br>Lee said his immediate instinct was to turn down the job, thinking he needed to go back to school. He e-mailed at least 30 of his mentors and friends, asking for advice on what he should do, and received an overwhelming response in favor of taking the job. <br><br>\u201cTheir idea was that Harvard will always be there, but Barack will not always be there,\u201d says the Overland Park, Kan. native. <br><br>One of the people he sought advice from was sociology professor Tamara Kay. Lee had taken two courses taught by Kay that were particularly relevant to his work on the campaign: \u201cLaw and Social Movements\u201d and \u201cVisualizing Social Problems in Documentary Film and Photography.\u201d <br><br>\u201cI think there are very few moments that come in life that you could do something you are that passionate about,\u201d Kay says. \u201cI knew he\u2019d get a lot out of it, and the long-term costs to him were minimal, if any.\u201d <br><br>But some people had hesitations about Lee taking time off from school. <br><br>\u201cOne of the things that I told him was to really consider the impact it could have on some of the relationships he had developed at Harvard,\u201d says Chiduzie C. Madubata \u201906, who met Lee through the InterVarsity Christian Fellowship. <br><br>Lee says that his while his mom was initially very supportive of his taking time off, his dad\u2014a Clinton supporter\u2014was a bit more hesitant. <br><br>\u201cNow I think he\u2019s seen the light and come over to the good side,\u201d Lee jokes. <br><br>Both his parents are now strong supporters of Obama and consistently follow Obama in the news. <br><br>So last fall, as his fellow Kirkland House residents moved back into their dorm rooms, Lee remained in his apartment in New Hampshire, beginning his first job as a full-time staff member of the Obama campaign. <br><br>A DAY IN THE LIFE <br><br>Many of Lee\u2019s days working for Obama were spent in the campaign\u2019s New Hampshire headquarters in Manchester. <br><br>Days in the office would begin around 9 a.m., when Lee would arrive at work. According to Lee, there were about 50 campaign staff members working in the office, and 30 to 40 volunteers there at any given time. <br><br>Lee says he was not able to visit home between August and January, so the other staff members and volunteers became like family. He and three other members of the New Hampshire office\u2019s New Media staff had their four desks placed together in a square. <br><br>Lee says the citizens of New Hampshire also made the staffers feel at home. <br><br>\u201cI think one of the most endearing things was that they took care of us,\u201d Lee says of the state\u2019s residents. \u201cAll the time they would call us and say, \u2018you guys are doing very good work, keep it up.\u2019\u201d <br><br>Lee says he would spend the day putting together videos for the Web site before leaving the office around 11 p.m. During his time with the campaign, he says he made about 50 videos, including three 15-minute documentaries. His only days off last semester, he says, were Thanksgiving and Christmas. <br><br>MEET AND GREET <br><br>But the long hours he put in were not the only part of his work that made it different from a typical 9-to-5 job: More than half the time, Lee says he travelled around the state with the campaign. <br><br>In addition to filming many speeches and events, Lee also attended rallies and house and organizational meetings. <br><br>\u201cI think being able to be on the road showed me how much of a movement this whole campaign is,\u201d he says. <br><br>Lee had the chance to meet a number of people who came to the state to campaign on behalf of Obama. When Sen. Richard J. Durbin was in New Hampshire, Lee and a fellow Obama employee were given the task of driving him around the state. <br><br>\u201cCanvassing with Dick Durbin was probably one of the more memorable experiences I\u2019ve had,\u201d Lee says. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the most prominent senators in the United States, and yet he\u2019s knocking on the doors, and you\u2019re beside him every step of the way.\u201d <br><br>Another memorable experience for Lee was meeting Oprah Winfrey. Lee says he shook her hand and gave her a hug after filming her at a rally last December. <br><br>But driving Durbin around and hugging Oprah probably weren\u2019t as exciting as a certain basketball game he was able to play. <br><br>Lee and two other staffers even were able to shoot hoops with Obama before the candidate played basketball with some reporters. <br><br>\u201cHe was one of the most down to earth people you\u2019ll ever meet,\u201d says Lee, who was there to film the game. \u201cHe is a very funny guy, and he\u2019s very genuine. Everything he said you could tell that he actually meant it.\u201d <br><br>The second time he met Obama also involved sports. At a baseball game, one of Lee\u2019s friends was eating French fries. The Senator came over and took some fries from him, promising he would pay the friend back. At the end of the game, Lee says, Obama made good on his promise and bought Lee\u2019s friend another batch of fries. <br><br>BACK IN THE \u2018KIDDIE POOL\u2019 <br><br>Lee compares his transition back to Harvard to being in a kiddie pool after swimming in an ocean. <br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to be here in a classroom working on a problem set when all my friends and coworkers are working to make him president,\u201d Lee said. <br><br>But perhaps Harvard and the real world aren\u2019t so different after all, at least when it comes to campaigns. <br><br>Lee says he has come to see that the Obama campaign was similar in some ways to his campaign for UC vice president: he sees them as sharing messages of idealism and hope. <br><br>There was one main difference, though. <br><br>\u201cBarack Obama\u2019s campaign is a lot more organized,\u201d he laughs. <br><br>\u2014Staff writer Lauren D.

{"title": "The Brown Blessing | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Hearing his policies and not his name, Louisiana\u2019s recently inaugurated governor sounds like a traditional Southern conservative. He has a track record of supporting permanent military presence in Iraq, legislating against a woman\u2019s right to an abortion, allowing government surveillance without a warrant, upholding tough immigration enforcement, shooting down gun control laws, and prohibiting human embryonic stem cell research. Indeed, the main reason Bobby Jindal\u2014the state\u2019s first minority governor since Reconstruction\u2014catapulted to victory was that he was so utterly indistinguishable from the mostly white voting base. <br><br>Why, then, do so many Indian-Americans support him? After all, Indians voted for Kerry over Bush in the 2004 election by a four-to-one ratio, and are overwhelmingly registered as Democrats. Jindal, however, is all business and no bleeding heart. As Times of India columnist Shashi Tharoor writes in his scathing piece \u201cShould We Be Proud of Bobby Jindal?\u201d \u201cMany Indians born in America have tended to sympathize with other people of color, identifying their lot with other immigrants, the poor, the underclass\u2026 None of this for Bobby.\u201d The unpleasant truth is that he\u2019s a desi hero for the wrong reasons\u2014lauded not for his beliefs but for his race. <br><br>This is not to say that Indians in the States don\u2019t have their doubts about Jindal; some do. For many, though, any qualms over Jindal\u2019s neoconservative politics are overcome by pride in his brown skin and the progress this supposedly signifies. Unfortunately, this perception is mostly wishful thinking. Unlike the immigrant families I know who still proudly hang diwali lanterns and shop at the local Bharat Bazaar, Jindal has done the best he can to assimilate by erasing his cultural origins. Changing his name as a child from the Punjabi Piyush to that of his favorite character on The Brady Bunch, converting from Hinduism to Christianity as a senior in high school (and later asking his wife to do the same), attending Brown University and Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar, working as a consultant at McKinsey, and adopting a flat Louisiana drawl\u2014the only part of \u201cIndian-American\u201d he embodies lies after the hyphen. <br><br>This raises an unsettling question: does a minority have to \u201cact white\u201d to get elected? As is the case with many politicians, it\u2019s hard to discern Jindal\u2019s genuine beliefs from statements designed to cater to the average Louisiana voter. Although his broad platform promise to \u201cend corruption in Louisiana\u201d is universally appealing, you can bet that the more extreme viewpoints he dishes up to white Republicans get omitted from the soothing \u201cheritage\u201d speeches he gives at Indian-American fundraising dinners. Jindal has been very successful indeed at working his innate advantage and tapping the latent ethnic pride (some would call it racism) felt by other people of his color. <br><br>Race-based politics are nothing new, of course\u2014you can trace the effect of racial issues on government all the way from the civil rights movement to the debate over Barack Obama\u2019s \u201celectability\u201d raging today. Whether or not the Indian vote actually affected the election, however (the magnitude of Jindal\u2019s victory makes it unlikely), it\u2019s a pity that so many influential members of the Indian community unquestioningly followed the lead of a man with whom they shared only superficial similarities. <br><br>Reactions to Jindal by Indians in the homeland have been more negative than those in the American Diaspora. But the mentality there, as well as here, is telling. Following the news of Jindal\u2019s win, the Times of India telephoned Bobby\u2019s cousin Gulshan. \u201cIt\u2019s a great honor not just for our family, but Punjab and the nation as well, [for] the son of this soil [to] have achieved something really big,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, celebrations were erupting in Jindal\u2019s ancestral village of Khanpura, as locals shared sweets and danced exultantly to bhangra music. Nobody asked what Jindal stood for. <br><br><em>Jessica A. Sequeira \u201911, a Crimson editorial editor, lives in Canaday Hall.</em></span></p>"}
{"title": "Obama: A New Politics of Change | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Last Thursday, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama emerged from the Iowa caucuses with a decisive victory over his two main opponents, former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards and New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton. At first glance, the wide margin of Obama\u2019s victory might seem inexplicable. After all, every Democratic candidate supports withdrawal from Iraq, a broad expansion of health care, a comprehensive solution to the threat of climate change, and a host of other progressive reforms. In the absence of major differences between the candidates\u2019 policy positions, Obama\u2019s victory might seem to be a fluke\u2014a function of some factor as arbitrary as the weather or the Orange Bowl. <br><br>Yet Obama\u2019s victory represents something more than a brief aberration in the ordinary political process. Obama won with enthusiastic support from more groups than his typical strongholds\u2014college students and highly educated liberals. More women voted for Obama than for Clinton; more union members and their families voted for Obama than for Edwards. Clearly, then, his victory in Iowa was not only a consequence of his campaign\u2019s ability to mobilize an established base of voters. <br><br>Instead, Obama\u2019s appeal across the boundaries of race, class, and gender is a testament to a less tangible difference that sets him apart from the rest of the Democratic field. That difference is his emphasis on change as the unifying theme of his campaign. Certainly, other candidates in recent weeks have attempted to appropriate the theme of change. In Saturday\u2019s Democratic debate, Hillary Clinton used the word \u201cchange\u201d 23 times; John Edwards used it 14 times. <br><br>But Obama remains the only candidate to forcefully argue that we must change the way politics itself works to successfully change our policies. Only Obama has consistently offered a coherent vision of the way in which a broken political system\u2014in which politicians decide what to say, how to vote, and with whom to cooperate for re-election based on partisan loyalties\u2014leads to poor decisions. Certainly, the Bush administration was at fault for the misguided invasion of Iraq, but the effort was aided and abetted by those members of Congress who, fearing that standing up for their convictions would make them look weak on national security, voted to authorize the war. <br><br>The crux of Obama\u2019s argument is that we must the existing political system with one that rewards honesty, pragmatism, and responsiveness if the country is to solve its problems. His background as a legislator, his tone in public speeches, and his campaign\u2019s refusal to engage in mudslinging or to accept money from lobbyists all demonstrate his deep commitment and ability to bring about such sweeping change in American politics. <br><br>Once again, the Iowa caucuses provide evidence for the power of this message: Of the majority of caucus-goers who said that \u201cchange\u201d was the single most important issue for them, more than half voted for Obama, compared to 19 for Clinton and 20 for Edwards. Moreover, Obama won decisively among the unprecedented 57 percent of caucus-goers who had never attended a caucus before. The record turnout in Iowa, especially among the formerly politically apathetic, shows that his campaign is already starting to achieve its aims. <br><br>Both by virtue of who he is\u2014an African-American, a relatively young candidate, a fresh face with an unconventional background\u2014and because of his efforts to win voters outside the traditional Democratic primary base, Obama\u2019s candidacy has drawn into the political process many people who have never supported a candidate before. He is able to give them, for the first time, an investment in their government and a sense that the political system is responsive to them. <br><br>Despite the palpable enthusiasm nationwide for Obama\u2019s candidacy, there remains the lingering suspicion that it might all be a pipe dream. After all, it\u2019s easy to talk about changing the political system on the campaign trail; it\u2019s much more difficult to put it into practice in the harsh Washington world of backroom deals and partisan squabbles. <br><br>Hillary Clinton, particularly, has integrated this skepticism into her recent campaign appearances, regularly saying, \u201cSome believe you can get change by hoping for it. I believe you get change by working hard.\u201d After her defeat in Iowa, she intensified the attack, accusing Obama of instilling \u201cfalse hopes\u201d in Americans. Only a candidate who has weathered the storms of Republican attacks, Clinton argues, can manipulate the political system to implement changes in policy. <br><br>But this argument relies on a shallow and misguided interpretation of Obama\u2019s hope. As he said in his victory speech after the Iowa caucuses, \u201cHope is not blind optimism\u2026Hope is that thing inside us that insists, despite all the evidence to the contrary, that something better awaits us if we have the courage to reach for it and to work for it and to fight for it.\u201d This is the transformative power of Obama\u2019s candidacy: He offers a vision of change more ambitious than any candidate has in a generation, without losing sight of the integral role that hard work plays in achieving that change. <br><br>Every Democrat on the New Hampshire ballots offers policies that comprise a sea change from eight years of the Bush administration, but only Barack Obama can move beyond the level of policy to reshape the political system in a way that puts the common good, rather than power struggles, at the forefront of policymaking.<br><br><em>Eva Z.

{"title": "Our Primary Concern | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>For Illinois Sen. Barack Obama and Mike Huckabee, victory in last Thursday\u2019s Iowa caucuses means increased media exposure, a jump in donations, and a surge in polls nationwide. All of these gains supposedly justify the $30 million the candidates spent on advertising in Iowa and the approximately 350 visits to the state they made during the election season, which would otherwise be difficult to fathom considering Iowa\u2019s few delegates.  \r<br><br>We are deeply troubled by this system. It gives undue influence, during each election cycle, to a handful of states with early primaries or caucuses, while rendering the contests of states that vote late in the schedule almost meaningless. Nevertheless, we sympathize with the argument that a spread-out election schedule gives candidates the greatest opportunity to make their cases to voters in each state. Therefore, the best way to set up a fair primary would be to rotate the order that states vote in from cycle to cycle, ensuring that every state has an opportunity to be early, yet the candidates have enough time to make their case to each.\r<br><br>Iowans have undoubtedly benefited from their position in the schedule\u2014their favorite political issues, such as ethanol subsidies, have received special attention; campaigns have flooded their economy with spending; and many have had the opportunity to see several of the candidates in person. Voters in states with later primaries, on the other hand, receive none of these benefits. Montana and South Dakota have their primaries on June 3rd this year, which means votes cast in those states will almost certainly be irrelevant. These voters are effectively disenfranchised, and are unlikely to receive attention from the candidates before the party conventions.\r<br><br>This inequality is unfair and undemocratic. According to a November National Bureau of Economic Research working paper, earlier voters can have up to 20 times the influence of later voters in the primaries. This distorts the issues that candidates focus on and shuts certain states out of the selection process. There is no reason we should allow Iowa or New Hampshire to hold a privileged position in primary season every four years. Instead of starting with the same states during every election, we ought to rotate the states that have the earliest primaries each time.\r<br><br>Nevertheless, suggestions that Democrats and Republicans should switch to a nationwide primary are misguided. Having all states vote simultaneously would disrupt the small scale of  primaries that allows voters a close and detailed perspective on the candidates. In the tradition of retail politics, many voters can meet candidates in person and take time to get to know their positions. Second, the extended schedule allows candidates with relatively little money or national name recognition, such as Huckabee, to gain momentum on the strength of their appeal to voters who have plumbed their positions firsthand. \r<br><br>Lastly, we believe that states like Iowa that hold caucuses should switch to a traditional primary system. The caucus system itself is notoriously undemocratic. The process, which takes several hours and does away with the secret ballot, has been aptly described as arcane. In addition, voters who cannot make it to the primary because they are working, sick, or deployed overseas have no way to participate. The sampling of Iowan voters that make it to the caucuses\u2014under 15 percent of the voting-age population, even with this year\u2019s record turnouts\u2014is therefore not necessarily representative of the state. \r<br><br>While the decision to abandon the primacy of the caucus system or the current primary schedule would be vigorously opposed by party leaders and special interests in the early states, we must recognize that the national interest and the integrity of our democratic system requires that we not disenfranchise other states. A rotating system would preserve the benefits of a drawn-out primary season while making the process fair for all constituencies.\r<br><br></span></p>"}
{"title": "Change Plus Experience: Governor Bill Richardson for President | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The lesson of the results at the Iowa caucus is that Democrats are hungry for a new kind of politics.  They are looking for a political leader who faces forward, not backward, and who embodies change in a real sense.\n<br><br>The best candidate to fundamentally change our country\u2019s course is the same candidate with the most extensive record of success.  That candidate is N. M. Gov. Bill Richardson.\n<br><br>Richardson has won a lot of positive coverage for his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, but a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is only as important as what it signifies for the future.  Bill Richardson has already accomplished in his long career in public service so much of what we desperately need to achieve nationwide.\n<br><br>Climate change and our energy policy should be the first concern of the next president.  Richardson, who served as Secretary of Energy during the Clinton administration, has offered the boldest plan for addressing climate change.  He understands the sheer magnitude of the challenge we face, and has proposed nothing short of a revolution in energy policy.  He even wrote a book, \u201cLeadership by Example,\u201d about how to solve the climate crisis.\n<br><br>The next president will also have a big challenge repairing our image in the world after the past seven years of disastrous myopic leadership.  Who better to begin reaching out to our allies, negotiating with our enemies, and reintegrating the US into the world community than a former ambassador to the United Nations, hostage negotiator, and five-time nominee for the Nobel Peace Prize?  Richardson jokes, \u201cBad guys like me.\u201d\n<br><br>While other candidates express moral outrage about the genocide in Darfur from the comfort of Washington, Bill Richardson actually traveled there to negotiate a ceasefire.\n<br><br>He is the only major candidate calling for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq with no residual forces because as he fully understands, what we lack in Iraq is political progress, and our military presence prolongs the violence.  What we need in Iraq is a \u201cdiplomatic surge\u201d and Richardson, who actually understands the region, is the best candidate to make this succeed.\n<br><br>On domestic issues like immigration, education, and health care, Richardson had to deal with the harsh realities of the situation as the two-term governor of New Mexico and former congressman for 14 years.  He\u2019s been such a successful governor that he garnered 40 percent of the Republican vote in his reelection.  His approval ratings are consistently above 60 percent and always some of the highest in the nation.\n<br><br>As Governor, he cut $230 million in bureaucratic waste, created 84,000 new jobs, built a new rail line to boost public transportation, and throughout his public life, he has sought to give voice to those left out of the process, including Native Americans.  He balanced five budgets, raised teacher pay dramatically, and fought unemployment down to the lowest levels in 30 years.  He has an excellent record on taxes and is consistently rated one of the nation\u2019s most fiscally responsible governors.\n<br><br>Gov. Richardson is not your typical candidate.  He\u2019s got a laid-back Western style about him.  He\u2019s humble, funny, self-deprecating, and exceedingly honest.  He does not speak in sound bites, and most voters get a sense from him that he actually answers the questions posed to him.  \n<br><br>He\u2019s also has a different way of looking at things.  Richardson supports the decriminalization of marijuana, and is more pro-gun than the other candidates.  Democrats may not agree with him on every issue, but we know that he\u2019s analyzed every issue and come to his own position carefully and thoughtfully.\n<br><br>Richardson likes to joke that\u2019s he\u2019s no rock star, but he does have a natural ability to connect with the people he meets, and his authenticity shines through and makes him the candidate best able to appeal to independents and Republicans and bring victory home for the forces of good come November.\n<br><br>Throughout this whole election process, Richardson has stayed consistently positive, has avoided negative attacks, and has displayed his mastery of the issues. Any gaffes or lackluster debate performances are an unfortunate consequence of a more direct and honest approach to politics.  He\u2019s not slick and he\u2019s not Washington, but then again, after the past seven years, I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s what anyone wants.\n<br><br>The days for voting for the guy you want to have a beer with are over.  America needs a leader who is going to tell the hard truths and make the difficult decisions and sacrifices to begin to really solve the major issues we face. How do we get out of Iraq?  How do we mitigate the effects of global warming?  How do we repair our image in the world?  How do we make sure Americans can afford healthcare?  How do we prepare our school system and economy for the flat world, especially as China rises in power?\n<br><br>Flashy rhetoric isn\u2019t going to solve these issues.  Neither will divisive partisanship and political jockeying.  2008 is a landmark election, and we need a candidate with a proven record of success.  I have nothing bad to say about Senators Obama, Clinton, and Edwards, but I do believe Gov. Bill Richardson stands above the rest in his ability to recognize the challenges we face and deal with them honestly, thoroughly, and courageously.\n<br><br>And if all of that hasn\u2019t sold you, well then isn\u2019t it time we had a chubby president\u2014one who truly reflects America?  \n<br><br>Plus, he\u2019s a cowboy.

Politicians who promise to sweep past the System disappoint and/or deceive. Recognizing this fact is not selling out to the system; it\u2019s just practical politics. \n<br><br>Furthermore, red and blue are not going away and blithe assumptions that the partisan divide can be transcended is a recipe for a superficial politics that will change nothing. Mere hope is nothing within the system. Democrats will move beyond red and blue when they actually get something done.\n<br><br>On matters of public policy, encompassing both international relations and domestic issues, the differences between the major Democratic candidates are inconsequential. This is true both because there are very few, if any, meaningful stated differences among them and, more importantly, because whatever differences that do exist are insignificant in relation to the more meaningful question of whether any of the candidates\u2019 public policy proposals can ever actually be implemented. Voters may develop the impression that there are meaningful policy differences, but this is a tribute to their prejudices or to the skill of politicians in creating a general impression that important differences exist when, in fact, they do not.\n<br><br>So, with these hard truths in mind, which Democrat running for president is best suited to navigate the complex web of political ideology, special interests, and lobbies that will dominate American politics for the foreseeable future? Who will actually get something done? Hillary Clinton, who has the most preparation, experience, and knowledge ever combined in one Presidential candidate, and who also happens to be a woman, is clearly the candidate best suited at this particular moment in our history.\n<br><br>A measured but unquestionably tough liberal Democrat, already one of the most famous and respected women in the world, only Hillary is up to the task of leading us out of Iraq, resolving the Iran stand-off, and dealing with events in Afghanistan and Pakistan while re-bonding with our traditional allies. \n<br><br>When it comes to domestic policy, no one has a better sense of when to compromise, \u201ctriangulate\u201d (a word no one should be afraid of), and fight the good fight when this is what is required to get the job done. Only Hillary\u2019s unmatched combination of Executive, Congressional, and political experience, in addition to an entire career dedicated to resolving of the major domestic issues of our time\u2014medicine, education, poverty\u2014is suited to get the job done.\n<br><br>Hillary is not without her bad history. When Obama and Edwards were two lawyers, years away from entering public life, Hillary was making a mess of revolutionizing the country\u2019s medical system, a worthy project that was politically botched. Had she not demonstrated again and again since that time that she has learned from these and other mistakes we would not be writing this editorial.\n<br><br>Her Democratic rivals, by comparison, have no history of mistakes on the big stage from which they could have derived hard lessons. (Guest spots on Oprah don\u2019t count.) Obama claims superior \u201cjudgment\u201d to Hillary because, as an Illinois State Senator, he opposed the Iraq war, while the majority of Democratic senators, including Hillary and Edwards, voted in favor of Bush\u2019s war resolution. He deserves credit for his prescience on this issue just as Hillary deserves credit for her support, as a private citizen, for the first Iraq war, at a time when most Democratic senators voted to oppose it. However, these actions, away from the main political stage, tell us little about the judgment the candidates will exercise when one of them becomes commander in chief on Jan. 21, 2009. \n<br><br>As Democrats, we\u2019re fortunate to have what is generally considered to be one of the strongest fields of candidates in a long time (the same can\u2019t be said of the Republicans). But now it\u2019s time to make a choice and we\u2019re down to two, maybe three candidates. Among them, only Hillary is prepared to reestablish the United States\u2019 well-respected international leadership and address the urgent challenges that face our country. \n<br><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Upasana Unni \u201911 lives in Canady Hall.

{"title": "McCain: A Leader We Can Trust | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Over the next four years, America will require the leadership of a wise, competent, and principled president. Among the presidential hopefuls, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) alone has proven himself capable of undertaking this enormous responsibility. His positions on critical issues such as terrorism, immigration, and torture reflect the wisdom that stems from a lifetime of service, and he has the moral integrity Americans can trust. \n<br><br>While other candidates are currently scrambling to appeal to their base, Sen. McCain can rely on his consistent voting record to verify his unwavering dedication to traditional conservative values. This has enabled him to\u2014more than anyone else\u2014dedicate himself to achieving real solutions for real problems, despite any political risk. He reached across the aisle to work with Democratic Senators Russ Feingold (D-Wisc.) and Edward M. Kennedy \u201954 -\u201956 (D-Mass.), respectively, to increase transparency in campaign finance and to tackle the problem of illegal immigration. Whether you look at these initiatives he\u2019s passed in his 25 years in Congress, or at the five and a half years he spent as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, it is clear that McCain has always made service to his country\u2014and not to a political party\u2014his number one priority. \n<br><br>Some on the right have surely tried to use this admirable behavior to attack his conservative credentials, but his refusal to compromise his principles for approval ratings continues to attract voters across the spectrum. Aside from his bipartisan efforts, he has consistently supported plenty of conservative legislation, such as the Gramm-Rudman Act of 1985 that cut spending to reduce the budget deficit, and the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act. \n<br><br>With this history, Conservatives can trust Sen. McCain to remain steadfast to their values, with campaign commitments to appointing judges to overturn Roe v. Wade, cutting taxes in a responsible way to promote economic growth, and securing the border and dealing with illegal immigration fairly yet compassionately. \n<br><br>Even his own opponents cannot refute that he is a true American hero and an honorable man. In this election, he has won an endorsement from Sen. Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.) and from newspapers like The Boston Globe, The Concord Monitor, The Manchester Union Leader, and The Des Moines Register. \n<br><br>Having been involved in every major foreign-policy decision over the past few decades, he certainly stands head and shoulders above his opponents in both parties as the most experienced and knowledgeable in issues that will face our next commander-in-chief.\n<br><br>Despite personal opinion on the decision to invade Iraq, the alarming rate at which casualties have been escalating is undeniable. Though it was extremely unpopular at the time, in 2006 Sen. McCain alone offered his recommendation to deploy more troops to the region. \n<br><br>Now referred to commonly as \u201cthe surge\u201d\u2014a tactic that has thus far dramatically lowered number of casualties\u2014this troop escalation has proven effective, and McCain\u2019s early criticism of Donald Rumsfeld\u2019s tactics was correct. Last year, American casualties  declined in Dec. 2007 to 23 from a peak of 121 in May 2007. This 81 percent decrease over eight months marks the lowest number of casualties since 2004. \n<br><br>Today, McCain is the only presidential candidate who can deliver an American victory in Iraq. Though cynics may snicker at the thought of victory, McCain has proven that we can trust him in matters of foreign affairs. McCain\u2019s position on foreign policy is thus an example of his excellent judgment and courage.\n<br><br>McCain also leads the Republican pack in his vocal efforts to find a solution for climate change. While other Republican candidates refuse to acknowledge that human activity has threatened our environment, he has sponsored bills to limit greenhouse gas emissions. In town hall meetings across New Hampshire, he has discussed the need to develop alternate sources of energy. He regularly inspires Republican voters\u2014who might not otherwise give this issue a second thought\u2014to recognize the danger of destroying our generation\u2019s planet and becoming entrenched in dependency on foreign oil.\n<br><br>McCain\u2019s reputation as a maverick above partisan politics is well-earned. Calling on his own experience as a prisoner of war, he has ardently opposed torture and criticized many in his own party who do not. While campaigning in Iowa, he refused to \u201cdrink his morning glass of ethanol,\u201d as he jokingly refers to other candidates\u2019 support of ethanol subsidies to pander to the Iowa constituency. Time and time again, he has come out against special interest groups and wasteful government spending, all in the name of serving the people. \n<br><br>Both conservatives as a group and Americans as a whole can trust Sen. McCain to exercise excellent judgment in promoting their interests. He has won over the country with his independent streak, relentless energy, and lifetime dedication to public service. This race has plenty of politicians, but John McCain is the only leader among them.\n<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Brenda Maldonado \u201910, an inactive Crimson news editor, is an Economics concentrator in Pforzheimer House.

More than half of the political contributions made by Harvard professors and staff in the first quarter of 2007 went to Obama, who graduated from Harvard Law School in 1991. \r\n<br><br>Katherine M.

Hillary Rodham Clindon, and former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards in the weeks leading up to the caucuses.\r\n<br><br>Like in many Iowa households, loyalties in the Thompson family were divided among various candidates. While Katherine Thompson caucused for Obama, her father served as a precinct captain for Delaware Sen.

Mike Huckabee won with 34 percent.\r\n<br><br>His closest competitor, former Mass. Gov. Mitt Romney received 25 percent, despite spending a significant amount of time in the state and donating millions of his own money to the campaign effort. Romney is a graduate of Harvard Business School and Harvard Law School.\r\n<br><br>Tim P.

{"title": "Finish Your Vote | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>I never really thought of myself as \u201cAmerican\u201d until I went abroad. I mean, sure, I am a citizen of the United States of America, but until recently I was reluctant to identify myself too closely with Uncle Sam. During the first part of my study-abroad experience, when I spoke of America, it was often with embarrassment: embarrassment about our cheesy pop music, our high pollution rates, and our Republican president. \n<br><br> But then, part-way through my summer abroad in Beijing, I found myself expounding upon \u201cunalienable rights\u201d to one of my Chinese teachers. I remember being surprised at having to explain to her what seemed to me to be such a basic concept\u2014and I realized in a flash that the Declaration of Independence spoke for me. I do in fact personally hold the truths that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, and that among these rights are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness to be, well, self-evident. \u201cHoly smokes!\u201d, I remember thinking. \u201cI\u2019m patriotic!\u201d \n<br><br>As my time out-of-country extended and I traveled to France, Spain, and Morocco, I realized just how extraordinary the United States of America is. Freedom House, an NGO that analyzes countries\u2019 comparative levels of freedom globally, correctly describes the USA as \u201cfree\u201d\u2014as a country in which citizens enjoy many political rights and civil liberties. We elect our own government. We have freedom of assembly, press, and speech. (We even, for the most part, have working toilets!)\n<br><br>While some foreign countries\u2019 citizens enjoy a level of freedom similar to that in the United States, many are not so well-off. France and Spain are also, according to Freedom House, \u201cfree\u201d countries, but Morocco is only \u201cpartly free\u201d and China is \u201cnot free.\u201d In Morocco, I learned that bars and coffee shops were \u201cfor men only\u201d and that, as a woman, it was safer never to walk into one. I met Taiwanese women in Beijing who could only speak of the China-Taiwan conflict with Americans, and even then, guardedly.\n<br><br>Somewhere in southern Spain, however, a nagging worry caught up with me. Americans\u2014particularly young Americans\u2014have democratic freedoms but don\u2019t use them. According to the web site IDEA (the Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance), in the 26 national elections since 1945, the average voter turnout rate for citizens age 18 to 24 has been only 48.3 percent. This is well below France (67.3 percent), Spain (77 percent), and even Morocco (57.6 percent). (China hasn\u2019t had comparable elections.) Americans in this age group, aptly dubbed \u201cGeneration Quiet\u201d by New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman, vote less than any other age group in the States. According to the web site civicyouth.org, in the 2006 midterm elections, while 52 percent of the adults 30 and over voted, only 22 percent of voters age 18 to 29 did. Now that\u2019s something to be embarrassed about. \n<br><br>It\u2019s not that young Americans don\u2019t take interest in current issues or hold opinions; on the contrary, according to the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research, youth tend to be both less satisfied with the status quo and more optimistic about the future than adults. When we do vote, we tend to value individual freedoms over institutional stability (think, for example, of the debate over music censorship). Yet when it comes to political participation, whether it\u2019s at the polls or through protests, we are shockingly passive. Gone is the daring sense of activism that characterized our parents\u2019 generation. Even in the Presidential election of 2004, when the youth vote surged to its highest rate ever\u201447 percent\u2014the rate still lagged well behind that of all other age groups. 2003\u2019s 200,000 person-strong march against the War in Iraq doesn\u2019t compare to the half-a-million-person 1969 and 1971 demonstrations against Vietnam . Marches on Washington Mall, it seems, have been replaced by Facebook groups and lunch counter sit-ins by Product [Red] T-shirts. \n<br><br>Now, as we begin primary season and start thinking about the 2008 presidential election, is the time to remember that we must take advantage of the political and civil liberties that we do enjoy. We further must decide how we want our generation to be remembered: as passive and nonparticipatory, or as passionate and engaged? Whether we individually choose to vote for Obama, Huckabee, Clinton, Romney, or \u201cOther,\u201d in order to prove young adults a powerful national force, we must vote. Admittedly, for Harvard students this may be less of an issue than for others (there is a positive correlation between level of education and voter turnout) but still\u2014call home. Talk to your friends. Help them to register. \n<br><br>When it comes down to it, Steven Colbert is right: I am America (And so can you!). Partisan politics aside, we citizens of the USA do commonly value freedom and democracy. I look to 2008 and hope that our next government is truly of the people, by the people and for the people\u2014and that includes of, by, and for America\u2019s youth. So go out, and cast your ballot\u2014in the name of liberty, and for every disenfranchised young person in the world who would die for the opportunity to do so him or herself.\n<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Justine R.

{"title": "Cry, The Beloved Country | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>During an unremarkable stop on the presidential campaign trail last week, Hillary Clinton was thrown what appeared to be a softball: \u201cHow do you do it? How do you keep so upbeat and wonderful?\u201d And then it happened. A catch in her voice, a gleam in her eyes\u2014was she crying? Even as Hillary spoke\u2014\u201cIt\u2019s not easy, and I couldn\u2019t do it if I didn\u2019t passionately believe it was the right thing to do\u201d\u2014you could sense the media hounds waiting to pounce. John Edwards gave his two cents, and the D.C. blogosphere bubbled with accusations of alligator tears and charges that the future leader of the free world shouldn\u2019t be so emotional. To them, Monsieur (Madame?) le President must be straight-laced and straight-faced. Anything else would be a sign of weakness.\r<br><br>Yet again, these wannabe pundits have it backward. If anything, what this political race needs is more emotion. With the airbrushed, carefully coiffed Edwards on one side and the spectacularly bland Obama on the other, it was a breath of fresh air to see the Iron Lady\u2014or anybody, for that matter\u2014do something other than flash her pearly whites for CNN.\r<br><br>In this era of personality politics, elections have devolved into debutante balls where composure and conformity win the day. The media\u2019s obsession with minutiae like laughs and wardrobe choices guarantees that even the tiniest misstep will be recorded, documented, and analyzed by Wonkette et al.  It\u2019s no wonder that campaign managers have become savvy calculators of risk micro-management. All this tiptoeing around really means, however, is that at the ballot box we\u2019ll be forced to choose between two equally shallow cardboard cutouts.\r<br><br>What we need is a candidate with fire and drive, somebody respectful of America\u2019s ideals and seasoned politically, yet bold enough to suggest drastic reform if the case calls for it. We\u2019re not going to get that kind of candidate this election. Most current contenders can be classified under the soothing moniker of \u201cmoderate\u201d; indeed, one reason Ron Paul\u2019s extreme views have found so much support is that he seems freer of the artifice that holds so many others in a tenacious grip.\r<br><br>Under the present system, a show of emotion amounts to a crack in the gleaming, vapid exterior to reveal the hopes, worries, and humanity that underlie it. It\u2019s disconcerting because although we like to admire our candidates from afar and know the intimate details of their lives, what we really want is not a personal connection but a dependable president.\r<br><br>But some of the world\u2019s best leaders, Churchill and Theodore Roosevelt included, held deep convictions of their own. They believed so passionately in their words that emotion inevitably followed. Indeed, these taboo appearances of genuine feeling have come to serve as the only indicator that a politician is anything more than a partisan mouthpiece.\r<br><br>Sure, Hillary has plenty of flaws, and her own public persona hasn\u2019t escaped the scrupulous nip-and-tuck required of all presidential hopefuls. It doesn\u2019t help that her natural temperament is only slightly warmer than a New Hampshire winter; in a college letter, she perceptively defined herself as \u201cHillary Rodham, acknowledged agnostic intellectual liberal, emotional conservative.\u201d\r<br><br>But for a brief moment in a tacky coffee shop on the campaign trail, surrounded by 16 undecided women voters and 100 television cameras, Hillary\u2019s glistening eyes offered a moment of revelation. Politics should be dynamic and complex, honest, and irreducible to simple stereotypes. The same thing goes for our next president.\r<br><br> <br><br>Jessica A.

{"title": "She's Not a Robot! | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Pundits should probably just pack it in. They were wrong about Senator John McCain (R.-Ariz.) when they pronounced his campaign dead a few months ago. They were wrong (twice) about Senator Barack Obama (D-Ill.) when they thought he could never win Iowa and then thought he could never lose New Hampshire. They were wrong about Senator Hillary Clinton\u2019s (D-N.Y.) ability to rebound after Iowa. They failed to understand former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee\u2019s surge. They have pretty much been wrong about the entire process. \n<br><br>As an opinion columnist on the elections, however, I might be placed into the \u201cpundit\u201d category, and I certainly wouldn\u2019t want to upset the apple cart. So, allow me to opine for a moment.\n<br><br>Don\u2019t let New Hampshire results convince you otherwise; America\u2019s conception of leadership is still very sexist. Why was it a huge deal that Hillary cried on Monday? Why do female politicians have to keep their hair cut short? When was the last time a female leader wore a skirt or dress?\n<br><br>Though it\u2019s hard to know what actually goes through someone\u2019s head when he or she casts a vote or makes a statement, I would venture to say that Hillary was a champion of the War in Iraq at the beginning\u2014and has since refused to acknowledge that her vote was a mistake\u2014in part because she needs to appear strong and decisive as a female candidate.\n<br><br>Maybe Clinton has been forced to appear robotic and calculated because of the old double standard: Were she to show emotion the same way her husband did (cue lip bite, squint, statement of empathy), voters would discount her as too weak to be president.\n<br><br>Try to think of any female political leader who actually did speak in soaring political rhetoric like Obama, or who used personal anecdotes the way Senator John Edwards does. \n<br><br>Can\u2019t? Though I don\u2019t doubt Obama has more natural charisma than Hillary, could she effectively use whatever charm she might have and still appear presidential? Who was the last female political leader able to inspire the masses? Barbara Jordan never had broad nationwide appeal. Eleanor Roosevelt never ran for office in her own right. Indira Gandhi, Golda Meir, Margaret Thatcher, Mary Robinson, and Benazir Bhutto might have been described as inspirational, but mostly as a result of their strength of character and iron will in the face of war and other major crises. \n<br><br>Once Hillary proved her mettle as a tough lady, the pendulum swung the other way and she is now seen as cold, mechanical, and uncaring. \n<br><br>When she cried on Monday, the first question to be raised was whether or not it was genuine. In the aftermath, however, almost every news story characterized the moment as a meltdown. Headlines read \u201cHillary Clinton Gets Emotional.\u201d It was compared to Former Vermont Governor Howard Dean\u2019s \u201cscream\u201d in 2004, and to Senator Ed Muskie\u2019s \u201cemotional moment\u201d in the 1972 New Hampshire primary. \n<br><br>After she won the N.H. primary, pundits were quick to point to her emotional moment as the reason for the upset victory. Maureen Dowd\u2019s column the morning after the primary was titled, \u201cCan Hillary Cry Her Way Back to the White House?\u201d It was said that middle-aged and older women, who formed 57 percent of the voters in the Democratic primary\u2014and who voted for her 46 percent to 34 percent over Obama\u2014were touched by the moment and upset about the extra scrutiny Hillary has received as a woman. \n<br><br>The pundits are probably wrong again. Clinton won New Hampshire because she was able to turn out the traditional Democratic base in her favor. She won self-identified Democrats, low-income voters, older voters, Catholic voters, urban and suburban voters, voters from union families, and voters who felt financially stressed. \n<br><br>In the end, I wonder why Hillary has been able to do so well in the first place. Sure she\u2019s smart, has a decent amount of experience, and has proven herself a capable senator. \n<br><br>But the same thing could be said for Senator Chris Dodd, Senator Joe Biden, and Governor Bill Richardson. But she is atop the polls while the others are mere footnotes in this election. Similarly, John Edwards has great name recognition after his 2004 run, about the same amount of experience as Clinton, and is seen as more likable by most voters, but his demise is fairly certain.\n<br><br>I\u2019d argue that Hillary is a front-runner because she\u2019s a woman. Name recognition from her years in the White House certainly helps, but ultimately the media has focused on her from day one (like Obama) because of the historic potential of her candidacy. Women form the majority of voters in the primary and general elections. Women are seen as more able to deal with problems of health care and education. Perhaps it is simply her connection to her husband, widely seen as a better president than Bush, and the nostalgia associated with those years that has propelled her candidacy, but if she were a man, I just don\u2019t think she would be a contender. \n<br><br>So don\u2019t cry for Hillary just yet. It may be this unjust sexist world we live in that is keeping her strong in this election.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Islam\u2019s Role in the Elections | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Throughout the 2008 presidential elections, several candidates have sought to utilize anti-Islam prejudices to their advantage.  <br><br>In January of 2007, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s campaign team deliberately turned the public\u2019s attention to Senator Barack Hussein Obama\u2019s Muslim heritage in order to harm his popularity.  Obama, in turn, worked very hard to distance himself from any past or present affiliation with Muslims and Islam, citing the Bible in his speeches and emphasizing his personal relationship with Jesus Christ.  <br><br>Republicans, for their part, haven\u2019t been much better. Formulaic prefaces from candidates about how \u201cthe enemy\u201d is radical Islam hardly veil more broad based, antagonistic sentiments they harbor against Muslims generally. The Christian Science Monitor, for example, reported that Mitt Romney discounted out-of-hand the possibility of appointing a Muslim to his cabinet, were he to take office. In a recent speech to Republicans in New Hampshire, Mike Huckabee, speaking about energy reform and US reliance on foreign oil, stated, \u201cWe [will] no longer let the Middle Eastern people hold us hostage, wrecking our economy as well our environment.\u201d More to the point, John Deady, co-chair of Veterans for Rudy, said: \u201c[Rudy Giuliani] has got, I believe, the knowledge and the judgment to attack one of the most difficult problems in current history, and that is the rise of the Muslims.  <br><br>\u201cMake no mistake about it,\u201d he continued, \u201cThis hasn\u2019t happened for a thousand years. These people are very, very dedicated. They\u2019re also very smart in their own way, and we need to keep the feet to the fire and keep pressing these people until we defeat them or chase them back to their caves, or, in other words, get rid of them.\u201d  <br><br>Islam is not antithetical to all things American. Yet, rather than try to build bridges and work towards engagement and understanding, since September 11, 2001 politicians have preferred to exploit people\u2019s insecurities and biases in order to stoke fears about the supposed threat that Muslims pose to free and democratic societies.  The ubiquity of anti-Muslim attitudes in American political rhetoric, even if it is only implicit, not only alienates Muslims around the world, but emboldens intolerant sects of American society. So far, this strategy has sadly shown itself to be politically successful. Being perceived as sympathetic towards Islam and Muslims is taken as evidence of spineless foreign policy where intolerance and fiery diatribes are to a candidate\u2019s credit.<br><br>Is this the sort of America we want to live in?  How can a nation founded on the precepts of equality and tolerance elect leaders in part based on their perceived ability to malign a religion that over one-sixth of the world\u2019s population subscribes to? <br><br>Many Americans, as a result, have developed the false sense that Islam and the West are destined to clash.  This misconception of a binary opposition that hawkish politicians use to paint the picture of the current balance of world power allows politicians to sell an overly simplistic picture of America\u2019s interaction with the Muslim world. By reducing America\u2019s relationship to the rest of the world to such black and white terms, politicians are able to derive power as crusaders against a perceived sinister force. <br><br>One only needs to watch the recent campaign ads to see these themes pandered to the masses. One such ad, approved by Giuliani, depicts a violent, irrational, out of control Muslim world. The voiceover forebodingly declares, \u201can enemy without borders,\u201d and, \u201ca people perverted,\u201d in sync with footage of crowds of Muslims, fire, and explosions .This is all set to unearthly, frightening background music. The message is quite clear: Muslims are evil and they\u2019re coming to get you. The ad ends with a case for Giuliani as the strong and capable defender of America: \u201cIn a world when the next crisis is a moment away, America needs a leader who\u2019s ready.\u201d <br><br>Such dramatic presentations create an artificial sense of unquestioned moral authority, where America and its interests constitute the \u201cgood guys\u201d and everyone else is the \u201cbad guys,\u201d resulting in a populace that desires leaders who will take strong action against an evil force. <br><br>This sort of demonizing, hate-filled rhetoric is discrimination at its worst. Pitting voters against an illusory common enemy both abroad and at home, campaigners are jeopardizing the safety of six to seven million Muslim, who live among other Americans who are increasingly likely to perceive them as a threat. In doing so, campaigners are compromising the values upon which this nation was founded.  Wasn\u2019t this country established by individuals who sought refuge from the religious oppression that pervaded their homelands?  Are we not a nation that takes pride in its diversity and inclusiveness?  By allowing presidential campaigns to antagonize a minority group within our population, we as Americans are not fulfilling our duty to safeguard the values of equality and tolerance our predecessors fought for.<br><br><br><br>Sadia Ahsanuddin \u201909 is administrative editor of \u201cAscent Magazine: Harvard and MIT Students on Islam and Society,\u201d and is a history concentrator in Dunster House.

{"title": "Obama for Democratic Nominee | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>On Tuesday, Feb. 5, Democrats in 22 states, including Massachusetts, will go to the polls to select the Democratic Party\u2019s nominee for President of the United States. We hope they select Sen. Barack H. Obama. He has won our unmitigated support because he has the experience, policy proposals, and vision required not only to be president, but to fundamentally alter the way our broken political system functions.<br><br>Obama has committed his life to furthering the public good. From starting as a community organizer, to working as a constitutional lawyer and law professor, to serving as a Ill. State Senator, and, finally, as an United States Senator, Obama has achieved before the age of fifty what many would aspire to do in a lifetime. The judgment and perspective he has acquired in these roles are qualities that are necessary in a leader, particularly at the highest levels of government, where elected officials are inundated with questions with profound and lasting repercussions. <br><br>On issues of substance, Obama has assembled an impressive array of policies that demonstrate careful thought about the immediate problems facing our country today and those that we will encounter in the long term. Although we do not agree with all of Obama\u2019s proposals, every one of his plans is informed, carefully crafted, and thoughtfully considered.<br><br>Obama\u2019s healthcare program, for instance, guarantees universal healthcare for minors but allows adults to choose whether they are covered. Although we believe that complete universal healthcare is an important policy for our country to aspire to, Obama\u2019s plan reaches towards that goal. Its significant efforts to subsidize and provide and universal access to all Americans is unparalleled in the Democratic field, and, perhaps, represents the most pragmatic solution.<br><br>While all the major Democratic candidates propose changes in the tax code that will work to rollback tax cuts instituted by President George W. Bush, Obama\u2019s proposals stand out because they are targeted to varied and specific populations that need relief the most. These include tax reform for the middle class, tax relief for the poor, universal mortgage credits, tax credits up to $4,000 for college students, and the elimination of income tax for senior citizens earning less than $50,000 per year. This type of targeted, creative relief is exactly what America needs.<br><br>Obama also has a practical approach to dealing with immigration. His proposals adhere to the basic formula we believe is best: reducing shoring up boarders and reducing the incentives to immigrate illegally while bringing undocumented workers already in the country out of the shadows with a demanding path to citizenship. While Obama is in favor of increasing border enforcement beyond what we feel is necessary\u2014for instance he voted for a border fence\u2014we recognize that limiting the flow of illegal immigrants is a political prerequisite to immigration reform. Finally, we support Obama\u2019s commitment to expanding the number of high-skill immigrants to our country through to the H-1B visa program.<br><br>To help reduce carbon emissions and help fight climate change, Obama proposes a cap-and-trade system and the corresponding reduction of emissions to 80 percent below the 1990 levels by 2050. Vaulting the U.S. into a leadership position on climate change is a goal that should figure prominently in any presidential candidate\u2019s decision-making. Obama has shown that he cares about the issue and will take it to the White House as a high priority if elected. <br><br>Obama cares deeply about education, and he has a holistic plan to reform the entire system, from infant healthcare through higher education. Highlights of his plan include reforming No Child Left Behind, addressing the high rate of dropouts, and quadrupling funding for Early Head Start programs that form the youngest generation of students. We believe Obama\u2019s emphasis on increased funding for public education and his tax credit for higher education are prime steps to take in addressing our nation\u2019s educational woes. <br><br>Finally, but perhaps most importantly, we wholeheartedly support Obama\u2019s opposition to the war in Iraq. Obama has consistently taken a stand against the war since its inception, and his commitment to bringing the troops home is commendable. Obama has the vision and know how to lead our nation out of the conflagration in Iraq as smoothly as possible and in a way that begins to restore our international standing and credibility.<br><br>Various critics have voiced concerns that Obama is too ambitious and inexperienced to be the next president of the United States. We disagree. Obama\u2019s candidacy reflects a lack of political maneuvering and instead is based on a desire to see dramatic change in the political system. And what Sen. Obama might lack in political experience, he makes up with sound judgment, intelligence, charisma, and a personable and bipartisan demeanor. Furthermore, in office he will surround himself with some of the smartest and most experienced advisors in the world. <br><br>Obama represents an opportunity for a Democratic nominee who represents the value of service, intelligence, and judgment, and, most of all, an opportunity for real change, unburdened by favors owed and ideals lost. He deserves your vote.</span></p>"}

{"title": "The James Dean Effect | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>On a break from thesising late this January, I opened my web browser to The New York Times Web site and was greeted by chills running down my spine. Tucked away on the bottom-right corner of the screen, below headlines about flailing financial markets and the South Carolina primaries were the puzzling words: \u201cHeath Ledger Found Dead.\u201d\n<br><br>I think it\u2019s fair to say that many members of my generation who grew up alongside \u201c10 Things I Hate About You,\u201d \u201cA Knight\u2019s Tale,\u201d and \u201cBrokeback Mountain\u201d were thrown into shock. The news spread remarkably fast by text message, email, and Facebook post, and for days the actor\u2019s tragic passing featured prominently in almost all of my conversations with friends. \n<br><br>A recurring theme of these conversations was how strangely significant the loss had been to us\u2014this was the first time in our memory that we had lost a movie star. Heath Ledger was our Marilyn Monroe, our James Dean. He had joined the regretful ranks of stars immortalized by their premature deaths.\n<br><br>Why is it, one of my friends wondered the other night, as we passed around the issue of Entertainment Weekly whose glossy cover featured Ledger\u2019s face, that he is sure to be remembered decades from now while he might have slipped into obscurity had he lived a full life?\n<br><br>That question got me thinking: Ledger only performed a few critically acclaimed roles (\u201cMonster\u2019s Ball,\u201d \u201cBrokeback Mountain,\u201d \u201cCandy,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m Not There\u201d), and yet all those who now remember him recall a unique if not unparalleled talent. Rob Reiner\u2019s reflection best captures the feeling of loss: \u201cIt\u2019s a real tragedy when someone so talented dies, because you don\u2019t know on the early part of their career what more they could offer us.\u201d\n<br><br>James Dean only had three movie roles before he died at age 24 (two of them released after his death), and yet he was quickly canonized as a transcendent talent: He was nominated posthumously for two Best Actor Oscars, and The American Film Institute ranked him 18th on their list of the greatest stars of American cinema \u2014 ahead of legends like the Marx Brothers and actors like Burt Lancaster and William Holden, who won Oscars and earned many more nominations.\n<br><br>The common thread of these losses is that of potential. We don\u2019t know whether Dean would ever have replicated his early success, or whether Ledger would have turned in another performance like his turn as Ennis Del Mar in Brokeback Mountain. Early death solidifies an actor\u2019s trajectory at the beginning of its upward arc\u2014we are a culture obsessed with what could have been\u2014and so it is no wonder that James Dean\u2019s face adorns many dorm room walls.\n<br><br>Ledger\u2019s death unexpectedly helps explain a seemingly unrelated phenomenon: the meteoric rise of Barack Obama\u2019s popularity amongst my generation. Why is it that droves of young voters (and kids too young to vote) flock to Obama? \n<br><br>Much like James Dean\u2019s reputation rests on three great movies, Obama\u2019s rests on three (arguably) great years in the Senate. He is young and, as his opponents charge, relatively inexperienced. But in addition to being a potential liability, this freshness is also his greatest asset. For the masses of formerly apathetic youth looking for a clarion call of hope\u2014voters unlikely to educate themselves about policy positions\u2014the worst thing a candidate can have is baggage. The absence of baggage allows us to project whatever we want onto the candidate: he believes what I believe, he will make the change that I want made. And why not? I have no evidence to the contrary.\n<br><br>The key issue of \u201cbaggage\u201d pops up again and again on Facebook pages and YouTube videos in support of Obama. On the message board of the Facebook page where students declare that they are a \u201csupporter\u201d of Obama (there are almost 600,000), Towson University student John Kyriacou wrote recently \u201cYou fail to notice that both senator[s] have basically the same platform and ideas to improve our country. The only difference is that Sen. Obama has a lot less baggage.\u201d\n<br><br> \u201cNo Baggage\u201d is a good euphemism for lack of concrete data on which to pass judgement. Because Obama is a relative unknown, he can represent all forms of hope and change to all people. As a poster commented on Obama\u2019s YouTube response to Bush\u2019s last State of the Union Address: \u201cLets all remember that it was Obama that brought about the campaign of Hope and Change. I have never been this excited about the posibility of true political change. It\u2019s time to fundamentally change this country\u2019s government, to have have it working for its people again! Viva la Revolution!! Viva la Revolution indeed. The change Obama represents to this commentator likely does not resemble the change he represents to his upper-middle class, highly-educated supporters (his most reliable voters in the primaries) who are, I imagine, not looking for revolution. But because of our collective charitableness towards unknown quantities\u2014be they movie stars who died too young or politicians with scant records (and, in the case of John F. Kennedy, both)\u2014Barack Obama may be able to ride the James Dean Effect all the way to the Democratic nomination and the White House. And, in the meantime, he\u2019ll find himself on dorm room walls to boot.\n<br><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Ryder B.

{"title": "Olden Times | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>These bright modern times can be a little gloomy for the \u201cGrey Lady\u201d of journalism, otherwise known as The New York Times. First off, she\u2019s getting older, and a little lonelier\u2014former subscribers screening her calls as the rest of the industry\u2019s circulation dives, both hometown readership and stock plunging like the Andrea Doria (which she remembers). Yes, she\u2019s gussied herself up for the kids online, but it\u2019s not the same; video just feels wrong. Her pride is intact, to be sure, with most of her reputation, but we\u2019re dealing with a lady who has seen better days\u2014and she knows it.\r\n<br><br>Take yesterday\u2019s expos\u00e9 on John McCain\u2019s political-careerful of indiscretions small and large. The probable Republican nominee for president and historically, McCain apparently didn\u2019t let his self-styled reputation as the Senate\u2019s most adamant ethics watchdog slow him down when Rupert Murdoch and Michael Bloomberg offered him a plane ride. The Arizona senator\u2014who is becoming more and more like his constituency with each passing year\u2014was celebrated when he helped birth the Reform Institute, a nonprofit organization dedicated to keeping corporate money out of American politics; that same senator didn\u2019t see a problem with his pet project enjoying the benefits of, yes, corporate money\u2014apparently piles of it.\r\n<br><br>Instead of being a story about McCain screwing the proverbial pooch, though, much of the article\u2019s same-day fallout seems to have been directed at its publisher. In its infinite wisdom the Times ran the piece bookended with the nebulous claims that the candidate had had an affair with a lobbyist; both supposed parties denied these claims, though. What\u2019s more, these allegations were the only new information in the story. \r\n<br><br>Some cried sensationalism; others felt that the longstanding claims that the Times staff is a hyperliberal cabal had been vindicated. One disillusioned conservative wrote: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with investigative reporting, especially on presidential candidates, but it doesn\u2019t seem that this investigation produced anything substantive.\u201d Another offered something more incisive: \u201crush limbagh [sic] is right.\u201d \r\n<br><br>Frankly, it\u2019s fairly obvious that the expos\u00e9 was handled badly; it was a vitriolic indictment masquerading as a feature news story, trashy tabloid fodder dressed in the garb of journalistic legitimacy\u2014in short, not very ladylike.\r\n<br><br>Even as the Times demeans itself to entertain the blogosphere for a moment, it also apparently yearns for its glory days. Its eccentric brand of nostalgia is manifest: until the McCain story hit the Web, sitting atop the website\u2019s \u201cMost Emailed\u201d list was a story about \u201ccelebrating the semicolon\u201d on a subway poster. The piece, beginning with this most banal of leads, develops into a disconcerting death knell for the richer punctuation of yesteryear: prominent lefties like Noam Chomsky wax elegiac and crack wise about grammar, the implicit assumption being that people under seventy see the semi-colon and think, \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with that comma?\u201d \r\n<br><br>So the estimable Gray Lady has slipped a bit: she\u2019s sometimes unreliable and sometimes a little weird. We must see, though: it didn\u2019t used to be this way! She was a nice girl! For proof we need only turn to the Times itself, at the start of its original salad days, just before the turn of the century. In an October 1897 article, George P. Rowell explains the paper\u2019s sudden success. Instead of cutting rate, the staff upped the ante with a \u201cstrict insistence upon absolutely trustworthy and impartial news reports, and a rigid maintenance of its apt motto, \u2018All the news that\u2019s fit to print.\u2019\u201d The effect on circulation was undeniable, and it proved to Rowell and the world \u201cwhat may be accomplished by a clean, progressive newspaper.\u201d One hopes that now, as newsprint\u2019s future seems uncertain, its graceful matriarch won\u2019t change her ways.\r\n<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">James M.

Moses gave his audience a lesson in constitutional history yesterday, tracing the expansion of American civil rights from the founding fathers to Barack Obama\u2019s presidential campaign.\r<br><br>Speaking at the Institute of Politics, Moses described early interpretations of the U.S. constitution designed to protect the rights of slaveowners, and outlined the way in which reformers from Abraham Lincoln to the activists of the 1960s had attempted to expand the notion of constitutional rights, a process he said was still not finished.\r<br><br>\u201cWe should embrace the constitutional reach of \u2018we,\u2019\u201d said Moses, a former Harvard graduate student. \r<br><br>\u201cWe need to make good on our claim of \u2018we the people.\u2019\u201d\r<br><br>Moses added that he saw Obama\u2019s campaign\u2014and the debate it has sparked over whether America is ready for a black president\u2014as the continued expansion of the Constitution to include all Americans.\r<br><br>When asked by an audience member about the state of public education in America, Moses turned the question around, asking audience members to raise their hands if they would support a constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right to an education.\r<br><br>\u201cWith regards to education, we are not citizens of this country,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no federal right to education.\u201d \r<br><br>Moses was the keynote speaker at the Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s Public Policy and Leadership Conference, which brings college students to the school to encourage careers in public service.\r<br><br>As a member of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in the 1960s, Moses led voter registration drives in the deep south. \r<br><br>In 1982, he founded the Algebra Project, a progressive math education program for low-income students that has been put in place in around 40,000 American middle schools. \r<br><br>Currently, he teaches math in Miami, Fla.\r<br><br>The civil rights leader only mentioned his own career in the question-and-answer session following the speech, when a former student asked him how he believed his role as an educator had furthered civil rights. Moses said that he saw education as a crucial step in expanding rights. \r<br><br>\u201cThere is nothing radical about voter registration. But bringing voter registration to Mississippi sharecroppers, that was radical,\u201d he said. \r<br><br>\u201cDoing math isn\u2019t radical. But teaching kids in the bottom quartile as part of a larger political and cultural process, that\u2019s radical.\u201d\r<br><br>Despite the theoretical tone of his address, Moses said that the key to social change lies in individual hands-on initiatives, the sort he said formed the basis of the civil rights movement. \r<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s about the struggle to close the gap between what America preaches and what it practices,\u201d he said.\r<br><br>\u2014Staff writer Cora K.

{"title": "In Defense of Pig Farmers | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Today, droves of urbane politicos and journalists will check out of the Des Moines Ramada with their business settled, and stage their escape from flyover country (at least until 2011). Many will kiss the grimy concrete at LaGuardia, glad to be back in the impersonal murk of a \u2018real city.\u2019 While the frenzied, all-or-nothing theatricality of these early electoral contests would appear to be the product of willful collaboration between the media, the candidates themselves, and their voting public, many complicit city-folk remain dissatisfied: if only the stage were set in a more cultured locale.\r<br><br>For those Americans with an ocean view\u2014and the inflated sense of self that comes with it\u2014the two-month drone of pre-caucus news from landlocked, lumpy Iowa draws more than a little ire. The same lament comes up over seared ahi again and again, from the Hamptons to La Jolla: Why should a few pig farmers decide who gets to be president?\r<br><br>I, suburbanite, felt myself slipping last week into precisely this rut as I watched a man in plaid saying, yes, he planned to caucus, as long as he could catch a bowl game around noon. This fellow, to whom circumstance had bequeathed great decisive power, was prepared to allow one among a plethora of meaningless college football tournaments (who even wants to win the Chick-fil-A Bowl?) to disrupt his participation in representative government. \u2018Yokel\u2019 is not a term to be thrown around carelessly, but sometimes a situation demands it.\r<br><br>But just before I launched into that same tirade about bib overalls that is bouncing around Bill Maher\u2019s head at this very moment, I caught myself. Someone has to have first look at this slippery field of candidates, to be the testing ground and focus group to their gladhanding and hyper-scripted stump speeches. Meanwhile, so many of our states lack the economic or cultural grandeur of California or New York and become little more than whistle-stops in the general election. This is, of course, the problem to which the Electoral College is the hapless, nonsensical solution.\r<br><br>Better that the self-styled salt of the earth in Dubuque and Davenport fill that role when the time to vote finally arrives than that same Geffen-and-Soros cabal that donates millions in the months beforehand and afterward. If there\u2019s one thing keeping the race for the White House from becoming one long black-tie fundraiser in a polished banquet hall, it\u2019s these people. Better that some frustrated rustics scrape the barrel for Huckabee\u2019s aw-shucks ticket and the remains of the McCain campaign than Republicans elsewhere resign themselves to the twin metropolitan miseries of Mssrs. Giuliani and Romney.\r<br><br>I stop short of ascribing Iowans the kind of preternatural polygraphic capacity that many of their number use to justify their place in the voting order. Generally, if Minnesotans have a robust tradition of mocking your obtuseness, the case for your superlative statewide discernment becomes a tough sell. \r<br><br>Fundraising numbers alone attest to the fact that the presidential campaigns we\u2019re witnessing have become sickeningly well-oiled and potent political machines, with the newspapers and cable news channels hovering nearby, awestruck and totally indulgent sidekicks. As these behemoths prepare to churn their way through the big coastal cities, gathering cash and celebrity endorsements over the course of 2008, at the very least we can make them start their year slowed to a crawl and under scrutiny in a Dubuque diner. Thank heaven for hayseeds.\r<br><br> <br><br>James M. Larkin \u201910, a Crimson editorial editor, is a social studies concentrator in Quincy House.</span></p>"}
