{"title": "SONIC ATTACK | Arts | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>S</b>ONIC YOUTH'S LATEST ALBUM, <i>Dirty,</i> probably won't be very popular at Harvard. It's brash. It's loud. It's unconventional. And it sounds nothing like Steve Miller, James Taylor or U2.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard students' bland tastes aside, <i>Dirty</i> is one the best things to happen to music this year. The disc features fifteen songs of raw energy, biting political commentary and visceral passion captured superbly by Butch Vig, the producer of Nirvana's last album. It ranks with <i>Daydream Nation</i> as one of Sonic Youth's best releases.</span></p> <p><span>Thurston Moore, singer and guitarist for the band, brings his instrument to a new level on this record. His guitar crashes, wavers, floats, oozes, jives, jitters, screams and howls--sometimes all in the same song. His voice is equally versatile.</span></p> <p><span>\"100%,\" the first song on the album and the only one you'll hear on the radio, opens with a couple of raging guitars screeching in each channel. The ensuing kick-ass chord progression, penetrating drums and wailing guitars guide Moore's voice for just over two minutes. \"I've been around the world a million times,\" he admits, \"And all men are slime.\"</span></p> <p><span>In the scorching \"Wish Fulfillment,\" things start off relatively quietly with light guitars adorning Moore's slow melody: \"I see your wishes on the wall/And that's all right with me/I see you run to make a call/ Hoping that there's someone free/Your life and my life, they don't touch at all/ And that's no way to be/I've never seemed so far.\" Immediately, a wall of guitars crashes down on Moore's serene voice and he begins to roar. After a chaotic minute, the quietude of the first part returns, and the cycle repeats itself.</span></p> <p><span>The next song, \"Sugar Kane,\" alternates Sonic Youth's trademark minor up-down chord progression with guitar free-for-alls--complete with requisite distortion and ample feedback. Moore's voice complements it all well.</span></p> <p><span>Singer-bassist Kim Gordon is at her irreverent best in the pulsating \"Shoot\" and \"Swimsuit Issue.\" In the later, a loud ballad condemning sexual harrassment, Gordon squeals \"I ain't giving you head/In a sunset bungalow\" before belting out a dozen women's names and eerily murmuring \"I'm swimming.\"</span></p> <p><span>More political messages are provided in \"Youth Against Fascism,\" an all out attack on the Republican adminstration. \"I believe Anita Hill/The judge will rot in hell,\" Moore yells. His evaluation of Bush's re-election prospects? \"Yeah, the President sucks/His shit is out of luck.\"</span></p> <p><span>One of the more accessible intros on the album--a fairly conventional guitar line sans distortion--launches \"Chapel Hill,\" a piece that speeds into a frenzy as it brutally mocks the \"terrorized face\" of a certain North Carolina senator and his Klan connections. \"Jesse H. coming to our pit,\" Moore quips, \"All ages show.\"</span></p> <p><span>Sonic Youth's new album is all about being young, loud, and free. The music--and that message--won't appeal to many people at Harvard. But Sonic Youth hasn't become one of America's most important bands of the past decade by trying to satisfy everyone.</span></p>"}

Riley, coordinator of Students for Braun at the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana, \"A lot of [college students] tell me that they are voting only to vote for Carol Moseley Braun.\" Riley also noted that Braun's name recognition has reached an astonishing 90 percent in Illinois.</span></p> <p><span>Why such overwhelming support? In addition to being in the right place at the right time last spring, her years of experience in Illinois politics and a charismatic, plain-speaking style, Braun won national celebrity because of her potential to become the first Black woman in the Senate.</span></p> <p><span>Checks poured in from across the country, and a campaign that had been plagued by disorganization and lack of funds took off. Suddenly, Braun was everywhere, prompting one enthusiastic downstate Democratic committee chair to claim, \"I predict that Clinton will be pulled to victory [in Illinois] by Carol Braun's coattails.\"</span></p> <p><span>This somewhat hyperbolic claim was only affirmed by the national media. In August, Braun appeared on the front page of the New York Times embracing Clinton at a Democratic rally.</span></p> <p><span>Like Clinton, she rolls through the state in her \"Carolvan\" bus. And like a rock star, she autographs bumperstickers. But is she more than just a celebrity?</span></p> <p><span>Her down-to-earth style is usually enough to convince voters that she can take a stand. Braun strongly criticized Bush's abortion policy in an address to students at Western Illinois University: \"They wanted to give you freedom to make choices in your life and yet they want to get into your bedroom and tell you whether or not you can get pregnant.\"</span></p> <p><span>But Braun's main concerns are the Illinois and national economies. Taking a jab at Republicans, Braun says \"The greatest family value is employment.\" She wants to rebuild Illinois' infrastructure and create a single-payer health care system.</span></p> <p><span>She is also a strong advocate of education reform. Braun often cites education as the catalyst of her rise from a working class background to the Illinois General Assembly and the Cook County Recorder of Deeds.</span></p> <p><span>Although Braun is not irreproachable--she delivered an uninspiring speech at the Democratic convention--her popularity seems unassailable.</span></p> <p><span>Recently, her opponent, Republican Chicago attorney Rich Williamson, attempted to link her to Gus Savage--a lame-duck Illinois Representative who gained notoriety for anti-Semitic remarks.</span></p> <p><span>But Braun, who is far from anti-Semitic and is in fact a strong supporter of Israel, didn't even get a chance to defend herself. Numerous local columnists, writer Studs Terkel and Senator Paul Simon leapt to her defense, lambasting Williamson's tactics.</span></p> <p><span>Comparing Willamson to a \"punch-drunk prize fighter who has lost every round to a better opponent,\" Terkel said, \"it's the last round and he hasn't a ghost of a chance of winning unless he hits foul punches.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "All the World's a Stage | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b><i>The Fourth Wall</i></b></span></p> <p><span>written by A.R. Gurney, directed by David Saint</span></p> <p><span>at the Hasty Pudding</span></p> <p><span>A.R. Gurney came to Cambridge last week seeking feedback on <i>The Fourth Wall,</i> his new play at the Hasty Pudding Theatre.</span></p> <p><span><i>The Fourth Wall</i> radically departs from Gurney's typical romantic comedy. Straying from the genre which bore such successes as <i>The Dining Room and Love Letters,</i> Gurney ventures into the world of the postmodern.</span></p> <p><span>The play opens as Roger (Tony Roberts) and Julia (Kelly Bishop), discuss the \"fourth wall.\"</span></p> <p><span>In the world of theater, as Andre Antoine's quote states in the program, \"the fourth wall is the name we give to the hypothetical wall that separates the stage from the audience in a proscenium theatre.\"</span></p> <p><span>But, for Roger and Julia, the fourth wall is literally the fourth wall of Roger's apartment which his wife Peggy (E. Katherine Kerr) has chosen to leave absolutely bare. Disturbed by the blankness of the wall, Roger and Julia declare that they feel like they are being watched, as if they were in a play.</span></p> <p><span>Gurney establishes his meta-theatrical premise and then proceeds to make the audience aware of the contrivance of his play and of the medium in general. Roger and Julia discuss how their actions contribute to the plot and talk about wanting to \"have scenes\" with other characters.</span></p> <p><span>In order to understand in what direction their \"play\" is going, Peggy and Roger call in Floyd, a theater professor from NYU.</span></p> <p><span>Floyd, played masterfully by Jack Gilpin, is a caricature of an academic. He lives through the plays he studies. Despite his impressive knowledge of drama, Floyd's inability to be part of the adult world is clear when he announces shamefully that he still wets his bed.</span></p> <p><span>The introduction of the pretentious bedwetter has interesting possibilities, but the play runs dry. The idea of characters figuring out their own play has been done before.</span></p> <p><span>Like Beckett's \"Waiting for Godot,\" the play consists of far more waiting than plot. When Julia says, \"We've been sitting here for 20 minutes and we haven't got to the plot,\" she could not have read the audience's mind better.</span></p> <p><span>Gurney strives to keep the audience entertained through his trademark witty dialogue, and often succeeds. When Julia begins a story, \"I have a friend....,\" Floyd cuts her off in a snotty voice, \"I seriously doubt that.\"</span></p> <p><span>Gurney also uses Cole Porter songs in an effort to keep the play moving. However wonderful the songs may be, they do not fit well with the rest of the play. Although each final note evoked applause from the audience, the songs detract from the cohesiveness of <i>\"The Fourth Wall.\"</i></span></p> <p><span>Gurney has a distinct beginning and end, but the rest of the play seems like filler. In order to have some plot other than what the four characters will do about the fourth wall, Gurney creates the subplot of a possible affair between Roger and Julia. But Peggy is not worried enough about Roger and Julia to intervene when they are locked in the bedroom together. Although Gurney does create some suspense with the possibility of the affair, he thwarts it and renders it meaningless.</span></p> <p><span>By making the affair plot unimportant, Gurney mocks tv shows and movies which do revolve around such typical plots. In fact, Gurney takes several stabs at sitcoms.</span></p> <p><span>Another target of Gurney's comic attack is George Bush. Peggy gives a speech that Clinton campaign advisors would have loved. But like the Cole Porter songs, the speech would be good in another context, but it does not jibe well with the rest of the play.</span></p> <p><span>In his talk with Harvard students sponsored by Harvard's Office for the Arts, Gurney said he was trying to make a political statement with <i>The Fourth Wall.</i></span></p> <p><span>When asked what he was trying to do with Peggy's speech, Gurney replied that it was a \"slash across the canvas.\" But the slash does not come across as a bold political statement; rather, it jars the feeling of the play.</span></p> <p><span>Although Gurney does not quite achieve his goal of writing a forceful political play, he does successfully challenge the constraints of the medium of the play.</span></p> <p><span>In the program, Gurney writes, \"I myself have been writing plays of one kind or another for almost forty years, and more and more I find myself prowling around this cell I have put myself in, testing its possibilities, and at least pretending to cherish its restrictions.\"</span></p> <p><span><i>The Fourth Wall</i> is more about drama than it is about anything else. Gurney fills the play with allusions to playwrights ranging from Aristophanes and Sophocles to Shakespeare, Beckett, and Pirandello. The script would make a good final for a drama survey course if the professor asked the students to identify and discuss all the allusions.</span></p> <p><span><i>The Fourth Wall</i> may not be a masterpiece but it does further the postmodern tradition, signifying a personal breakthrough for A.R. Gurney.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Congress Repeals Tax On Scholarship Money | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The U.S. Senate on this week approved 70-29 a bill that includes a measure designed to repeal a 1986 law allowing the taxation of financial aid. President Bush is likely to veto it, however.</span></p> <p><span>At issue is a law that allows for the taxation of scholarship and grant monies that exceed $17,000 and are used for room, board, travel and any expenses other than tuition. The law affects roughly one-fifth of Harvard students who receive financial aid.</span></p> <p><span>Last March, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) required Harvard to turn over the financial aid records of 3500 former and current students.

{"title": "Time Warp | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>N</b>early two decades after the final peace accords, it is almost impossible to think of the Vietnam War in any terms but its ironies. The isolated stories are so horrifying--My Lai, \"Friendly fire,\" the idea that we could burn a village to save it--that we rarely get a chance to concentrate on the war as a whole event. Instead, the ironies tell their own story, cluing us in bit by bit to the twisted logic that kept the war going for so long.</span></p> <p><span>One of the greatest ironies of the war unfolded only last week, when Henry Kissinger appeared before the Senate Select Committee on POW and MIA Affairs. Not only is Kissinger back in the news--his grumpy, arrogant mug at the top of The New York Times--but it was a soldier from Vietnam who ordered him there.</span></p> <p><span>John F. Kerry, senator from Massachusetts and head of the subcommittee, was in his final year as a soldier when Kissinger and Richard M. Nixon took the White House on a platform of peace.</span></p> <p><span>As a soldier, Kerry could never have dreamed that he would later call his boss, then thousands of miles away from the Vietnam's jungles and in the comfort of the \"Vite House,\" into a senatorial hearing to explain the greatest, strangest irony of the war: That we had to continue the war in order to end it.</span></p> <p><span>Kerry asked him to explain why American POWs were left behind after the war ended, since their safety was the very reason Kissinger gave for the war's continuance. Kissinger hasn't changed his story one bit, and though that isn't surprising, it is strange.</span></p> <p><span>Kerry's subcommittee has found that Nixon probably abandoned a number of American soldiers in Laos after the \"secret war\" ended. Kissinger defends this abandonment by blaming it on Congress--if Congress had only let the White House fight for a few more months, all Americans could have been safely brought home.</span></p> <p><span>Kerry, on the other hand, thinks the war went on too long as it was, and if Nixon had wanted to bring the soldiers home, he would have done so in 1968, when he promised, and would have taken much better care of their safety at the war's end. Instead, Kissinger left it up to the Vietnamese to force Laos and Cambodia to return American prisoners.</span></p> <p><span>From a man so suspicious of the Vietnamese, this explanation makes little sense. Taken out of the 1968 Red Scare context, little of Kissinger's ranting makes much sense. Last week he seemed to have been dropped whole from another planet, where Watergate never happened and Americans could still believe in Nixon's honesty.</span></p> <p><span>Rather than taking responsibility for the missing soldiers, Kissinger blamed the abandonment of the POWs on \"the Vietnamese,\" who \"are certainly capable of such a cynical act,\" as if an entire race of people could be responsible for Nixon's neglect of the soldiers.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>merica isn't afraid of \"the Vietnamese\" anymore--we now understand that the war may have had as much to do with American politicians as with Viet Cong and North Vietnamese soldiers. Kissinger sounded like a relic, pushing a party line we're all embarrassed to hear.</span></p> <p><span>\"What has happened to this country,\" he asked, \"that a Congressional committee could be asked to inquire whether any American official of whatever administration would fail to move heaven and earth to fight for the release of American POWs and an accounting of the missing?\"</span></p> <p><span>Is Kissinger really asking us to believe that all presidents are inherently honest and virtuous? Is he really dumbfounded that we dare ask a president to account for his actions? Where Kissinger's question--and we've heard it before--could once divide a nation, now it only creates uneasy silence. His arrogant ranting is bizarre and queasily familiar.</span></p> <p><span>Last week's encounter proved that much has changed in America--the Nixon administration went head to head with the \"anarchists,\" and the anarchists won. Those who opposed the war aren't reviled anymore, but they seem to have ended up on the right side of history, behind Senate subcommittee microphones.</span></p> <p><span>So since Vietnam has started to recede into history, it's clear that we had real moral obligations toward both our own soldiers and to the citizens of Vietnam. Yet when we look around us today, we find nothing but Kissinger-style diversionary tactics which are meant to scare the American public into silence and blur our moral obligations. President Bush seems shocked that we want to know about his arms deals with Iraq, his possible complicity in the Iran-contra scandal, his rush for a land war against Saddam Hussein and any number of other issues which question his judgment as president. When he criticizes the media for hyping issues \"the American people\" care nothing about, he is in fact imagining a silent majority, telling us what we want to know about his presidency.</span></p> <p><span>And in his most desperate use of Kissinger like logic, he implies that Gov. Bill Clinton is a draft-dodging hippie America-hater, even though people like John Kerry have dispelled that image forever.</span></p> <p><span>Luckily, it hasn't worked. Americans are tired of refighting the Vietnam War, which Bush promised we had \"kicked\" at the end of the Gulf War. Yet while we may be able to fix our mistakes at home, history may one day ask us why we spend so much time worrying about our own house when we still have no compass to guide our foreign policy. Our children may ask why, for example, we never asked Bush about the genocide of the Kurds in Iraq.</span></p> <p><span>That story isn't much different from that of Vietnam. American promised the Kurds that if they helped fight Saddam Hussein, they would gain independence. Like the soldiers in Vietnam, they upheld their end of the bargain, putting their lives at risk for American victory. And when they became inconvenient once Bush decided that Saddam could stay in power, we simply forgot about them. Where we once had to deal in twisted ironies, now we just ignore our moral problems.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>f there's one thing we learned from Vietnam, it is that we should have done something sooner. The voters should have forced the government to take morally responsible action. Yet throughout the Bush administration and in this election, we have chosen to fall victim to the same fears, of Saddam and radical pinkos, as Kissinger propped up for us in the '60s. We have let ourselves deal in tiny ironies again, in insinuating phrases and images, rather than asking ourselves whether our foreign policy was right or wrong.</span></p> <p><span>After seeing the way history turned back on itself last week, we have to wonder how future generations will judge our decisions this fall. Someday a Gulf War grunt may be sitting in a Senate committee, grilling Brent Scowcroft about his neglect of the Kurdish allies, and his answers will sound as foreign and twisted as those of Henry Kissinger.</span></p> <p><span><i>Michael K.

Clinton, once a soldier in the ideological army of leftist George McGovern, fashions himself a moderate. And President Bush, once an advocate of abortion-rights, now supports a constitutional amendment criminalizing that same procedure.</span></p> <p><span>What would presidential politics be without its born agains, its changes of heart--its flip-flops?</span></p> <p><span>\"Flip-flop:\" the Random House definition reads, \"a sudden or unexpected reversal, as of direction, belief, attitude or policy.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"The opposition,\" it uses by way of example, \"claimed that the president had flip-flopped on certain issues.\"</span></p> <p><span>Looking for current examples? This week was one for the record book of reversals.</span></p> <p><span>In perhaps the greatest flip-flop-flip-agains in political history, Texas billionaire Rose Perot re-entered the race for the presidency. As an undeclared candidate, Perot led in the polls consistently until his \"grassroots\" movements hit the brick wall.</span></p> <p><span>Saying that he cannot resist the call of his volunteers, though, Perot pledged run on. He has stunned the experts with his popularity and pulled the rug out from his volunteers. Now, it seems, he's brushed the rug off and laid it back on the floor.</span></p> <p><span>\"Perot himself is nothing more than a walking bundle of contradictions and flip flops,\" moans Associate Professor of Government Mark A. Peterson, who teaches a course in the American presidency.</span></p> <p><span>Of course, Perot's lamentations of past \"mistakes\"(read: lies) is no rarity.</span></p> <p><span>Bush, for example, denied to the very last that he would summon his old friend and partner in fish James A. Baker III to run the crumbling White House. When the move was actually made, though it was business as usual. No mention of the earlier denials. White House reporters didn't even bother to ask.</span></p> <p><span><b>B</b>ut there is something more precious about a genuine, lips-twitching, mouth-frothing, nosegrowing flip-flop. Real flip-flops have a depth of irony and lunacy that make them unusual. They throw journalists, who never satisfy the urge to communicate the two-faced nature of politics, into a frenzy.</span></p> <p><span>And flip-flops are a cherished tradition. They are an art pioneers by the earliest pioneers of American liberty.</span></p> <p><span>Thomas Jefferson, for example, emphatically opposed wide power for the president, warning of demagoguery. That changed, however, when Jefferson himself was elected to the office.</span></p> <p><span>When the French put a huge piece of real estate called Louisiana on the market in 1803, Jefferson, without seeking Congressional approval, exceeded and thus expanded his executive authority to make the purchase.</span></p> <p><span>Jefferson the idealist won the hearts of journalists forever by declaring that he \"should not hesitate for the moment\" to defend right of newspapers over the right of government.</span></p> <p><span>But Jefferson the politician had a more sour view: \"Nothing can now be believed which is seen in a newspaper,\" he wrote to a friend in 1807. \"Truth itself becomes suspicious by being put in that polluted vehicle.\" (With his attitudes towards the press, Jefferson is surpassed only by Nixon, who spoke eloquently for first amendments freedoms while using the FBI to spy on journalists he thought were dangerous.)</span></p> <p><span>Of course, Jefferson's legacy lies with his famous document of principle--the Declaration of Independence. In a country so devoid of confidence in its leaders, that sort of idealism is guarded carefully.</span></p> <p><span>No wonder that Democrats and Republicans alike this year are invoking the spirit of Franklin Delano Roosevelt '04 to lend credibility to their plans for change. No 20th century figure comes close to Roosevelt's commitment to social and economic justice.</span></p> <p><span>But Clinton and Bush might inquire a little deeper into FDR's past. As a young man at Harvard College, Roosevelt was crushed by his rejection from the Porcellian Club. He thought membership in the elitist organization to be his birthright (after all, cousin Theodore had belonged).</span></p> <p><span>Later in his career, FDR confided to a friend that rejection from the Pork was the greatest disappointment of his life.</span></p> <p><span>Of course, the elder President Roosevelt set a fine tradition for flip-flopping himself. Upon retiring from the presidency in 1908, TR professed to have lost interest in the white House.</span></p> <p><span>But in 1912, Roosevelt changed his mind. He ran for president on the Bull Moose party ticket and became the most successful third party candidate until--you guessed it--Rose Perot.</span></p> <p><span>Those wondering whether Perot has a change to play spoiler in this election needn't look past the 1912 race, in which Roosevelt drew enough votes from William Howard Taft to give Woodrow Wilson victory by plurality.</span></p> <p><span>If presidents are vulnerable to the whims to the electorate, vice-presidents sometimes the smallest of pawns.</span></p> <p><span>Take Lyndon Johnson. In his career as a Senator from Texas, Johnson had a dismal record on issues of civil rights.</span></p> <p><span>But when he became president, Johnson signed into law the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, making him, according to Peterson,\" perhaps the greatest champion of civil rights this country has ever had.\"</span></p> <p><span>The next Democrat and Southerner to assume the presidency, Jimmy Carter, was no stranger to the gumby effect either. He bent in many directions, despite his image today as a man of unparalleled principle.</span></p> <p><span>In 1977, the Democrats in Congress fought tooth and nail for an unpopular $50 tax credit Charter had proposed during the campaign. But when the credit passed the Congress, Carter withdrew his support, infuriating many members of his own party.</span></p> <p><span>The nation's most recent ex-president, Ronald Reagan, has been easier to faults for his honesty than for any lack of consistency. But he also set a record for speed of a flip-flop.</span></p> <p><span>It took Jefferson several decades and Johnson several years to shift on major issues. Reagan only took a couple of minutes.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview on the Iran-Contra scandal, Reagan insisted he never traded arms for hostages. Well, he admitted, it did appear that arms were traded for hostages. Finally he returned to his original denial.</span></p> <p><span>This was in one sitting.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>he dignity of the presidency seemed enough to protect Reagan from critics, but candidates for the office have no such luxury.</span></p> <p><span>The 1988 campaign left two men of the cloth, Jesse L. Jackson and Pat Robertson, particularly red-faced.</span></p> <p><span>Jackson and Robertson both preached against the evils of sex before marriage. But when presented with evidence that their eldest children had been born within weeks of their marriages, both were forced to admit that they had participated in pre-marital sin.</span></p> <p><span>But this year's campaign, perhaps more than any other year in recent memory, has produced an immense batch of flip-flops.</span></p> <p><span>One of the most obvious, and perhaps decisive, is George Bush's now-famous breaking of his \"No new taxes\" pledge. During the 1988 campaign, the then-vice president repeated in nearly every campaign appearance.</span></p> <p><span>In June of 1990, Bush announced that he, regrettably, was unable to fulfill his promise. Behind the scenes, of course, Bush swallowed the tax increase rather than cut popular programs.</span></p> <p><span>While some voters felt betrayed, Peterson said Bush's decision to raise taxes was one of the \"boldest and most courageous moments in his Presidency.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"There is a sense in which he should be applauded rather than ridiculed,\" Peterson said.</span></p> <p><span>But to emphasize the error of his ways, Bush felt compelled to apologize for the tax increase at the 1992 Republican National Convention, telling the party faithful he had made a mistake and would repent with a tax cut if he were re-elected.</span></p> <p><span>Bush is certainly not the only candidates to flip-flop this year, and many of the reversals had far deeper roots than a 1988 pledge. The ever-changing debate on abortion has caused many politicians to change their stances on the divisive issue.</span></p> <p><span>Bush, prior to accepting the Republican vice presidential nomination in 1980, was decidedly prochoice. Now he has made opposition to abortion to a defining element of the Republican platform.</span></p> <p><span>Clinton favored restrictions on abortions early in his tenure as Arkansas governor. Now he has enthusiastically endorsed the Freedom-of-Choice Act, a bill which would make it nearly impossible for the federal government to impose the restrictions he once favored.</span></p> <p><span>Vice presidential candidate AL Gore '69, too, steadfastly opposed federal funding for abortions until ambitions for national office inspired him to change his ways.</span></p> <p><span>Vice president Dan Quayle has been more solid in his opposition to abortion. But he's done his own share of flip-flopping. After a highly publicized attack on television character Murphy Brown's decision to bear a child out of wed lock, Quayle now insists he has no problems with single mothers.</span></p> <p><span>To emphasize his warm, gentle side, Quayle even sent a stuffed, presumably Republican, elephant to the child of the fictional TV anchorwoman as a gift. \"Mr. Vice President, \"observers implored, \"it's TV Get a grip.\"</span></p> <p><span>In general, front-runner Clinton, dubbed slick Willie by his political enemies in Arkansas, is more apt to straddle issues than to do the obvious reversals.</span></p> <p><span>But pressed on the issue of his draft status during the Vietnam War, Clinton has backpeddled his way to the edge of a political cliff.</span></p> <p><span>While he once said that his not being drafted was \"just a fluke,\" Clinton has acknowledged that he used an ROTC program to temporarily avoid the draft and tried to used his political connections to win an exemption from serving.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>he irony of 1992 is the effort to paint Perot as a flake--a man whose on-again/off-again routine makes him unfit for office. But, after months of bad-mouthing Perot, Bush and Clinton rushed to court his supporters the instant he bowed out.</span></p> <p><span>Each side presented itself as the best avenue for carrying out Perot's ideas--the very ideas they had dismissed only days earlier.</span></p> <p><span>Given the precedent, Perot might do well to ignore calls for consistency. Perhaps he should drop out again--then come back in again.</span></p> <p><span>Americans seems to like it when their presidents keep them guessing.</span></p>"}

There are probably a couple of reasons for the unique pattern in Carvey's career.</span></p> <p><span>For one, SNL has had a history of odd characters who become overnight celebrities: Buckwheat, Ed Grimley, Jon Lovitz's compulsive liar, the Samurai Butcher, to name a few.</span></p> <p><span>But Carvey has occupied more of these roles than any previous actor on the show. The answer lies somewhere within Carvey himself. In essence, he looks like a lot of people. Carvey can pass (with the appropriate dress and makeup) for a woman without seeming too freakishly androgynous. He possesses George Bush's dull All-American look with just enough malleable nerdiness to invite ridicule.</span></p> <p><span>Nevertheless, the question remains: Shall we call him George, Church Lady or Garth? Maybe the best thing is to wait for Carvey's next splashy role.</span></p>"}

The whole incident attracted a lot of press.</span></p> <p><span>But we didn't pick the singer because of that.</span></p> <p><span><i>15 Minutes</i> would like to commend Wynette for her performance in the KLF video \"Justified and Ancient\". It seems impossible that anyone could fit in to the British group's bizarre visual style, but Wynette pulls it off pretty well. And her singing part--essentially a narrative describing the genesis of her involvement with the band--provides interesting blend of country and rap. The down home balladeer spins a tale of self-referential urban creation.</span></p> <p><span>Incidentally, rumor has it Wynette demanded an apology from Clinton. Being well acquainted with defending her \"theme song\" against feminist criticism--she's been fielding the punches ever since the single's 1968 release and subsequent crossover success--we imagine she had a lot to say. A excerpt from her 1979 autobiography <i>Stand By Your Man</i> sums up her feelings:</span></p> <p><span>\"I don't see anything in that song that implies a woman is supposed to sit home and raise babies while a man goes out and raises hell...to me it means: be supportive of your man; show him you love him and you're proud of him; and be willing to forgive him if he doesn't always live up to your image of what he should be.</span></p> <p><span>\"Many articles written about me have pointed out that although my theme song is \"Stand By Your Man,\" I've had four husbands. They insinuate I sing one thing and live another. Well, maybe I do, but it hasn't been by choice. I would much rather have stood by one man for a lifetime than four for a short time, but circumstances didn't work out that way.\"</span></p>"}

Is he or isn't he?</span></p> <p><span>So-called \"character issues\" are fast becoming the only topic of political discussion, even as the American people grow more cynical and seem to have less and less idea of what constitutes an ideal personal or national character.</span></p> <p><span>One might conclude that precisely <i>because</i> we no longer know what makes \"e pluribus\" into \"unum,\" we keep trying to inject a shared moral direction into our politics by applying outdated standards to public figures.</span></p> <p><span>There was a time, or so the legend goes, when we had a consensus on the nature of \"American values,\" a prominent part of which was old-fashioned sexual mores. Also important was the idea of military service as an unambiguously moral enterprise, a patriotic duty and a preparation for leadership roles.</span></p> <p><span>For better or worse, nowadays we know that life is more complex. Tensions and flaws in someone's sex life have many causes other than lack of respect for promises or contempt for women. Such tensions and flaws are not so easily made to yield clear evidence of the man's dishonorable intent.</span></p> <p><span>Avoidance of military service is sometimes the most responsible way to respond to a war one believes to be unjust: remember, combat involves not only being brave enough to die for one's country but also being ruthless enough to kill for it.</span></p> <p><span>So why is it that 10 years from now, all we'll remember about Gary Hart, Clarence Thomas and Bill Clinton is their alleged sexual improprieties and draft dodging?</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>T SEEMS that every time a political figure begins to generate discussion about the issues he stands for, a \"character issue\" intervenes and immediately crowds out all the others.</span></p> <p><span>Not that character is a trivial concern. Rather, the question is whether, given the sound-bite nature of modern politics, the American people are capable of assessing that complex and contradictory thing known as a person's character, and whether the criteria they use are valid.</span></p> <p><span>Public figures today are little more than icons. Their personality, distinguishing traits and platform must be easily encapsulated into an image as Uncle Sam or the Democratic donkey.</span></p> <p><span>\"Hi, I'm Joe Smith and I'm for health care and against Japan, and I use #2 Brown Hair Dye.\" Whoops, your 30 seconds are up, Mr. Smith. On to the next candidate.</span></p> <p><span>Despite this handy simplification, the voters still have a problem: they don't know which candidate to vote for, because they're all alike. So another label comes to be affixed to some candidates in order to eliminate them. Did he ever cheat? He must be a Cheater. Someone heard him tell a lie? By gosh, the man's a Liar. Better not vote for <i>him</i>.</span></p> <p><span>Clarence Thomas himself was much in need of simplification. Liberals didn't know whether to support him because his was an African-American success story or denounce him because he had the \"wrong\" position of affirmative action and abortion.</span></p> <p><span>Conservatives who agreed with his prenomination positions were dismayed when he systematically avoided committing himself to any opinions during the hearings. Then the Anita Hill issue intervened and gave everyone a quick litmus test they could use to determine his fitness to serve on the Court.</span></p> <p><span>Unlike Oliver Stone, I'm not going to posit the existence of a conspiracy to derail the American democratic process. Rather, the two phenomena feed each other in a self-perpetuating cycle: people's unwillingness to make complex intellectual discussion part of politics leaves only superficial \"character analyses\" (i.e. rumors) to be debated, which then lowers the standard of the political process further and makes it harder for a public figure's <i>ideas</i> to be his most important characteristic.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b> STEP IN the right direction would be for the media to stop perpetuating these superficial \"character debates.\" You can't open a newspaper lately without seeing an article on the existence or significance of Clinton's alleged extramarital affair or his possible avoidance of the draft for Vietnam.</span></p> <p><span>Another big improvement would be for all of us to give serious thought to how we judge others' characters.</span></p> <p><span>Do we still want to cling to the simplistic old formulas that equated draft avoidance with cowardice, or treated any deviation from sexual propriety as not just a mistake but a crime?</span></p> <p><span>And are we even capable of assessing people's private characters with enough skill to predict their public behavior, when we've never encountered these politicians outside the public domain?</span></p> <p><span>When New Hampshire residents vote in the primaries next Tuesday, these concerns should affect their decisions more than the crude iconography of George Bush the war hero and Bill Clinton the philanderer.</span></p> <p><span>But that's a lot to ask for this time around: the damage has already been done. We can only hope that future political races will depend less on the quick fix and more on the responsible decision-making without which the democratic process is nothing but Pin-the-Tail-on-the-Donkey.</span></p>"}

And 35 million Americans have no health insurance whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span>Bush says his plan would cost $100 billion over the next five years--most of that money going straight into the hands of insurance companies reaping huge windfalls from the additional clients made possible by the voucher plan. Where's the cash coming from, George? \"We'll figure that out,\" says the President.</span></p> <p><span>Who cares about costs? Can we put a price on good health? We better before our economy goes into intensive care. The current rate of health care costs is \"threatening to consume an impossible proportion of the gross domestic product.\" That's not a Bush critic talking. Those are the words of the President's own budget director, Richard Darman.</span></p> <p><span>Bush criticizes Democratic plans as \"socialized medicine.\" Although that phrase does sound vaguely pernicious, the only way to contain costs is for the government either to set spending limits or dictate the terms under which private plans would compete.</span></p> <p><span>This requires either a \"pay-or-play\" scheme, forcing businesses to provide coverage for their workers or to pay into a government fund of the otherwise uninsure, or a Canadian style national health insurance system in which the government pays nearly all health costs. Democratic presidential candidates Bill Clinton and Paul Tongs favor the first approach. Jerry Brown and Bob Kerrey supports the second. (Tom Harkin is still on the fence).</span></p> <p><span>Containing costs requires higher taxes. But don't be fooled--we already pay health \"taxes\"--we just pay them to private insurers instead of the government. If the government were actively employed to hold down costs, we'd send a bigger slice of our paychecks to Washington, but we'd get back more in return by writing smaller checks--or no checks at all--to insurers.</span></p> <p><span>The President claims that his plan \"insures choice\"--an uncontroversial goal. But the Bush plan actually works to <i>limit</i> choice by encouraging the use of \"managed care\" and health maintenance organizations (HMOs) which hold down costs by restricting their client's choice of doctor and hospital--and often limit doctors' options as well.</span></p> <p><span>What's the best way to guarantee choice? The President's nemesis, \"socialized medicine.\" In Canada, anyone can walk into any doctor's office or any hospital. Not so here.</span></p> <p><span>Bush's plan is extremely odd. As Jerry Brown would say, there's certain unreality here. Bush goes to great lengths to expand the options for uninsured Americans but does little to help keep down costs. He aims to reduce the \"paperwork blizzard\" of health care administration but adds another layer of bureaucracy through the voucher system. He triumphs choice of doctor but advocates HMOs.</span></p> <p><span><b>P</b>ERHAPS BUSH'S PLAN is just a ruse. As Yogi Berra might say, the President may be dumb, but he isn't stupid. He <i>knows</i> his plan is too silly to pass. He <i>knows</i> that most Democrats favor more radical reform. But now his name is no the health care scoreboard, blunting a potent Democratic weapon. His gambit is that voters will be too confused by the intricacies of health care reform to be able to distinguish between rivaling plans. He may be right.</span></p> <p><span>Or perhaps Bush has another motive. Why would he propose such an outrageously expensive plan, basically a massive tax cut that will transfer government money into the coffers of insurance firms? (Don't be fooled--outlawing \"cream-skimming\" will only jack up rates for the rest of us).</span></p> <p><span>This is an old technique refined by Ronald Reagan and his budget director David Stockman: Spend enough money elsewhere, and you'll be able to resist calls for spending on programs you don't like. \"We simply don't have the money. We spent it all on guns.\"</span></p> <p><span>Bush learned this lesson well. Spend enough money on health care reform-even though other plans would spend <i>less</i> yet ensure <i>better</i> care for <i>more</i> people--and you'll able to turn down proposals for full funding of Head Start, for earned-income tax credits for the working poor, for expanded prenatal care. \"We simply don't have the money. We gave it all to the insurance companies.\"</span></p> <p><span>Uh-oh, there goes the peace dividend. Oh, well. So much for domestic policy.</span></p> <p><span>[Message: let's do lunch with Yeltsin.]</span></p>"}
{"title": "Cryptic Love Candies | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b> CAN'T THINK OF A Valentine's candy without fault. Russell Stover's Marshmallow Hearts are to sticky. Their Peanut Butter Hearts are too messy, and there's something very unromantic about peanut butter anyway. Those tiny cinnamon hearts are just too hot and spicy--too sexy for my mouth.</span></p> <p><span>These are not serious flaws. There is, however, a Valentine's candy which perplexes me more than any other. It is a candy which raises extremely important issues about relationships. It is a candy which has been given to me on this day, year after year, by well-meaning school teachers, relatives, friends and sometimes, <i>boys.</i> But despite people's good intentions, I am always left confused and hurt by Conversation Hearts.</span></p> <p><span>They taste like chalk, but they're mysteriously addictive. When I bought Conversation Hearts at the end of January, my friends exclaimed \"Ooh! I love those!\" and grabbed handfuls. No one else seemed to be bothered by the candies, or provoked into writing an editorial. But then again, I over-analyze, I need specifics, and I read between the lines.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b> REALLY TRIED TO make sense of them this year. Surely the little sayings were printed there for a reason. Surely it all meant <i>something.</i> How could a candy company be so wicked as to knowingly fool around with the sugar-consuming public's emotions? I decided to pay very close attention to the slogans. I was going to figure it all out.</span></p> <p><span>With the help of blockmates and friends, I recorded the saying of hundreds of conversation hearts. \"Yes, you can have a conversation heart,\" I'd say to them as they eyed the bag with longing, \"but first you have to tell me what it says. I'm keeping track.\" The project made the evening of January 28 into an absurd event: as George Bush gave his State of the Union address, a dozen of us sat in my room, eating hearts I took note of the sayings. Amidst bursts of congressional applause, my blockmates would turn to me and murmur in low, sultry voices, LET'S ROCK. SAY YES. DIG ME.</span></p> <p><span>Eventually every bag was empty, and I thought I'd throw up if I had to chew one more grape-flavored LOVER BOY. Now came the challenge. To help myself make sense of all this romantic wisdom, I tried to categorize the sayings. Then, I thought, I would understand not only the candy, but love itself.</span></p> <p><span><b>Good, Wholesome Traditional Family Values (Yawn)</b>. This was a collection of sayings reminiscent of Hallmark cards, 1950's Attractive Family TV sitcoms, mom, apple pie...and State of the Union addresses: LUV YA. NICE GRIL. BE MINE. BE GOOD. BE TRUE. I DO.</span></p> <p><span><b>Oh Look, A Public Display of Affection/I'm Going to Puke.</b> HONEY. HONEY BUN. LOVE BUG. LOVER BOY. DREAM GIRL. MY MAN.</span></p> <p><span><b>Groovy Kind of Love.</b> Most likely, these sayings were introduced in the 1960's, when the word \"love\" was preceded by \"free,\" and things were more...well, groovy: CRAZY. COLL. FOR OUT. HOT MAMA. STAY LOOSE. DIG ME.</span></p> <p><span><b>No Means No.</b>NOT ME. NO WAY. NOT NOW. STOP. BUZZ OFF.</span></p> <p><span>Finally, there was <b>Blatant Sex</b> category: HOT STUFF. FOXY. LET'S GO WILL YOU.. TRY ME. OH. BOY. And if I employed a little of my imagination, I could I detect within Blatant extra <b>Justify My Love</b> category: HUG ME. COAX ME. KISS ME <i>(that's right, kiss me)</i> LOVE ME <i>(that's right, love me...i wanna be your baby...)</i></span></p> <p><span>Of course, there were random sayings that I had trouble fitting any where, sayings like SOLID, SMILE and even LOVE. There were other problems with my system. What was I to do when the heart's saying was poorly stamped? Did I assume it was mistake, or consider it an entirely new message? For example, I had a few instances of LOVE BUG that looked more like LOVE BUS, and one especially ambiguous New Age-y heart which simply said. BE Other hearts were eerily blank.</span></p> <p><span><b>MY</b> PROJECTS WAS completed. But so what? What did I have to show for my research, besides threateningly high plaque levels? Even worse, I was afraid I might have seriously misinterpreted the candy. I called Walter J. Marshall, marketing and special projects manage of the New England Con fectionery Company in Cambridge, where conversation hearts originated.</span></p> <p><span>Marshall told me that at the Cambridge plant, there are about fifty sayings printed on the hearts. Sayings are changed from time to time, he said, but not for any particular reason. And when I asked Marshall whether the sayings were meant to be ambiguous, he chucked a little and told me, \"You're trying to put too much into the slogans...People think we stay up all night thinking of the sayings, but we don't.\"</span></p> <p><span>Marshall must be kind of person who doesn't stay up all night waiting for the phone to ring, either. He probably doesn't stress about relationships, and he probably doesn't even read conversation hearts before popping ten of them into his mouth.</span></p> <p><span>Well, maybe <i>I</i> do some of these things. Maybe I think the sayings are too significant to dismiss as \"novelty.\" I mean, this is <i>intimacy</i> we're dealing with.</span></p> <p><span>I think Marshall recognizes that the words do contain some kind of power. He reeled off some of the sayings for me--\"KISS ME...LOVE ME...\" paused, and then said something under his breath about how this phone call could get him arrested. The language of love is indeed risky, and on candy it can be downright dangerous. Maybe it's time to update the slogans. Marshall tells me that the candies were invented sometime around World War I. If any of the sayings in the current series are left over from that era--well, that was a while ago. It might be time to add more contemporary sayings that I at least recognize: THE \"C\" WORD. WE NEED TO TALK. LET'S JUST BE FRIENDS. DO ME. SAFE SEX.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b> GUESS I probably to attach to much meaning to a piece of sugar. I must be emotionally scarred from an incident in junior high, when the future high school quarter back raced down the hall, pursued by his rowdy friends. As he passed me at my locker, he thrust a conversation heart down the back of my shirt. He kept running. I forget what the heart said, but I was intrigued. Over the next few days, I waited for some kind of follow-up, some explanation, some profession of love. Nothing happened.</span></p> <p><span>Basically, my relationship with conversation hearts has brought me nothing but grief. And so I'm breaking it off. It's over. There are other fish in the sea; other candies at CVS. I don't care if the hearts are sodium and fat free. I don't care if the rest of the world enjoys the candy for pure taste. I've tried to make this thing work, and it hasn't. I am afraid of them, I'm sick of them, and from this day forward, I vow to abstain from all romantic exchange stamped on sugar. DIG ME?</span></p>"}

Bob Kerrey focused on what he sees as the campaign's defining issue--national health care.</span></p> <p><span>\"I've run the risk of being a single issue candidate and I make no apologies for that,\" Kerrey said during a campaign stop.</span></p> <p><span>His call for national health care is almost always followed by an emotional talk about his service in Vietnam--where he lost a leg and won a Congressional Medal of Honor.</span></p> <p><span>Kerrey says he hopes to build a country where \"the doctor says `where does it hurt' and not, 'how you're going to pay.'\"</span></p> <p><span>Sen.

Edmund G. Brown, who prefers white turtlenecks to dress shirts and grassroots politics to Washington.</span></p> <p><span>Cultivating an image as an \"outsider\" instead of a \"run-of-the-mill\" politician, Brown invariably refers to the corrupt political system and mentions his toll free 800 number.</span></p>"}

Bill Clinton, in the tradition of former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart, was the target this year, with allegations of marital infidelity and draft dodging surfacing in the press.</span></p> <p><span>But this year was different. The story was covered so extensively that Clinton's main opponent became the press.</span></p> <p><span>When the Arkansas governor rebounded from polls, showing him losing support to gain a strong second place finish, Clinton celebrated victory--over the media.</span></p> <p><span>\"At least, I've proved one thing,\" Clinton said in Merrimack Tuesday night. \"I can take a punch.\"</span></p> <p><span>Although the campaign did not always entertain the press corps, some reporters said they were said to see New Hampshire go.</span></p> <p><span>\"I'm gonna miss this,\" one Manchester Union-Leader reporter mumbled to a colleague as they watched the election returns roll in Tuesday night.</span></p> <p><span>\"Before the election, we could get better access than some of the national press.

{"title": "Not the Right Stuff, Baby | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><i>Editor's note: This is the second of a two-part series on the Republican party.</i></span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE DOOMSAYERS are at it again. Many political watchers--both liberal and conservative--have marked Patrick J. Buchanan's candidacy as the beginning of the end for the Bush presidency.</span></p> <p><span>Part retribution for Bush's deviations from Reaganism and part fulfillment of long-held fears about his moderate Republicanism, a revolt on the Right does indeed seem to be brewing. Many conservatives find commentator-turned-candidate Buchanan an eager and capable tool to use in drawing Bush back to the Right--and perhaps evicting him from office.</span></p> <p><span>Others, however, dismiss Buchanan as a crank who stands no chance on a national level and who seems to be a \"David Duke without the peroxide.\" What is the truth? Is this man a threat to the head of his own party, or merely an irresponsible columnist who has grown too big for his britches? Probably the latter. Here's why.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>O HIS CREDIT, Buchanan, by most accounts, is considered to be a serious challenger. His nationally broadcast shows on CNN and his widely syndicated newspaper column have given him a loyal audience, with particularly strong backing among the Republican Right.</span></p> <p><span>In addition, Buchanan qualified for federal matching funds faster than any candidate since the funding system was implemented in the '70s. In fact, he has already outraised Governor Moonbeam (Jerry Brown), though he still has a long way to go to catch Bush ($700,000 versus $10 million).</span></p> <p><span>And most recently, all of the president's weaknesses have seemed to play to Buchanan's advantage since he is the only conservative challenger in the race (a certain neo-Nazi notwithstanding).</span></p> <p><span>In pivotal New Hampshire, Buchanan enjoys surprisingly strong support. This is partly due to New Hampshire voters' disaffection with Bush, partly due to the appeal of the poison of protectionism which Buchanan preaches and partly due to the support of The Manchester Union-Leader, New Hampshire's foremost newspaper. In short, when one looks below the surface, Buchanan seems to pose a credible threat to Bush.</span></p> <p><span>A closer analysis, however, reveals that Buchanan is not the one to capture conservative voters. To begin with, his complete lack of elective experience and his questionable statements on race and immigration make for a weak candidacy. Even more importantly for his election hopes, however, are his differences with most conservatives on the issues of free trade, America's role abroad and Israel.</span></p> <p><span>While Buchanan's lack of experience in elective office may very well make him a better person than most politicians, that does not qualify him to sit in the Oval Office. Any student of government knows the value of political alliances, a seasoned staff and prior experience in dealing with everything from foreign leaders to Congress to the federal bureaucracy.</span></p> <p><span>Buchanan served as a speechwriter in the Nixon White House, as an aide in the Ford transition and as Reagan's director of communications. Wow. Several Harvard professors, including Professors Roger B. Porter, Martin S. Feldstein '61 and Robert D. Putnam have served in much higher posts, and I wouldn't want to see any of them as president, either. (Well, maybe Marty.)</span></p> <p><span>Still, many conservatives are happy to hear at least part of what Buchanan is saying. Yet unless he puts his proposals into practice (or, of course, causes Bush to adopt them), his impact as a candidate is not much greater than his impact as a columnist/commentator has been.</span></p> <p><span>To put these proposals into practice, he needs to be able to work within the structure of government. Those who would disagree have the specter of Jimmy Carter (shudder) as a man who campaigned against Washington and tried to govern without it as well. A Buchanan presidency would be similar in terms of its ultimate effectiveness (i.e., nil).</span></p> <p><span>As for his questionable statements, they don't <i>necessarily</i> impugn his character--but they do call his judgment into question. A litany of offensive remarks have been credited to Buchanan by friends and critics alike in recent months. Even William F. Buckley, a hero of Buchanan, found it \"impossible to defend [Buchanan] from the charge of anti-Semitism.\"</span></p> <p><span>Yet while the cranky columnist complains about the Israeli \"amen corner,\" he had been, until the onset of the <i>Intifada,</i> an advocate of a pro-Israel policy. The <i>Intifada,</i> he argues, convinced him that there were strong arguments against Israeli claims.</span></p> <p><span>What I suggest is that seeming contradictions in Buchanan's record exist. At the very least, Buchanan's oft-quoted statements reveal poor judgment. That alone is a significant strike against him.</span></p> <p><span>To go further and argue that Buchanan is unquestionably an anti-Semite and a racist is problematic, however. As Michael E. Kinsley '72 pointed out about Buchanan recently, such labels carry such great moral weight that they should not be cheapened by arbitrary use--especially when clear proof of the label is lacking.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE BUCHANAN CANDIDACY, in many ways, is the last gasp of a once-proud movement. Buchanan, by most definitions, represents what political observers call paleoconservatism, a movement otherwise in remission for four decades. Protectionism and isolationism were the hallmarks of this Old Right--tenets that are rejected by most Americans today. This is the movement for which Pat Buchanan is today's standard bearer.</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately for Buchanan, paleocon-servatism was dispatched by the rank-and-file of the Republican party 40 years ago. In 1952, Sen. Robert A. Taft, \"Mr. Republican,\" met defeat at the hands of Dwight D. Eisenhower. Ike, of course, had spent the primary season in Europe as Supreme Allied Commander.</span></p> <p><span>Discomfort with Taft's paleoconservatism, seen as discredited by the failure of high tariffs, the global implications of World War II and the formation of the Soviet Bloc, was strong enough to carry Ike to the nomination and eventual victory. While it is not true that this was the final defeat of paleoconservatives, Taft's failed candidacy was the closest such activists ever came to capturing the big prize in the postwar era.</span></p> <p><span>While a superficial analysis could equate the Eisenhower \"Eastern Establishment\" coalition of 1952 to the Bush supporters of 1988/92, there is more to the story. Part of the Eisenhower coalition included a group that grew dissatisfied during the early 1960s, then openly revolted against anti-Vietnam sentiment and the Great Society.</span></p> <p><span>Though this is an oversimplification, it was this movement of which Ronald Reagan became the champion and which carried Reagan to near-victory in 1976 and solid wins throughout the '80s. Bush retained enough of this constituency to win in '88 because he ran on the Right.</span></p> <p><span>Now, however, it is this group that is disenchanted with the tax-raising, bigspending and rudderless administration it elected. Buchanan, of course, must capture this disgruntled group, these neoconservatives, if he hopes to score electoral victories against Bush. But he cannot for the simple fact that he is not one of them. Remember, Buchanan is a Old Right adherent.</span></p> <p><span>Bush's apostasy separates him from this group as well. Still, Bush's incumbency, combined with the lack of a realistic alternative, will attract this support in the final analysis. Thus, while a hole for a conservative does exist, only a neoconservative, such as Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp or former Education Secretary and Drug Czar William Bennett, could capitalize on the opportunity Bush's backsliding has created.</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>HILE BUCHANAN cannot be expected to succeed electorally, this seeming failure must be qualified, for if success is measured by the triumph of ideas, rather than individuals, Buchanan will indeed win his battle with Bush. (Likewise, the real winner of the '92 election, at least as far as economic policy, will be Ronald Reagan.)</span></p> <p><span>In 1972, conservative Republican Rep. John Ashbrook challenged Richard M. Nixon in the primaries. Ashbrook captured a measly 9.7 percent in New Hampshire, after which he dropped out of the race. But Ashbrook did not leave the race because of his poor showing--he left because Nixon agreed, explicitly or implicitly, to adopt the fundamental complaints Ashbrook had against the administration.</span></p> <p><span>Buchanan will easily surpass Ashbrook's showing (the most recent Boston Globe polls give him approximately 29 percent). While no one should or could expect Bush to adopt a protectionist trade policy, Bush will be forced to the Right to recapture some of his lost support.</span></p> <p><span>In the end, Buchanan will lose. By Super Tuesday at the latest, his candidacy will crash and burn. He will, however, succeed in pressuring the president back to the position from which he began and won the 1988 campaign--squarely on the (neocon-servative) Right.</span></p>"}

She added, however, that since her husband was the one running for office, the focus should be on his ideas.</span></p> <p><span>\"Paul is the candidate and he ultimately decides the issues,\" she said. \"I willingly say my opinion, but I don't volunteer it.\"</span></p> <p><span>Support for Nicki Tsongas was widespread at the Exeter forum.</span></p> <p><span>\"She's very impressive,\" said Dehdan A. Miller '93-'94. \"He always quips that she should run and that [the voters] should vote for her because of the public presence she has.\"</span></p> <p><span>The same support has been given to Clinton's wife Hillary, who was introduced as the next First Lady of the United States at the Clinton celebration after debate party on Sunday. When asked by The Crimson what he thought of being called \"Hillary's husband,\" the Democratic presidential candidate answered, \"I love it.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"There's no one in the world more qualified to be first lady than my wife, and I'm honored that she is my wife,\" Clinton said.</span></p> <p><span>And indeed Hillary Clinton appears to be a strong asset to the Arkansas Governor, who has been plagued by questions of his marital fidelity.</span></p> <p><span>\"One of the factors in making my decision [to support Clinton] is I believe that Hillary will make an excellent First Lady,\" said Michael J. Lombardo, from Cherry Hill, N.J. \"She is an excellent model for today's youth.\"</span></p> <p><span>If candidates are playing up their wives some supporters of the unmarried candidates are worried that their candidates may be hurt. But Beth A. Pherriault a staunch supporter of Nebraska Senator Bob Kerrey said the fact that her candidate was not married had no bearing on her choice.</span></p> <p><span>\"Frankly, we could save a lot of money if they didn't have a wife,\" Pherriault said. \"I mean look at Nancy.\"</span></p>"}

{"title": "Democrats Play Nice in Final Debate | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>GOFFSTOWN, N.H.--Everyone played fair and nobody got hurt Sunday night at St. Anselm's college, where the five major Democratic candidates squared off in their last debate before today's primary election. The candidates agreed on most issues, and all voiced their unity in planning to defeat George Bush in November.</span></p> <p><span>There was no clear winner and no clear loser in Sunday's debate, leaving today's balloting as unpredictable as ever.</span></p> <p><span>The debate was largely uneventful, with the exception of a minor energy policy scuffle that occupied almost half of the 45-minute open discussion time of the debate. During that argument, former Massachusetts Sen. Paul E. Tsongas, who is leading in New Hampshire polls, was besieged by his fellow Democrats for his refusal to support the scrapping of all nuclear power plants.</span></p> <p><span>\"Having been through debates when I was patronized,\" Tsongas said at a press conference after the debate, \"I enjoyed being in the battle for a change.\"</span></p> <p><span>As the front-runner, Tsongas had the most to lose in the debate. He chose to open by lashing out at Bush, a tactic he maintained throughout the evening. The candidate, who has billed himself as pro-business though others have called him economically conservative, also took a firmer stand on trade policy.</span></p> <p><span>While in the past he has criticized American \"Japan-bashing\" and has called for improving the quality of American goods, this time he hinted that there is more to the problem and introduced the idea of boycotting Japanese products.</span></p> <p><span>\"The Japanese have not been fair. They are restrictive, \" Tsongas said. \"If the Japanese are not willing to be reasonable, then you have to play hardball.\"</span></p> <p><span>While Tsongas has made an increased effort in recent weeks to use humor on the campaign trail, he toned down his routine somewhat Sunday night. He also wore thick, black-rimmed glasses to de-emphasize the swelling caused by a wood chip lodged in his eye last week.</span></p> <p><span>Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, who trails Tsongas in the polls, was characteristically smooth throughout the debate.</span></p> <p><span>Both Clinton and his fellow Democrats steered clear of the two major controversies of Clinton's campaign, the alleged extramarital affair first reported by a supermarket tabloid last month and the more recent charge that, as a student, he may have tried to avoid being drafted to serve in Vietnam.</span></p> <p><span><b>'A Clean Break'</b></span></p> <p><span>Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin spoke the most loudly against Bush, befitting the image he has created for himself as \"The only real Democrat\" in the campaign. Early in the debate, Harkin cited his \"proven record of beating Republicans,\" and called for \"a clean break with Reagan-Bush trickle-down economics.\"</span></p> <p><span>Harkin got off to a questionable start, responding to the first three questions he was asked with speeches on other topics. Asked about defense spending cuts, for example, Harkin took the opportunity to \"thank the people of New Hampshire\" for their generosity and support. Later in the debate, however, Harkin outlined specific proposals of his five-point economic plan.</span></p> <p><span>Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerry made what was probably the strongest showing relative to previous position in the polls, turning on his charm for the event.</span></p> <p><span>Kerrey framed his Bush-bashing in terms of foreign aid, saying that the president had \"his head outside the Cold War but his body still in it.\"</span></p> <p><span>He said the president should be addressing the issue of national health care, a topic which the candidate emphasizes so heavily that many accuse him of being a single issue candidate. Kerrey tried to defuse this charge by calling health insurance \"not the end [of his platform] but the beginning.\"</span></p> <p><span>It was Brown who came out with the most novel strategy, pitting himself against front-runner Tsongas in a two-person race despite his lackluster place in the polls. He said Tsongas represented conservative, business-oriented concerns, while he maintained \"a reform view.\"</span></p> <p><span>While sharply critical of Bush, Brown was also more willing to put down his competitors, accusing Tsongas of supporting nuclear power, for instance.</span></p> <p><span>In his closing statement, Brown prompted applause and laughter from the media hall next door when he gave out his toll-free contribution number for the third straight debate.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Locals Bash, Praise Candidate Debate | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>MANCHESTER, N.H.--Town locals, campaign volunteers and undecided voters discussed, bashed and praised the debate performances of the five democratic presidential candidates, as they engaged in good old-fashioned porch swing politics and bar-stool commentary at restaurants and support rallies across the Granite State.</span></p> <p><span>Television stations were tuned into the debate in many downtown Manchester restaurants Sunday night, as watchers cheered their candidates on. At the Salty Dog Restaurant, located blocks away from several of the candidates' headquarters, campaign workers and amateur political commentators gathered to discuss the future of the 1992 democratic ticket.</span></p> <p><span>\"No one is stellar,\" said Monica M. Paddick, an undecided voter from Philadelphia. \"They are technocratic candidates who don't seem to address the issues that the people care about.\"</span></p> <p><span>Paddick, who is leaning toward supporting the Mario Cuomo draft movement, came to New Hampshire to decide which candidate to endorse. But unlike Paddick, most watchers had already declared their loyalty to one of the campaigns and were ready to comment on the candidates and predict the outcome of today's primary.</span></p> <p><span>\"[Bill] Clinton and [Tom] Harkin were insanely bad,\" said John Domesic, a reporter from the Challis Messenger in Idaho. \"Harkin is completely superficial and [Jerry] Brown's ideas are better than all of them.\"</span></p> <p><span>Although most observers have a favored candidate, they also said they believe the race will be close and that a singular good or bad performance on television will not \"make or break\" any of the presidential potentials' election efforts.</span></p> <p><span>Michael J. Lombardo, a realtor and private investigator from Cherry Hill, NJ, said he believed [Bob] Kerrey might have made some gains from the debate because of his aggressiveness. He added that [Paul] Tsongas was the \"loser\" because he had the curse of Bush's campaign last election, being a whimp, and that Tsongas would make a good secretary of commerce. Lombardo was at the Kerrey rally in Concord yesterday, parading with a sign in support of Clinton.</span></p> <p><span>At the Clinton debate watch party at the High 5 Restaurant, supporters said they were thrilled with his performance and that Clinton should have enough of a stronghold on the voters to win a spot on the '92 ticket even if he loses to regional favorite, Tsongas.</span></p> <p><span>\"Clinton gave the best performance--he showed both communicative skills and a grasp of the issues,\" said U.S. Representative Dave McCurdy (D-Oklahoma), chair of the House Intelligence Committee. \"What is important to the public is who best can compete against Bush...The most articulate is Clinton. He has no hesitation, no shuttering.\"</span></p> <p><span>Joyce M. Zwirnbaum, a student from George Mason University and a Clinton volunteer, said that Clinton's \"electability\" and his appeal to a wide range of age groups are major factors to his success during both the debate and overall campaign.</span></p> <p><span>And Clinton supporters, as well as other candidates' constituencies, agree that bad press, negative campaigning and a misconstrued comment will not chip any presidential would-be's image in the Granite State.</span></p> <p><span>\"Clinton has already come off two major hits...and he is still in the front-running,\" said Rebecca A. Mattila, a volunteer at Clinton's Washington office. She said Clinton's ability to maintain credibility in the race after the Jennifer Flowers and draft controversies proves that voters this year are more concerned about hard core issues.</span></p> <p><span>Tsongas followers also felt their candidate will feel no repercussions from his alleged \"Japan bashing\" during the debate.</span></p> <p><span>After a speech at Phillips Exeter Academy yesterday, Tsongas told The Crimson that he believed in taking a strong stance in trade negotiations with Japan and that he did not imply that the United States should take any legislative actions in the form of boycotts or sanctions. He added that he was \"no Japan basher.\"</span></p> <p><span>Despite the differences in what observers believe and predict, however, most debate watchers agreed that no matter which candidate appears on the ticket in 1992, any Democrat will be a better alternative to the Bush-Quayle team.</span></p> <p><span>\"There is a good field of people running this year,\" said Lombardo. \"What will determine who will be in the [presidential] election will be voter turnout...But it won't matter who will be the standard bearer in the election because anybody is better than Bush.\"</span></p>"}

What were you expecting?</span></p> <p><span><b>CB:</b> Pretty much what we get. Usually we get a cross section of everything; I'm kind of proud that we get a pretty diverse following. I really think we really have something for everyone. All different types of music. We don't have really one style. We try to be diverse and cover a broad range of dimensions.</span></p> <p><span><b>15 MINUTES:</b> Is Harvard different from other colleges?</span></p> <p><span><b>CB:</b> You can sort of measure it by sort of different facets of the crowd--rowdiness, drunkeness, receptiveness to certain phenomena. Just to give you an example, this audience was really receptive to the rap. When I spoke to them, they were really receptive to the words. Some places you go to, they just want a groove. These kids were really listening. They're used to being talked to.</span></p> <p><span><b>15 MINUTES:</b> Why do you attract such a large following of deadhead kids?</span></p> <p><span><b>CB:</b> These days kids dress like deadheads wherever you go. Walk into an A&amp;P, walk into a 7 eleven--wherever you go, kids dress like deadheads. What do you know?...They're by no means a focus for this band. Our bass player hates The Dead. For me I'm more into things I read and stuff I listen to.</span></p> <p><span><b>15 MINUTES:</b> What's with the languages you speak?</span></p> <p><span><b>CB:</b> MOW B'Jow. It is an attempt at a translation of the sentiment of angels.</span></p> <p><span><b>15 MINUTES:</b> Is it in any particular tongue?</span></p> <p><span><b>CB:</b> In MOW B'Jow. Somewhere between a language of thought and speech, thought translated into speech.</span></p> <p><span><b>15 MINUTES:</b> What's the mystical angle of the music?</span></p> <p><span><b>CB:</b> This world is full of misplaced mysticism. If you have a problem with your car, that is the mystical car--where really the properties and possibilities of the car are the mystical thing. what's the question? A music concert is a place...it's an open format its like a play with the script being made up at the same time. There is also theatre. Theatre is from when people though a bear was going to come and eat them there are certain parts of the tribe that ventured forth from the cave to slay the bear. When they succeeded in doing this, they returned to the cave and told the rest of the people--that stayed at home and couldn't watch--how they did it. At that period of time and still on a subconscious level, all things were endowed with spirit, with a mystical essence. They'll never explain everything there'll always be a fring of human thought wavering in a breeze of unsurity. And that's where we are. It's imagination we're trying to entice people like pied pipers to the edge of their souls.</span></p> <p><span><b>15 MINUTES:</b> What about Blues Traveller?</span></p> <p><span><b>CB:</b> I love those guys. I've known them since I was a teenager.</span></p> <p><span><b>15 MINUTES:</b> Why are you so popular?</span></p> <p><span><b>CB:</b> Why are we so popular? I think it's because we have a sincere love of the search and service we perform. If we're anything we're sincere. And although everyone's a hypocrite, we're trying to burn our fingers on sparks and I'm sure that must be entertaining to most. Just to search don't be afraid of life that's usually so mundane. We're saying don't be afraid.</span></p> <p><span><b>15 MINUTES:</b> Where's your next step?</span></p> <p><span><b>CB:</b> We've been out of the country. Ithink it's three times. for the first time, now,we're going to go counterclockwise.</span></p> <p><span><b>15 MINUTES:</b> How was your reception inSan Francisco?</span></p> <p><span><b>CB:</b> We're doing well in San Francisco.Its not just the deadheads that come to see us.Its the intellectuals, weirdos, gay people. We'rerealy interested in human question, and so are TheDead. God bless them. I happen to think they'reone of the greatest rock bands that ever came downthe pike. But God knows there is more to the worldthan rock and roll bands, as you well know.there's physics and orgasms and pineapples.</span></p> <p><span><b>15 MINUTES:</b> Who're you going to vote forfor president?</span></p> <p><span><b>CB:</b> I wish Frank Zappa would bepresident. I'm a devout American. I think theprinciples, the original concept of the americandemocracy, is a beautiful concept for agovernment. I'm not sure if the execution lives upto it. I'm afraid if I vote for Zappa, I would besupporting Bush. So my answer is anybody but Bush.</span></p> <p><span><b>15 MINUTES:</b> How many years is Tysongoing to get?</span></p> <p><span><b>CB:</b> If he is really guilty, they shouldput his ass away. It's a shame that the other mostpopular rapists lately got acquitted and the Blackguy gets thrown in jail. I mean if he did, I hopethey fry his genitalia. If he didn't, I hope he'snot taking the fall just because he's Black.</span></p> <p><span><b>15 MINUTES:</b> Is your music alternative?</span></p> <p><span><b>CB:</b> It's rock and roll in the broadestsense. If rock and roll is a range of fieldsstretching from reggae to heavy metal, andeverything in between stemming from Africanrhythms and tonalties, then we are a rock and rollband in the broadest sense of the term. The onelabel I can't put on all our tunes is rock androll. My favorite rock and roll band is theRolling Stones. I like Jonathan Richmond and theModern Lovers. I really think people should readmore poetry.</span></p> <p><span><b>15 MINUTES:</b> Who are your favorite poets?</span></p> <p><span><b>CB:</b> I really like Homer a lot. I likethe classics. I think there's a need forreconstruction in poetry. I've read the Odysseythree times, three different translations.

That's my favorite chore, toread arcane, abstract tomes.</span></p> <p><span><b>15 MINUTES:</b> How long have you beenplaying together?</span></p> <p><span><b>CB:</b> Three years.</span></p> <p><span><b>15 MINUTES:</b> Do you like to play fuckedup?</span></p> <p><span><b>CB:</b> I don't like to. I don't haveanything against people getting fucked up. I don'thave anything against people sucking goat dicks,but I find that when I smoke I sing off pitch. Oneof the reasons that we're a pretty popular band isthat we have a sense of honoring our ticket weconsider our ticket a contract I have signed andhanded to everyone in the crowd and said I amgoing to do the best. I've tripped on acid onstage a number of times so you never going to nowwhen that happens.</span></p> <p><span><b>15 MINUTES:</b> What's that like?</span></p> <p><span><b>CB:</b> Extremely frightening. It's baptismby fire. But it's very rewarding. Pot tires myvoice off. I used to get really high when my voicewas high. now I'm willing to slow down. It's notso cool now to be carrying pot around the country.</span></p> <p><span><b>15 MINUTES:</b> Where'd you go to school?</span></p> <p><span><b>CB:</b> I went to Princeton High. I went toBennington for one year. I studied ceramics, alittle anthropology. I got into poetry, though. Igot into writing my own poetry. I wrote poetry fora while before I got into others. I'm dyslexic soits hard for me to read. So I had to work prettyhard towards being a poet before I got around toreading other people's poetry. I don't think I'm apoet yet by any means. I have a way to go.</span></p> <p><span><b>15 MINUTES:</b> What's your personal goal?</span></p> <p><span><b>CB:</b> My personal goal is to live on afarm and rule a dog and a cow and a pig.</span></p> <p><span><b>15 MINUTES:</b> Who do you like out thereright now?</span></p> <p><span><b>CB:</b> Perry Farrell (former lead singerfor Jane's Addiction) I think is the greatestthing since sliced bread. I weep that he quit.He's so beautiful the things he does and says. Iwent to see them once. It was so funny there werelike 10,000 people there. And I felt like I wasthe only person in the crowd who understood whathe was saying. I wouldn't presume to know him, butI would presume to know what its like to be up onstage behind a mike stand. He made this comment,\"you guys, you're like worms out there, tenthousand worms out here\" and I shouted out at thetop of my lung, \"what do the fuck do you meanPerry? What the fuck are you talking about?\"That's weird, though, `cause I knew exactly whathe was talking about. Anyway, that's sort of anobscure story.</span></p> <p><span><b>15 MINUTES:</b> Why didn't you guys play\"Two Princes\" (the band's most recent single)tonight?</span></p> <p><span><b>CB:</b> One of the things about this band iswe try not to play the same set twice. We try tomix it up. When we first started playing. Weplayed in New York City, where you have to playlike five nights a week. Just to keep ourselvesinterested and to keep people coming back, we playa different set everynight. Just like tonight, wedidn't play two princes. So you come back anothernight and maybe we'll play it</span></p>"}

On this Saturday, the tabloid in the window runs the cover story \"Bill Clinton's Four-in-a-Bed Orgies with Black Hookers\" and \"'He's The Father of My Child,' Claims Ghetto Gal He Had Sex With Thirteen Times.\" It is primary season in New Hampshire with three days to go.</span></p> <p><span>The sky is a white void, no clouds, just an even whiteness. The radio announcer advises that \"a storm warning is in effect for northern New England. We'll be seeing some snow this afternoon, turning to sleet and freezing rain later in the evening, so stay off the roads if you can help it.\"</span></p> <p><span>A cop holds up mid-afternoon traffic on Elm Street for fifteen minutes, and a woman leans out the window of her Chevy to ask what is going on. The Bush motorcade appears in the distance, approaches, passes by at twenty miles an hour. Eleven police cars with flashing lights, then the six press vans, the Secret Service, the Buicks full of aides, the ambulance, finally the President's limo and then more police.</span></p> <p><span>A four block-long ACT-UP rally marches down Chestnut Street, and both demonstrators and cops are uniformed in black leather jackets. A sign above a parking garage has a 1-800 number for NRA Whitetail Tours. Harry's Auto Parts boasts \"Everyone Has Their Priorities and You're Ours.\"</span></p> <p><span>Campaign workers with signs compete for street corners. A Honda with a pencil-shaped \"Write In Ralph Nader\" sign strapped to the roof is parked in front of a meter that reads \"Time Expired.\" On the sidewalk, a local television reporter interviews a silver-haired man, who says into the camera, \"Harkin isn't stiff; he seems like a relaxed, regular guy. He betrays a certain barnyard roughness around the edges, I suppose, but he can communicate with the everyday American.\"</span></p> <p><span>Two blocks away, in the Manchester headquarters for the Harkin campaign, Andrew Morin is looking for some volunteers. \"Is anybody up for a straight lit drop?\" he cries. Three college students just back from canvassing raise their hands: yes, they'll do a lit drop, but they need a ride. Volunteers keep returning from assignments and Morin's job is to get them back to work. Every five minutes he comes around: how'd you like to phone bank? how'd you like to canvass? you guys want to do some visibility?</span></p> <p><span>There can't be any standing around with three days to go.</span></p> <p><span>The headquarters is one long room, a former storefront with the green floor tiles peeling up and coming loose. There are eight battered wooden desks with telephones, stacks of brochures, a table piled with sodas and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, a fax machine, a Canon copier and a coffee maker at work.</span></p> <p><span>There is a six-foot-high map of Manchester on the wall with polling places circled in red. Next to the map is taped the battle plan for the final week of this campaign. Wednesday: all day canvass with phone banks. Thursday: yard sign blitz, last day to fax list of identified supporters to Concord office. Friday: field continues to throw decks and fold in new supporters, focus on plant gates. Saturday: GOTV (get out the vote) efforts continue. Election day: ward coordinators meet at targeted polling place, dispatchers come on duty and forward rider requests to drivers, maintain visibility at key locations.</span></p> <p><span>Chad Kister comes back from a morning of canvassing. He wears a plastic Uncle Sam hat with a Harkin bumper sticker, a secondhand herring-bone overcoat, high-top sneakers. The question he receives most often when knocking on doors is \"Why did you come all the way out here?\" Kister took a week off from classes at Ohio State and had to reschedule a midterm to work for the Harkin campaign. In Cleveland, he hitched a ride on a bus of Harkin supporters from Iowa.</span></p> <p><span>In his pocket, Kister has a stack of computer-generated cards bearing the names and addresses of all the Democrats and Independents in his assigned sector. On these cards he records a resident's likeliness to vote, preferred candidate and most strongly felt campaign issue. He visits one hundred houses a day; someone is home at maybe thirty. Of these, half are undecided and of those he might bring four or five into the Harkin camp. One day's work.</span></p> <p><span>When he finishes with these cards, he will turn them in for more. The cards will be tallied by the two senior citizens working inthe back room. Supporters are phoned on electionday and offered a ride, undecideds will be visitedagain tomorrow. In this primary, no candidaterelies on television spots to do the job. It takesold-fashioned shoe-leather politics. Every votethat Harkin gets represents one or two visits by acampaign worker, several phone calls and brochuresstuffed in the mailbox.</span></p> <p><span>The information gathered in Manchester is fedto the main headquarters in Concord, twentyminutes north of Manchester on I-93. In Concord,there are more battered desks, newspaper clippingsand maps on the wall. Plus a television.</span></p> <p><span>At the Concord headquarters, Kimberly Dias issurrounded by telephone books. A junior at St.Paul's, she has been coming in every Saturdaynight for three months. \"I belong to the WinentSociety. W-i-n-e-n-t, I think that's how it'sspelled. We have lots of societies, and we'reencouraged to volunteer in a campaign. You learn alot,\" she says. Not well-versed enough in theissues to phone bank, she sorts cards, highlightsmaps, distributes brochures and does visibility,which means standing with a Harkin sign in apublic place.</span></p> <p><span>Susan Goodwin gives a quick tour. Here is thedirector's office, this is the press room,downstairs we have scheduling and constituencies.\"This is Lois, who does Central America and Peaceand I don't know what-all. This is Carol, who doeswomen's issues, and Barbara, who handles unions.\"Two aides sit studying an architectural drawing;one is saying \"And he doesn't want co-ax drapedall through the fucking house either. This guy isa giver, and the boss says the job has to betight.\"</span></p> <p><span>The headquarters is relatively empty becausemost of the workers have been bused to theSomerset Clarion Hotel in Nashua, where Harkinwill speak to the United Auto Workers' dinner atseven. It is snowing. The New Hampshire road crewshaven't salted or plowed yet, and the traffic onI-93 goes fifteen miles an hour under the minimumspeed limit of forty-five. The New HampshireLiquor Store/Rest Stops aren't doing much businesstonight.</span></p> <p><span>At the Clarion, the reporters wait in the lobbyfor Harkin to arrive. Lars, a reporter for CBS,types notes into his laptop. He has followedHarkin around all day for three weeks, first inIowa and now here, and \"has heard the stump seventhousand times.\" He travels with Ju-Ju, hiscounterpart at ABC, who is writing a postcard to afriend that just got engaged. Before she canfinish, she looks up, \"Oh shit, he's herealready.\"</span></p> <p><span>The Betacams and Nikons cluster around Harkinas he enters, and the usual questions get theusual replies. \"Senator, what do you say aboutpolls that you are running in a race for thirdwith Kerrey?\"</span></p> <p><span>\"I don't pay attention to polls,\" he shootsback.</span></p> <p><span>\"Senator, what do you think about Kerrey'sads?\"</span></p> <p><span>\"They're nothing compared to what Bush willthrow at us.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Senator, would you be insulted if yourcolleagues drafted a nominee?\"</span></p> <p><span>\"The nominee is in the race and you are lookingat him.\"</span></p> <p><span>Harkin enters the ballroom to the cheers ofunion members and the flashes of pocket cameras,shakes hands, waves, sits down to dinner. Theunion leader goes to the podium and starts theintroduction just as the Chicken Kiev is beingserved. This is bad timing, because Harkin willstart speaking to the clinking of silverware,people will stop eating out of politeness, and thechicken and potatoes will grow cold and be leftuneaten.</span></p> <p><span>Harkin rises, goes to the microphone. He firstthanks the union leader and several other bigwigs.\"He's been with me since the very beginning...Shehas done tremendous work for the union...He is mylong-time friend and supporter.\" He is reading thenames off note cards an aide slipped him as hestepped to the podium.</span></p> <p><span>Bush is staying in this hotel tonight, andHarkin quips, \"This is the closest the Presidentwill get to organized labor.\" The crowd loves it.Harkin sweeps into his stump. He is preaching tothe converted.</span></p> <p><span>\"How many of you saw the State of the Unionaddress?\" Boos. \"Well you didn't miss a damnthing!\" Cheers.</span></p> <p><span>\"Let's talk trickle down economics.\" Boos.\"It's like trying to feed the birds by giving moreoats to the horse!\" Cheers.</span></p> <p><span>The crowd punctuates the speech withinterjections, like worshippers urging on theminister.</span></p> <p><span>\"My father was a coal miner, my mother was animmigrant.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"You're our kind of guy!\"</span></p> <p><span>\"If you are a junk bond dealer, it's the bestof times.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Yes, that's right!\"</span></p> <p><span>\"But if you are an out of work family, it's theworst of times.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"You tell `em!\"</span></p> <p><span>\"It's time to build a new America.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"We'll help ya!\"</span></p> <p><span>\"I do not intend to put Bush's feet by thefire, I intend to put them in the fire.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Give `em hell, Tom!\"</span></p> <p><span>\"I will and they deserve if.\"</span></p> <p><span>Harkin pulls out a newspaper clipping and putson his glasses. \"At a grocers' convention,President Bush was amazed by the bar-code readersat the checkout counters. These readers have beenin use for over eleven years.\" Laughter. \"Whatelse has Bush missed during his years inWashington? The Detroit Free Press said he lookedlike a `preppie Rip Van Winkle.\"'</span></p> <p><span>After the speech, the journalists joke with thepress secretary Lorraine Voles. Adam, USA Today'schief reporter covering the Democrats, didn't likeHarkin's potshots at Clinton and Kerrey: that \"youwon't find my face on a tabloid, and you won'tfind me dating any Hollywood girlfriends.\" Adamsays, \"Lorraine, why doesn't he add `Hey, I've gottwo legs and I've never had cancer!\"' Voleslaughs, but at Harkin's next speech the lines willbe dropped.</span></p> <p><span>Adam is a veteran of the campaign. \"Yeah, Ijust came to see Harkin before he is finished.He's the only one that isn't bullshittingcompletely. Tsongas? He's as much fun as going tochurch.\" The reporters mostly know each other, butthey introduce themselves to newcomers. \"Who youwith? How long you been up here? You doing awraparound or just a focus?\" Lars, Ju-Ju and someothers will catch Harkin's next stump across town;the rest are heading to the party for the press atSt. Anne's.</span></p> <p><span>An hour later, Harkin stumps at the NashuaSpartan Hall, a bingo hall. A Harkin banner coversthe electronic Bingo scoreboard in front, thetables have been moved to the rear. The generalpublic was invited to this speech, and Harkindoesn't have the unconditional cheering he had atthe hotel, but he gets them going with the preppieRip Van Winkle bit.</span></p> <p><span>After the speech, a group of five collegestudents vamp on Harkin's themes: when you buy acar, what are you paying for, labor or CEOs?...this country has almost no tariffs right now,basically none... we're not producing anything inthis country... national moratorium onforeclosures... economic conversion...compassionate government... manufacturing base...universal health care... high-speed rail...</span></p> <p><span>In a few days, busloads of Iowans will headback home.

I'm running to be president, and there's a difference,\" said Tsongas, referring to his opposition to the middle-class tax cut proposed by Bush and his Democratic rivals.</span></p> <p><span>Tsongas, speaking before an uproarious crowd at Razzberrys Restaurant, tried to distinguish himself further from his more liberal opponents.</span></p> <p><span>\"You can't be pro-jobs and anti-business at the same time,\" said Tsongas, who admitted he needs a strong showing next week in the South Dakota and Maryland primaries to prove he is more than a regional candidate.</span></p> <p><span>\"You cannot love employment and hate employers,\" Tsongas said.</span></p> <p><span>Tsongas' aides agreed and said his challenge now is to expand his campaign in to the South and the West, where he is relatively unknown.</span></p> <p><span>\"He feels very overwhelmed that New Hampshire got behind his message,\" said Peggy Connolly, Tsongas' press secretary. \"And it gives him the confidence to leave New Hampshire and tell it to the rest of this country.\"</span></p> <p><span>A similar task confronts Republican challenger Patrick J. Buchanan, who won more than 40 percent of the vote yesterday.</span></p> <p><span>\"We are going to take our party back,\" said Buchanan, who plans to campaign in Georgia, Texas and Louisiana later this month.</span></p> <p><span>\"And when we take our party back, we'll take the country back,\" Buchanan told an enthusiastic group of supporters who chanted, \"Read our lips, no second term.\"</span></p> <p><span>But advisers said that regardless of how Buchanan fares in other states, his showing here is a warning to President Bush.</span></p> <p><span>\"This is a strong signal to the American public,\" said Angela Bay Buchanan, the candidate's campaign manager and sister.</span></p> <p><span>At a campaign celebration in Merrimack, Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton said he was proud of his second-place showing and of his rebound from recent polls that showed him trailing Tsongas by as many as 20 percentage points.</span></p> <p><span>\"I think we know enough to say that New Hampshire tonight has made Bill Clinton the come-back kid,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>Clinton also said he had done what he could to counter allegations made last month of extramarital affairs and Vietnam War draft-dodging.</span></p> <p><span>\"The hit that I took in this election is nothing compared to the hits the people of New Hampshire are taking each day,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>And his campaign aides said they look forward to running nationally against frontrunner Tsongas, whose appeal may be limited outside the Northeast.</span></p> <p><span>\"It's now a two-person race,\" said George Burno, co-chair of the Clinton campaign here.</span></p> <p><span>\"We'll go to Maine...but then the campaign moves to the South-Bill Clinton's turf,\" Burno said.</span></p> <p><span>But late last night, the second tier of Democratic hopefuls were still battling it out for third-place.</span></p> <p><span>Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey, addressing an exuberant audience at the Sheraton Wayfarer in Bedford, assured his supporters that he was committed to continuing his campaign.</span></p> <p><span>\"We may not quite be golden yet, but bronze ain't bad,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>Kerrey's campaign aides and supporters agreed that their candidate's third place finish was important in the upcoming race.</span></p> <p><span>\"Tsongas has had the local advantage, and Clinton has dominated the press coverage,\" said campaign manager Tadd Levine. \"We'll continue to build not only for the nomination but also the general election.\"</span></p> <p><span>Attacking Bush's health care, economic and educational policies, Kerrey expressed confidence about winning the Democratic nomination and the general election.</span></p> <p><span>\"It breaks my heart to see what Bush has done to this country,\" said Kerrey, strongly <u>New Hampshire Primaries 1992 </u></span></p> <p><span>With 97% of precincts reporting, returns show Paul Tsongas as the Democratic winner and George Bush as the Republican winner in the New Hampshire primaries.</span></p> <p><span><b>Democratic Party</b> <b>Candidate\u00a0\u00a0Votes\u00a0\u00a0Percentage\u00a0\u00a0Delegate s</b> Jerry Brown\u00a0\u00a012,784\u00a0\u00a09%\u00a0\u00a00 Bill Clinton\u00a0\u00a038,365\u00a0\u00a026%\u00a0\u00a09 Mario Cuomo\u00a0\u00a05,128\u00a0\u00a03%\u00a0\u00a00 Tom Harkin\u00a0\u00a015,569\u00a0\u00a011%\u00a0\u00a00 Bob Kerrey\u00a0\u00a017,085\u00a0\u00a012%\u00a0\u00a00 Tom Laughlin\u00a0\u00a02,069\u00a0\u00a01%\u00a0\u00a00 Ralph Nader\u00a0\u00a02,445\u00a0\u00a02%\u00a0\u00a00 <b>Paul Tsongas\u00a0\u00a050,903\u00a0\u00a034%\u00a0\u00a09</b> Others\u00a0\u00a03,499\u00a0\u00a02%\u00a0\u00a00</span></p> <p><span><b>Republican Party</b> <b>Candidate\u00a0\u00a0Votes\u00a0\u00a0Percentage\u00a0\u00a0Delegate s</b> Patrick Buchanan\u00a0\u00a059,426\u00a0\u00a041%\u00a0\u00a09 <b>George Bush\u00a0\u00a083,415\u00a0\u00a057%\u00a0\u00a014</b> Others\u00a0\u00a02,754\u00a0\u00a02%\u00a0\u00a00 Source: The Associated Press  <t>criticizing the president's last term.\"Buchanan may have bloodied his nose, but we'regoing to knock him out in November '92.\"<p>At his campaign celebration in Manchester, IowaSen.

{"title": "Elm Street Insanity | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>M</b>ANCHESTER, N.H.--It was a nightmare.</span></p> <p><span>A guru campaigning for a Sacred Cockroach. A pack of supporters carrying signs for a write-in candidate named Larry Head who bore a strong resemblance to Julius Caesar. A move to draft former New Hampshire Gov. and White House Chief of Staff John Sununu into the campaign.</span></p> <p><span>Passers-by and mainstream campaigners on Elm Street, the main artery here in the Granite State's largest city, saw all these things as voters went to the polls around the state--or at least they thought they saw them.</span></p> <p><span>\"I don't know where [the unusual campaigners] came from,\" muttered Renee Bonner, a local woman holding a sign for Sen. Bob Kerrey at the corner of Elm and Merrimack. \"And I don't really know their message.\"</span></p> <p><span>But conveying a message was not the first priority of demonstrators yesterday; they were simply interested in getting attention for one last-ditch effort to attract support for their respective candidates. All the major candidates had large representations along the busy thoroughfare, but those groups were joined by those favoring minor candidates, non-candidates or no candidates at all.</span></p> <p><span>The commotion on Elm Street was overwhelming for some residents.</span></p> <p><span>\"I've never seen anything like this in all my life,\" said Virginia A. Murray, 69, a life-long Manchester resident. She said the streets are usually empty in the late afternoon of election day.</span></p> <p><span>A giant cockroach, which appeared to be a large painted chair atop a rusty red Radio Flyer wagon and adorned with signs reading \"Kiss me,\" attracted the attention of passer-bys and several camera crews. The insect was led by three people dressed in togas, scraps of multi-colored cloth and a boot--on one of the men's head. All were running for president, but two--Guru Bonanza Swank and the Rev. Red Moses--had endorsed the cockroach.</span></p> <p><span>When questioned about why the cockroach and the men were running for office, one of the gurus, going by the name Vermin Supreme, replied, \"It's obvious.\" However, Supreme mumbled more specific reasons too quickly to be understood by listeners.</span></p> <p><span>When two police officers nearby saw that the \"cockroach\" was blocking the sidewalk, they questioned Supreme about the boot on his head.</span></p> <p><span>\"If the boot fits, wear it,\" he responded immediately.</span></p> <p><span>But not all was utopian bliss for the cockroach supporters. Later in the day, they became entangled in a brief verbal confrontation with six supporters of Larry Head, a candidate whose name did not appear on either party's primary ballot.</span></p> <p><span>But more serious demonstrations took place, as well. The AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power stationed members of their organization on street corners holding signs reading \"Bush Gets Away With Murder: One AIDS Death Every Seven Minutes,\" and \"Honk if you hate Bush.\" Passing drivers honked every few seconds, including at least one bus driver.</span></p> <p><span>One door down, however, a bookstore called for a different Republican longshot to be elected.</span></p> <p><span>\"No more wimps! Draft Iron John Sununu for President!\" screamed signs in the windows of Amoskeag Books. According to Bill Petch, an employee, owner Laurie Saxon came up with the idea for the placards last week after considering all the announced candidates.</span></p> <p><span>\"She thought Sununu would be the better president,\" Petch said.</span></p> <p><span>Sununu visited the store after the signs went up Saturday, and was pleasant but modest, he said.</span></p> <p><span>\"He told us if we really wanted to help, we should support the president,\" Petch said, adding that a White House driver and photographer were sent to record the display.</span></p> <p><span>Petch also said the signs have brought much attention, mostly from the press. \"Several people have asked up for bumper stickers,\" Petch said. \"Someone said we'd been seen on Japanese television, though I can't vouch for that.\"</span></p> <p><span>But while the excitement up and down Elm provided grist for reporters, many were nonplussed by the crowds. After passing through the circus-like scene, one voter intentionally kicked over a public garbage can.</span></p> <p><span>\"This is a fucking insane asylum,\" the man muttered as he stepped into the relative sanity of the polls to cast his vote.</span></p>"}

Baker III and Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev also agreed on accelerated high-level talks toward an accord to sharply reduce their long-range nuclear arsenals, Kozyrev said.</span></p> <p><span>Baker and Kozyrev decided to jettison the cumbersome arms control negotiating procedures of the Cold War, which involved large teams of experts working for years to reach agreement--if at all. They agreed instead to conduct the negotiations themselves with a completion goal of July, when President Bush and Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin meet in Washington.</span></p> <p><span>The two will hold another round of talks on March 10 on the sidelines of a NATO foreign ministers' meeting in Brussels, a U.S. official said.</span></p> <p><span><b>Russia Protests Submarine Collision</b></span></p> <p><span>MOSCOW--The commonwealth navy charged yesterday that a nuclear-powered U.S. submarine was secretly in Russian waters when it collided with a Soviet sub last week. U.S. officials said the crash occurred in international waters.</span></p> <p><span>The subdued but unambiguous Russian anger over the underwater bump on February 11 in the Barents Sea, near the Arctic Ocean, was a throwback to Cold War rivalries and a reminder of the powerful weapons the countries still have deployed against each other.</span></p> <p><span>No injuries were reported to the crew members of either submarine.</span></p> <p><span>Both subs were nuclear powered and capable of carrying nuclear weapons, but neither side would say whether the ships were loaded at the time.</span></p> <p><span>U.S. and Russian officials said that though there was no radiation leakage, both vessels suffered some damage.</span></p> <p><span>\"The fact that a foreign submarine should be secretly operating within our territorial waters is bound to cause concern in the Russian leadership,\" Adm.

{"title": "Keeping Out the Riffraff | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>O</b>NCE AGAIN, President Bush has responded swiftly and decisively to an international crisis. To the leaders of an illegitimate coup in Haiti, the heirs of the Duvaliers and the brutal <i>tontons-macoutes,</i> he has quietly acquiesced. But to thousands of fleeing Haitians, Bush has again sent his fighting message: This will not stand.</span></p> <p><span>More than 15,000 Haitians have risked death while unknown numbers have died trying to escape the new junta led by General Raoul Cedras. Unless the Supreme Court or Congress intervenes, and unless the president improbably changes his mind (he's no wimp, after all), most of these refugees--tired, hungry, poor, yearning to be free, etc.--will soon be back in the hands of the Duvalierists. In the last week alone, 3402 have been summarily repatriated.</span></p> <p><span>The administration claims that the Haitians face no danger on returning. Secretary of State James A. Baker III says that there is no evidence that the present government is persecuting repatriated Haitians. When each boat arrives, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) identifies the tiny minority in genuine danger, the \"political refugees,\" and allows them to stay here, at least for the moment.</span></p> <p><span>The rest--the proverbial bad apples who only want a better life and face no special dangers at home--are the mere \"economic migrants\" who get sent home. The United States can only afford to absorb immigrants who face imminent danger, and most Haitian boat people simply do not.</span></p> <p><span>So the story goes--falsely, cynically, cruelly. The U.S. military transfers the repatriates to the famously brutal Haitian military, which photographs and fingerprints each refugee beneath an Orwellian \"Welcome to Haiti\" sign. Perhaps the Bush administration believes that the Cedras regime will use the prints and photos to make invitations for a \"Welcome to Haiti\" party for the repatriates. This belief would explain why the administration slowed the return of refugees--not to assuage human rights concerns, but to accommodate a Cedras regime which needed more time to process bodies.</span></p> <p><span>Scores of refugees, already returned to Haiti once, have made the treacherous escape a second time. Though identified by the INS as \"economic migrants,\" they report having faced imprisonment, torture and death on their repatriation.</span></p> <p><span>Because it has received assurances from the Cedras junta that it would never do such nasty things, however, the administration has effectively called these people liars. In their defense, Amnesty International reports that more than 1500 people have died since the coup in September. Still, all these folks could be lying. And Cedras could be telling the truth. And Lyndon Larouche could be the next president.</span></p> <p><span>If poverty were driving Haitians to flee the poorest country in the Western hemisphere, presumably they would have been escaping for years. In fact, relatively few Haitians fled even during the Duvalier regime--Reagan returned most of them, you can be sure--but thousands are coming now.</span></p> <p><span>The administration says that the Organization of American States embargo has driven Haitians to desperation, but few refugees agree. In any case, they have been coming since September, before it could have had any effect. They have been fleeing ever since the political situation at home became the daily terror the United States has condoned in Haiti.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE ADMINISTRATION advertises its moral bankruptcy in its current brief before the Supreme Court, which will decide the fate of many of the refugees this week. Bush's Solicitor General, Kenneth Starr, argues in the brief that challenges to repatriation from human rights advocates and religious organizations represent an \"unprecedented assault\" on executive power. Executive privilege is the last refuge of scoundrels--just ask Richard Nixon or Ollie North. The appeal to legality before morality, however, fits nicely with the refugee/migrant distinction. It clears the conscience--and Guantanamo Bay, where the refugees are waiting--without doing any good for the Haitians who face the Cedras welcoming committee, much less for Haiti itself.</span></p> <p><span>The president also contends that allowing these Haitians to enter the U.S. would open the floodgates for thousands more. It's sort of a Domino Theory for the '90s. But he need not choose between repatriating thousands of Haitians and absorbing thousands more. Using his executive power, the president can declare Haiti a disaster situation and grant Haitians \"temporary protected status.\" A bill in Congress, sponsored by Representative Romano L. Mazzoli of Kentucky, would force the president to grant TPS to all Haitian refugees. They would be allowed to stay in Guantanamo--hardly a reward which would draw others--until Haiti restored democracy and human rights, when they would be returned.</span></p> <p><span>TPS would not send Haitians a message that they can get free passage to America (shudder). It would, however, prevent them from getting shot by marauding soldiers at home. And it would send the leaders of those soldiers the message that America means business about restoring a regime which commands Haitians' overwhelming support.</span></p> <p><span>The Bush administration does not wish to send this message, however. Last Tuesday, the day after repatriation began, it announced that it was \"fine-tuning\" the embargo against Haiti, saying that it hurt poor Haitians with-out weakening the Cedras regime. (sort of a South Africa excuse for the '90s.)</span></p> <p><span>A few days later, The Washington Post revealed that U.S. business leaders had pressured the administration to relax the sanctions. Most poor Haitians say they will suffer anything to get back their beloved leader, Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide. The New York Times captured the junta's response to the Bush move in a simple headline: \"Leaders of Coup Gleeful After U.S. Loosens Its Embargo.\"</span></p> <p><span>In response to the U.S. message, Cedras promptly promoted several soldiers in a move the Bush administration represented as \"disciplining.\" Not disciplining the army, though, but the people--several of these men were involved in Baby Doc's regime. A triumphant Haitian aristocrat announced in appropriately obscure language: \"We are heading in the direction of absorbing this crisis.\" He is right.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>NYONE STUPID ENOUGH to believe Bush's rhetoric about a New World Order would be surprised at his old world politics. The democratic regime is simply too far left and Haiti too small to elicit an impassioned response from Bush. Though not a communist, Aristide is a left-wing priest, steeped in liberation theology, known and adored in the ghetto that is most of Port-au-Prince. (His beautiful little book is called <i>In the Precincts of the Poor.</i>)</span></p> <p><span>Bush did not support his election, only tepidly aided his tottering government once it was in power and instead of teaching it about human right, harangued it after it had been deposed.</span></p> <p><span>Now the administration thinks it has nothing to gain from restoring Aristide. Unnamed officials smugly told The Washington Post last week: \"What incentive do we have to help Haiti? What for? What U.S. interest?\" Too bad Cedras is not a communist and Aristide a little more moderate--better yet, an oil mogul of some sort. Then Haiti would get a Grenada or Kuwait invasion.</span></p> <p><span>Instead it gets nothing. On the docks a refugee says. \"We voted for a president, and they took him away. Now there is nothing we can do.\" Nothing but board the boat and meet your Bush-backed leader. Nothing.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Bush Takes N.H. Primary Over a Strong Buchanan | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>MANCHESTER, N.H.--In the first-in-the-nation primaries here yesterday, conservative commentator Patrick J. Buchanan won a surprising 41 percent of the vote, while former Massachusetts Sen. Paul E. Tsongas emerged victorious in the Democratic primary.</span></p> <p><span>Both candidates said last night that they viewed the results as a message condemning President Bush's performance in Washington.</span></p> <p><span>Though Bush topped Buchanan with 57 percent of the vote, the commentator's strong showing dealt the president an embarrassing blow in the Republican contest. Buchanan campaign aides said they see the outcome, determined with 70 percent of precincts reporting, as a reflection of Republicans' desire for change.</span></p> <p><span>Buchanan captured nine of the 23 New Hampshire delegates who will go to the Republican National Convention in August.</span></p> <p><span>Tsongas said he was satisfied with his 34-percent finish, though his principal rival, Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, finished in better position than expected, with 26 percent of the Democratic vote. The race for third was unresolved for several hours after polls closed last night. With 97 percent of all precincts reporting, Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey had 12 percent, Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin had 11 percent and former California Gov. Edmund G. Brown, Jr. tallied nine percent.</span></p> <p><span>Tsongas and Clinton evenly split the state's 18 delegates to the Democratic National Convention, which will take place in July.</span></p> <p><span>New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, who was the subject of an active though unsolicited write-in compaign, gathered only three percent of the total vote. Consumer advocate Ralph Nader received two percent and actor Tom Laughlin, who starred in the \"Billy Jack\" movies, non one percent.</span></p> <p><span>At his victory rally last night, Buchanan likened his supporters to members of an army battling the Washington Republican establishment.</span></p> <p><span>\"Now we must go forward,\" Buchanan said to a packed room at a restaurant south of Manchester. \"What began as a little rebellion has emerged...as a full-fledged American revolution.\"</span></p> <p><span>Buchanan stopped short of discussing the general election at his celebration, but emphasized the need for success in the southern states on March 10, known as Super Tuesday.</span></p> <p><span>\"Now that the great battle of New Hampshire is won, we face the battle of the South,\" Buchanan said.</span></p> <p><span>Bush, who remained at the White House all day yesterday, cancelled a scheduled ession with reporters last night. He issued a written statement, however, which did not claim victory and which suggested his disappointment with the support shown for Buchanan.</span></p> <p><span>\"This election was for closer than many had predicted,\" Bush said in the statement. \"I think the opponents on both sides reaped the harvest of New Hamp-shire's economy.\"</span></p> <p><span>William Bennett, a former Bush cabinet member, said in a Cable News Network interview that the President will have to recognize Buchanan as a serious threat and to form an aggressive campaign in the race for the nomination.</span></p> <p><span>\"Kinder and gentler is over,\" Bennett said.</span></p> <p><span>Historical precedents for the significance of Buchanan's victory are mixed. No incumbent president who gave up more than 35 percent of the New Hampshire vote has won the general election since World War II, but at the same time, no president has been elected without first winning New Hampshire since 1952. <t><p>In the 1968 elections, Sen. Eugene J. McCarthycaptured 42 percent of the Democratic vote againstincumbent Lyndon B. Johnson in New Hampshire.Three weeks later, Johnson announced that he wouldnot seek re-election.</p><p>Exit polls indicated that more than half ofthose who voted for Buchanan did so \"to send amessage.\" Only 48 percent of his voters said theythought he was the best candidate, according toCNN.</p><p>Tsongas, like Buchanan, called his victory anaffront to politics-as-usual.</p><p>\"Washington, we are sending you a message: Justtell us the truth,\" Tsongas said last night,flanked by his wife, sisters, and children. \"We'regrown-ups. We can deal with it. We can overcomeit. Give us vision. Give us truth.\"</p><p>Tsongas also said his victory was a two-prongedmessage to Democrats. \"We honor and cherish thecommitment to individual rights and theenvironment,\" he said. \"That is our heart and thatis our soul.\"</p><p>\"America does not trust [Democrats] with theeconomy,\" Tsongas continued. \"That is the truthand that has to change.\"</p><p>The candidate raised both fists clenched invictory several times when his speech was stoppedby applause. Tsongas maintained his usual drysense of humor, chiding the crowd for interruptinghim with \"We want Paul\" chants at one point.</p><p>When a phone rang off stage, Tsongasdeadpanned, \"Answer the phone and tell George Bushhe cannot concede till November.\"</p><p>And Tsongas continued to join other Democratsand Republicans in criticizing the President theyall hope to unseat in November. Tsongasspecifically mentioned Bush's 1988 advertisementsthat featured furloughed criminal Willie Horton.</p><p>The ads, which Bush said he intended tocriticize his opponent Michael S.

{"title": "Burning Bush | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>F</b>OUR YEARS ago, George Bush won the presidency despite himself.</span></p> <p><span>He won because his campaign brain trust--Lee Atwater, James Baker, Roger Ailes And Robert Teeter--discovered the political might of Willie Horton, the pledge of allegiance and the American flag. Armed with nothing mightier than symbols or slogans, Bush's campaign handlers played the electorate like Atwater used to play blues guitar.</span></p> <p><span>But Atwater died last year at the age of 40 from a brain tumor. Ailes has retired from politics. Baker is busy running the State Department. Of the Big Four behind Bush's 1988 campaign, Teeter is the only one who is involved in Bush's re-election effort.</span></p> <p><span>And it's a re-election effort that's going badly and only getting worse. Why? The answer, surprisingly, can be found in the Bible.</span></p> <p><span><b>G</b>EORGE MAY BE the most famous Bush in today's world, but in a world-historical sense he runs a distance second.</span></p> <p><span>Number one, of course, is the bush that burned in the Sinai desert some 3500 years ago, an event that was recorded in the Bible and has been ever since the subject of an inordinate amount of religious interpretation.</span></p> <p><span>But the burning bush has been largely ignored as a subject of political interpretation, especially in contemporary American politics. That's a sin, because the Biblical bush can provide great insight into the presidential Bush, and specifically into his re-election campaign this year.</span></p> <p><span>We all know the story. Moses is out doing the shepherd thing near Mt. Sinai when he happens upon a bush that is burning but not being consumed by fire. His interest aroused, Moses approaches the shrub. God then announces his presence to the prophet.</span></p> <p><span>In the ensuing conversation, God commands Moses to lead the Israelites out of Egypt and into the Promised Land. The shepherd, however, isn't too keen on the job. He's not sure that he could convince even the Israelites, let alone Pharaoh, that he has truly been sent by the Lord to deliver Israel from the house of bondage. What should he tell the people, Moses asks, when they question him and ask him the name of God?</span></p> <p><span>God's famous reply: \"I am who I am.\" That, God says, is his name for all eternity. That's what Moses should tell the Israelites.</span></p> <p><span>Moses finally agrees to do God's bidding and ultimately leads the Israelites out of Egypt. The Israelites settle in the Land of Israel, build a couple of temples and are expelled from Israel after the Romans sack the second one in 70 A.D. Nearly 2000 years later, Zionists return to the Land and begin building houses in the West Bank, which really pisses off George Bush, 42nd president of the United States.</span></p> <p><span>But that's not the point of the story.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE POINT IS that the presidential Bush could never utter the same worlds that came forth from the burning bush: \"I am who I am.\"</span></p> <p><span>That's because, politically, George Bush is nothing. Once an advocate of Planned Parenthood and a critic of \"voodoo economics,\" he's now an anti-choice basher and a supply side disciple. He's a champion of political expedience and ambition--and not much else.</span></p> <p><span>While the shallowness of Bush's political views has been recognized by political pundits for years, the \"vision thing\" has a potential for hurting Bush in '92 like never before.</span></p> <p><span>It's one thing to get Moses to believe you when he's out tending his sheep. But it's a different story when Moses has no sheep to tend, when he can't find a job, when his wife is laid off, when his family has no medical insurance and when his kids don't have enough food to eat, let alone money to pay for a college education. When times are bad--like they are these days in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, California and across the nation--the American electorate is a much harder audience to please.</span></p> <p><span>It is possible, of course, that the same sort of divinely-inspired political wizardry offered by the Bush campaign in '88 would be enough to do the job again this November.</span></p> <p><span>With three-quarters of the Baker-Atwater-Ailes-Teeter team gone, though, and no one with comparable experience running campaigns in his re-election staff, Bush probably can't do it. The president needed a thousand points of political brilliance to win in 1988. Then, he was dangerously behind in New Hampshire until attacking front-runner Bob Dole with \"Senator Straddle\" ads and in the general election attacking Dukakis with Willie Horton pieces. And back then, the economy was in much better shape.</span></p> <p><span>The other option, of course, is to present Americans with a real, well-articulated political agenda for a second term. That means ideas, principles, a domestic agenda--in short, the \"vision thing.\" But that route is of no use for a politician like Bush, for whom saying \"I am who I am\" is meaningless.</span></p> <p><span><b>R</b>ONALD REAGAN was a natural burning bush, a candidate with a core of deep-set political belief and a particularly effective way of articulating them. So was John F. Kennedy '40. So, perhaps, is Pat Buchanan.</span></p> <p><span>When they're elected, substantive politicians like Reagan and JFK are able to ascend to the presidency with clear mandates for governance. Such was the case for Reagan in 1980 (though not in 1984) and for JFK in 1960. But Bush's vapid 1988 campaign left him with a mandate only for no new taxes, no furloughs for Black criminals, more flags and pork rinds for all.</span></p> <p><span>Fortunately for Bush, there have been plenty of big-ticket items to deal with in the foreign policy arena--his forte--which helped buoy his popularity ratings over the past three years.</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately for Bush, the country is now deep in a recession. People in America (the only country, it seems, whose problems he's ignored for the past four years) are hurting and angry. The president's response has been pathetic. First he denied the problem, then offered too little, too late in his overlyhyped State of the Union address. His jobs, jobs, jobs\" trip to Japan was a political fiasco that accomplished nothing. He campaigned in New Hampshire with the fuzziest of messages and without attacking Buchanan's upstart, highly-ideological campaign.</span></p> <p><span>The results of last week's New Hampshire primary show that Bush is paying the price for his past political expediency and present political ineptitude. The incumbent president garnered only 53 percent of the vote, while-Buchanan got 37 percent. Those aren't strong numbers for a sitting president.</span></p> <p><span>Even after the New Hampshire debacle, though, status quo politics still rule at the White House.</span></p> <p><span><b>S</b>TILL, BUSH is heavily favored to win the Republican nomination. And many of his would-be Democratic challengers face similar problems in defining the substance and style of their messages.</span></p> <p><span>But unless the economy improves soon in a significant way (which it may), the president will face an uphill battle to November's general election. This time around, Bush will have to convince voters that he'll make it easier for them to pay the bills, put food on the table and have access to affordable medical care. And he'll have to do it without the talents of Lee Atwater, James Baker and Roger Ailes.</span></p> <p><span>That will take a true miracle.</span></p>"}
{"title": "THE CHIC PHENOM OF THE '90s? | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Paul E. Tsongas was up early the morning following his victory in the New Hampshire primary. <i>The Today Show, Good Morning America and CBS This Morning</i>all wanted him on the airwaves.</span></p> <p><span>And after shaking hands with Bryant Gumbel and Charles Gibson, Tsongas later in the day met a slightly different television personality: David Letterman.</span></p> <p><span>It was fitting for the former senator from Massachusetts that he spend the evening celebrating with Letterman. The two have something in common.</span></p> <p><span>Letterman, despite his status as a cultural icon, continually reverts back to a standard routine of self-deprecating humor. He'll grumble about the paucity of viewers, lack of \"babes,\" etc.</span></p> <p><span>Similarly, Tsongas has spent the last few months reverting to his problems: lack of charisma and similarities with another Greek Democrat from Massachusetts.</span></p> <p><span>Since his very first election to the Lowell City Council, Tsongas has been known for his firm, generally liberal stands on a variety of issues, but never for his style. So the candidate who has been called droopy, boring, bland and uncharismatic has changed his approach--now he makes jokes about being droopy, boring, bland and uncharismatic.</span></p> <p><span>\"I intend to make lack of charisma the chic phenomenon of the '90s,\" Tsongas says.</span></p> <p><span>Setting national trends might not be easy for Tsongas. But playing the role of \"uncharismatic man\" certainly will.</span></p> <p><span>For one thing, there's his Elmer Fudd-like monotone, punctuated by a slight lisp and a twitch in his upper lip.</span></p> <p><span>Then there's the drooping jowls. He slumps. And his head always seems to be a tad off center. For good reasons, Tsongas seems uncomfortable standing at a podium.</span></p> <p><span>Tsongas' supporters, of course, point to substance of positions and intellectual integrity as attributes far more important than appearance on a podium.</span></p> <p><span>But even when it comes to substance, Tsongas, who refers constantly to his 86-page manifesto <i>A Call to Economic Arms</i> tends to get bogged down in his favorite subject: solving America's economic problems.</span></p> <p><span>This turned out to be a big plus in New Hampshire where voters weary of the recession gave him a victory in the first primary of the 1992 race for the Democratic nomination.</span></p> <p><span>But Tsongas faces what could be a tougher battle against Bill Clinton, his nearest competitor in New Hampshire, when the two vie for votes in the South and Midwest, where citizens may be looking less for economic realities and more for a touch of flair.</span></p> <p><span>Clinton, meanwhile, in his fifth term as governor of Arkansas, is the smoothest of the smooth. While media critics were accusing Tsongas of being bland in the last few months, Clinton drew fire for allegedly sleeping around on his wife.,</span></p> <p><span>Few have charged Bill Clinton of being boring.</span></p> <p><span>And even after Tsongas beat Clinton by eight percentage points in the New Hampshire primary, the Massachusetts Democrat seemed to take his victory less well than Clinton took a defeat.</span></p> <p><span>At his victory rally Tuesday night, Tsongas seemed awkward. Of course, few would be their most refined after winning an big election, but Tsongas' repeated fist-clenching arm-flexing gesticulations struck some as rehearsed.</span></p> <p><span>And from his first words, Tsongas' rhetoric perplexed many of those watching.</span></p> <p><span>After hugging his wife, Tsongas took the podium and said, \"Well, New Hampshire, you did it again. You gave them hell.\"</span></p> <p><span>Slightly inebriated party-goers erupted in joyous celebration, but several members of the national media and at least one campaign aide were seen turning to colleagues with a look that said, \"What was that supposed to mean?\"</span></p> <p><span>And Tsongas grew visibly frustrated as his victory speech was interrupted several times by chants, applause and supportive screams. The rally staples appeared to be causing him to lose his train of thought.</span></p> <p><span>\"Hey,\" he shot in the direction of one outburst, \"this is my speech.\"</span></p> <p><span>Still, Tsongas did go home that night the winner. And for a man who entered the race for the presidency 10 months ago to chuckles by a few and disregard by many (some called him Tstupid), Tsongas has truly accomplished something.</span></p> <p><span>For a man who can sometimes come across as an automation, Tsongas' brand of humor--unique to politics these days--may have something to do with his success.</span></p> <p><span>\"I came from a disadvantaged home,\" Tsongas likes to say at the beginning of his stump speech. \"My parents are Republicans.\"</span></p> <p><span>And in the age of spin doctors and sound bites, Tsongas filmed a television commercial of himself in a swimming pool.</span></p> <p><span>\"If you think it's tough to take on a president with a 90 percent rating, try being 50-years-old and having your picture taken in a Speedo bathing suit,\" reads one Tsongas campaign brochure. \"Now, that's courage.\"</span></p> <p><span>There is something endearing about Tsongas' Letterman-esque humor although, admittedly, he works a harder at it than Letterman needs to and the wit is not at the same level.</span></p> <p><span>Listen to Tsongas on President Bush:</span></p> <p><span>\"I started when George Bush was at 91 percent,\" he says referring to the president's popularity rating, \"and you've seen what I've done to him.\"</span></p> <p><span>On American cars, and the first car he bought, a Ford Pinto:</span></p> <p><span>\"The people who built this car, why do they hate me? What did I ever do?\" Tsongas asks in his stump speech. \"Then I bought a Chevy Vega. They hated me, too.\"</span></p> <p><span>Tsongas even jokes about his bout with cancer in the 1970s, when he retired from the U.S. Senate to undergo treatment.</span></p> <p><span>Of the time he told his kids that he would seek the presidency, Tsongas says, \"Their immediate thought was that I had gotten sick again. But we assured them it was much worse.\"</span></p> <p><span>And then there's the topic of one Michael S. Dukakis.</span></p> <p><span>The Duke, whose name has become a euphemism for the Democrats' woes in presidential politics despite capturing 47 percent of the vote in 1988, may be a slightly more sensitive topic for Tsongas.</span></p> <p><span>When Tsongas was unable to hear a question about the similarity to the former Massachusetts governor at one rally recently, the supporter had to repeat it.</span></p> <p><span>\"I'm sorry I heard you,\" Tsongas said dryly.</span></p> <p><span>\"When I got into this race, it was not because I thought the earth was crying for a Greek Democrat from Massachusetts to run,\" Tsongas has said in stump speeches.</span></p> <p><span>Still, Tsongas' humor is one way in which he tries to set himself apart from Dukakis, who often came across to voters as cold.</span></p> <p><span>Of course, Dukakis also is faulted for his inability to take the offensive when Bush's labelling of him as a liberal hurt him in the polls.</span></p> <p><span>And going on the offensive is something that Paul Tsongas is awfully serious about.</span></p> <p><span>So despite the obvious similarities between Dukakis and Tsongas in substance and in style, Tsongas appears to be making every effort to shake the comparison.</span></p> <p><span>And in an interview with The Crimson this week, Dukakis said he thinks the comparisons were mostly unfounded.</span></p> <p><span>\"Paul and I share some similarities, [but] we're obviously different people,\" he said. \"He has his style and I have mine.\"</span></p> <p><span>These days, Tsongas' style is in demand. His Letterman appearance, though it lasted only 61 seconds (as indicated by an on-screen clock to insure fairness to all candidates) and consisted of smiling and shaking hands but not speaking, demonstrates a fascination with this most recent addition to the national political scene.</span></p> <p><span>Tsongas and his wife, Nikki, had to be shooed off stage by Letterman when the politician began shaking hands with camera operators and audience members.</span></p> <p><span>Some have also rumored that Tsongas has been invited to appear as a guest host on Saturday Night Live, but that could not be confirmed this week.</span></p> <p><span>And while a drop from the presidential race to enter the world of stand-up comedy seems unlikely, it is clear his mixture of humor and politics have given Paul Tsongas a shot--at least a shot--at the presidency.</span></p>"}

{"title": "My Couple of Years | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b> HAVE OFFICIALLY been alive for two decades. I like to think that this is a pretty big achievements. Although two decades and a year would be a lot more fun for me, I'm willing to settle for the security of having progressed to the point in my life where I can do my own laundry.</span></p> <p><span>My problem is that our constant attention to decades and history and tracing the roots of humanity back thousands of years, the search for the beginning of the universe, the search for life on other planets--it all makes my existence seem insignificant. I am a fruit fly on the time line of history.</span></p> <p><span>What makes it worse is that we take so much time labeling all the previous eras and millennium of the world. Even the fact that we have names for all of these periods is disconcerting. Mesozoic, Cretaceous, Paleozoic, Cambrian. Who can name these periods except for kindergarteners who spend too much time hugging stuffed dinosaurs and trading erasers shaped like pre-historical animals?\"</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE LISTING of the great millennia always reminds me of the cross-sections of soil levels that we learned in science class. Topsoil, sedentary soil, shale coal, diamonds, oil, primordial sludge, fire brimstone the boogey monster and the other side of the globe.</span></p> <p><span>The message I always got from these lessons in the labeling of history was that eventually my fossilized skeleton was going to be squeezed and compressed towards the center of the earth where it would be sucked into the some unnatural and irrational void at the core of the planet. No wonder I became an English Major.</span></p> <p><span>But then, in that department we have our own way of labeling literary history--Middle English, Renaissance, Classicist, Romantic, Modernist, Post-Modernist, Neo-Classicist, Formalist, Structural, Post-Structural, Deconstructionist, Post-Literal, Post-Lingual. And we think that television is killing books.</span></p> <p><span>Of courses, the most common way that we label <i>our</i> time on this earth is by categorizing the human experience. In school, we chop history into neat lesson--plans the Civil War, the Progressive Era, the Depression, the World Wars. Our recent cultural history fits even more neatly into <i>People</i> magazine special issue topics or a Time-Life home series on American History.</span></p> <p><span>The Cold War, Baby Boomers, the Sixties, Disco, the Reagan Years, Desert Storm. A book each month. You don't have to pay until 1999. If you order now, you get special edition of the Al Franken Decade.</span></p> <p><span>The Al Franken Decade--now there's a label I can follow. Al Franken works beyond all the fuss turning our small world into the some model of all time. He's comfortable with a personal history as the categorization of his life.</span></p> <p><span>For those of us who weren't allowed to stay up until 11:30 on Saturday nights in the early 1980s the Al Franken Decade was a skit on Saturday Night Live. Alan S. Franken '73 declared that the 80s were his decade.</span></p> <p><span>Narcissistic? Certainly not. Not for a Harvard graduate.</span></p> <p><span>In fact, the Al Franken Decade had to be the single greatest attempt to break the tyranny of history and make sure that we don't get our personal significance squashed into the crude oil to be sold in some later millennium for $1.18 a gallon.</span></p> <p><span>In 1990, Franken even started a family dynasty of individual freedom by bringing his three-year-old son into the show and declaring the '90s to be the Joe Franken Decade. In his speech at the Institute of Politics on Wednesday. Franken said he didn't know what the turn of the century would hold. But he knew that it didn't start until the year 2001. I have great hopes for the Al Franken future.</span></p> <p><span><b>H</b>OWEVER, I feel compelled to usurp some of Joe's time. He's still in elementary school, and Franken doesn't have any other kids--so I think I can do this.</span></p> <p><span><i>I hereby declare 1992 until 1995 the Beth Pinsker Couple of Years.</i></span></p> <p><span>I'd take a whole decade, but in this recession, I can only afford a couple of years.</span></p> <p><span>So, sit back and enjoy it folks. My couple of years are going to be characterized by the inattention to detail. In fact, my time may run over a little because I have trouble with the date most of the time. My watch also doesn't have any numbers on it so I can only approximate the time.</span></p> <p><span>For a while, we should be able to forget about the numbers and statistics that numb our society into the submission to greater forces than the present. How many delegates to the Democratic Convention does Bill Clinton have? In my couple of years, who cares? What do the leading economic indicators say this month? I don't know. I couldn't tell you what they meant even if I did and you probably wouldn't want to know anyway.</span></p> <p><span>These statistics only exist so that we can compare them to past data. We're supposed to be able to mark our progress and compare our relative success or failure to other relative success or failure to other relative successes and failures. Where do we fit in? Somewhere between thermonuclear destruction and environmental collapse? But let's not worry about our beginnings or our destruction now.</span></p> <p><span>In the Beth Pinsker Couple of Years, none of that matters.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Lick Me, You Fool ! | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b>N A CURRENT radio ad, a man explains that his wife has figured out how to end the recession: print advertisements on stamps. This would stimulate the advertisement industry, lead to more consumption by the people reading the ads, pave the way for bigger stamps for bigger ads, and thus solve our economic woes. At some point in the radio spot, the man wonders if stamps are not supposed to be symbols of the government and if this idea might be, well, degrading.</span></p> <p><span>That's an interesting thought, the idea that government might be respectable enough that it <i>could</i> be degraded. Unfortunately, commercialized degradation as a symbol of our government is not inappropriate at all. Just ask President Bush.</span></p> <p><span>Bush, of course, has been starring in commercials shown around the world, asking foreigners to buy expensive, lowquality American exports. Once upon a time a president might have thought that debasing himself in front of billions of foreigners was cheap and repugnant.</span></p> <p><span>Can you picture Abraham Lincoln prostituting himself for inefficient industries and bloated management? Would FDR have sullied his hands with such garbage?</span></p> <p><span>These times, apparently, are past. It is worth noting that our President appears in more ads overseas than does Madonna, the former quintessential American commercial whore.</span></p> <p><span>Even Iraq's Saddam Hussein, not normally noted for his esteemed governance, would not lower himself that far. The Iraqi government recently criticized our prostitute of a leader by sarcastically recommending that George Bush stay out of the internal affairs of Iraq and \"concentrate his efforts on succeeding in his new job as a salesman of cars.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>R</b>ECENT YEARS may have illustrated the futility of communism, but they have not disproven the theories of Karl Marx. Marx predicted that in a capitalistic state, government must inevitably be the tool of the bourgeoisie. And that Marx was right is certainly the first thought that comes to mind when one hears that President Bush (or, rather, president, as he can hardly be said to merit a capitalized title) is now a celebrity spokesman for Chrysler.</span></p> <p><span>Three fourths of our bilateral trade deficit with Japan comes from the importation of automobiles, evoking the image of bloated American executives (who make 10 times the salary of their Japanese counterparts and preside over companies about one-tenth as successful) calling on the president to advertise for them when business, as always, is bad--a great deal as long as Bush does not charge.</span></p> <p><span>In fact, Bush could make a lot of money for product endorsements if he wanted to collect. The American film industry isn't above extorting advertisers to put products into films. Remember the Reeses' Pieces in E.T.? That wasn't Eliot's favorite candy--M&amp;M just didn't want to kick into Sam Spielberg's college tuition.</span></p> <p><span>And in this Olympic year, every product is trying to latch on as the official sponsor of international good will, team spirit and lots and lots of money. Ordinary North American supermen--Dan and Dave--have Reebok pumps. Couldn't we all be great athletes like them if we had them too?</span></p> <p><span>It probably wouldn't be out of line for Bush to entice a major industrial sponsor. He tried it with J.C. Penny's earlier this year. He also recently co-opted Arnold Schwarzenegger to campaign for him. If Bush went for Diet Coke or Dow Chemicals next, he might start faring better in the polls. And he would have much more interesting commercials.</span></p> <p><span><b>B</b>UT EVEN more frightening than the presidency prostituting itself for appallingly rich, incompetent business executives is that its doing so does not seem new or surprising to most Americans. The Japanese would no doubt have shot their Prime Minister--or demanded that he commit suicide--if he had disgraced their country so badly.</span></p> <p><span>But we Americans have been fed such a consumerist diet for so long (epitomized by Reagan, but then, even he did not sink this low) that we no longer think it strange that our politicians lack dignity. It is difficult for Americans to step back and remember that the present horror is just that, and not at all a natural or necessary one. And it is almost impossible for us to conceive of politics as actually being <i>noble.</i></span></p> <p><span>But we should try. Philosophers from Aristotle to the present have extolled the good inherent in political life. Genevan Jean-Jacques Rousseau conceived of the public life as the sole basis of virtue in human beings. This is the ideal of which we have lost sight. Instead, for us, political participation is a dirty word.</span></p> <p><span>Hundreds of college students will be employed by political action committees this summer. What do their job application letters say? Certainly not what the students are thinking: \"Dear Sir or Madam: Next to our president, your organization is the single greatest obstruction to the effective functioning of a dignified government. I am repulsed by what you do and appalled by the suggestion that I would work for you.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>G</b>ARRY TRUDEAU brilliantly sums up this depressing state of affairs in the \"Doonesbury\" episode in which a man asks if singers are tired of having their reputations tarnished by suggestions of having affairs with <i>politicians.</i></span></p> <p><span>But there is some hope. When Madonna's <i>Truth or Dare</i> movie came out, following her \"Justify My Love\" scandal, many Americans breathed a sigh of relief. She had done it all. There was just nothing left that could be more shocking or obscene. Perhaps this is our consolation for Bush's shameful appearance on television advertisements.</span></p> <p><span>American government no longer has any dignity left to lose. Before long we will probably have the stamp ads envisioned by the woman on the radio commercial.</span></p> <p><span>So go ahead and lick them--just for the taste of it...sponsored by Diet Coke and the Committee to Re-Elect George Bush.</span></p> <p><span>I'll be sending all my mail UPS.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Money means Nothing in Kaus' Post-Liberal America | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>At the Democratic National Convention a few weeks ago, keynote speakers Bill Bradley, Zell Miller and Barbara Jordan painted vivid pictures of an America gone awry. The socioeconomic gap between white and Black and rich and poor has always been vast, but since 1981 it seems to have widened even more. Politicians who play on Americans'' increasing fears of race and class strife may very well win the election.</span></p> <p><span>True, George Bush has done nothing to soothe tensions, and the exceptional public-opinion poll boost the convention gave to Bill Clinton suggests that Americans might once again embrace \"affirmative government.\"</span></p> <p><span>But what does that mean? According to Mickey Kaus '73, a senior editor of The New Republic and author of <i>The End of Equality,</i>New Deal-Great Society Democrats think that government, if it wants to erase inequality, must pursue large-scale income-redistribution policies. Apparently, these appeals keep a small, hard core of voters from breaking ranks.</span></p> <p><span>As November draws near and Clinton's huge lead inevitably shrinks, the Arkansas governor may promise redistribution in order to hold on to his party's most faithful. And maybe that's not so bad. If you're a Democrat tired of losing all the time, you can conclude that whatever pulls in another million votes it fair game, right?</span></p> <p><span>Well, not really. First of all, class warfare doesn't win elections. The Republican coalition of the wealthy and the suburban middle class outnumbers and out-participates the Democrats' volatile supporters of money equality.</span></p> <p><span>More significantly, if you want to improve the sorry state of fin-de-siecle America, you can't just play around with the income bell curve. Even if tax-and-transfer policies actually effected a substantial reallocation of income (they don't) Kaus doubts that any social benefits would result.</span></p> <p><span>Kaus divides egalitarian sentiment into two major threads. Money egalitarianism seeks primarily to level differences in income. The \"Civic Liberal\" partisans of social egalitarianism, by contrast, don't care who makes how much , as long as people treat each other with respect.</span></p> <p><span>Social and money equality don't travel together. Kaus's data suggest that money equality increased greatly between around 1950 and 1973, and then slipped back slightly after 1973. Yet between 1950 and 1984 social equality nosedived.</span></p> <p><span>Here Kaus invokes the stereotypical picture of a nation united by \"Ozzie and Harriet\" and World War II. By 1984 some amalgam of investment bankers and $1000 watches dominated the American culture scene. In spite of the money inequality of the 1950s, Kaus says (maybe a bit implausibly), Americans were happier then.</span></p> <p><span>The main difference between the 1950s and the 1980s, Kaus concludes, lies in the size of the public sphere. The ever-decreasing frequency of interactions between individuals from different backgrounds has nearly destroyed social equality. More and more, Americans equate salary earned with intrinsic worth, and so a shrinking public sphere allows snobbery and status envy to geed upon income differences.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>The End of Equality</i></b></span></p> <p><span>by Mickey Kaus '73</span></p> <p><span>Basic Books</span></p> <p><span>$25.00</span></p> <p><span>Kaus wants to convince Americans that money doesn't mean anything. As long as everyone has enough to eat, it doesn't matter that some people are rich and others aren't. Indeed, the free market and the work ethic that goes with it require this inventive. He concludes that we can resolve social inequality by reinventing the institutions that used to keep our culture from falling to pieces.</span></p> <p><span>The blurbs on the back cover of <i>The End of Equality t</i>try to paint Kaus' message as a radical departure from American political practice. Author Lawrence Mead goes so far as to name Kaus \"the inventor of Civic Liberalism. \"But despite the book-jacket bluster, Kaus' solution is as old as America itself. Alexis de Tocqueville considered strong civic ties to be the cornerstone of democracy, and the activists of the French Revolution even reorganized the calendar in order to squeeze class rivalry out of late-eighteenth-century society. Kaus' philosophy is nothing new.</span></p> <p><span>But the real innovation of <i>The End of Equality</i> is that it follows time-honored civic liberalism to its logical ends. Kaus maintains that the first problem civic liberals must eliminate is the persistence of underclass. If the United States can somehow raise its poorest citizens' standard of living, other Americans won't be able to justify their flight from the public sphere. The perceived threat that the poorly-educated, crime-ridden underclass poses to the children of the wealthy and the middle class will disappear, and Americans will find their way back into public parks, public schools, public transportation and the like.</span></p> <p><span>How do you rehabilitate the underclass? According to <i>The End of Equality</i>, you give up on welfare and instead guarantee subsistence-level jobs. Sidestepping economic issues entirely, the author mentions only the benefits of increased social equality. Everyone who wants to live will have to work. Without middle-class derision of \"welfare mothers\" and \"welfare cheats,\" the ubiquity of work will bind Americans together.</span></p> <p><span><i>The End of Equality</i> suggests that other institutional changes will shore up the new public sphere. A healthcare system that puts the rich and poor together in the same doctors' offices and hospital rooms demonstrates an unequivocal refusal to value the lives of the rich more than those of the poor. Likewise a military draft. Although it provides and easy out for college-aged males who hesitate to face the risks and rigors of military service, the current All-Volunteer Force is the epitome of institutionalized social inequality; the poor boys get paid to get killed, and everyone else stays home. Earnest institutional changes Kaus implies, can and must rebuild society.</span></p> <p><span>There's no guarantee the Kaus' forced Civic Liberalism will be any more successful than the class-blind Pruit-lgoe apartment complex. Bauhaus architect Mies van der Rohe built this vast concrete block, devoid of the tenements' decaying wood and the bourgeois curves, angles and bay windows. But people resented the ugly, socially-engineered building, and the housing authority that paid for the place ended up dynamiting it.</span></p> <p><span>We might cynically suggest that a desire for social superiority--not just material well-being--motivates people, and Civic Liberalism is therefore doomed to failure. Maybe you just can't convince people that money doesn't matter.</span></p> <p><span>Kaus' plan is no blueprint for the rebuilding of American society. The evidence he accepts is reasonable but not rigorous. too anecdotal, too thin. And like utopians of the past, he pessimistically critiques the old politics while messianically exalting the new.</span></p> <p><span>But his proposals about how society ought to work are no less credible than anyone else's ideas. Clinton's still uneasy mix of money and civic liberalism remains untested, and certainly neither the old-style Democrats nor the Republicans offer better solutions. With no end to American's current malaise in sight, revitalizing common culture can't hurt.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Massachusetts Republicans Come Back | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>HOUSTON--Massachusetts alternate John Harris remembers 1986 all too well. And it's not the Red Sox flop that makes him shudder.</span></p> <p><span>Harris, now a member of the Governor's Council, says he ran for the same post in that year and \"went down with so many other Republican candidates\" in a Dukakis landslide.</span></p> <p><span>\"That was definitely a tough time to be a Republican, but it also served as the birth of a new party in Massachusetts,\" said Harris, an Andover resident. \"We started localizing at the city level, and everybody saw what happened four years later--a revolution.</span></p> <p><span>In 1990, William F. Weld '66 became the state's first Republican governor in 20 years. A large number of seats in the Massachusetts legislature were turned over to the Republican Party. And Harris won his election--the first time in 30 years a Republican has held his post.</span></p> <p><span>Republican politicians and citizens who have journeyed here from Massachusetts, including Harris, say the recent climb in Republican influence in the Commonwealth has rejuvenated their political spirits. Not only do most of them say it's much easier to be a Republican in Massachusetts these days, but they describe it as \"fun.\"</span></p> <p><span>State Sen. Richard Tisei, a delegate from Wakefield who served in the House served in the House from 1984 to 1990 before moving to the Senate, says that the sparse number of Republican elected officials used to make things very tough for him in the legislature.</span></p> <p><span>\"Times were tough when I was elected in 1984. I was the only Republican within [Greater \"Boston],\" said Tisei, who ran Gov. Weld's campaign in 1990.</span></p> <p><span>\"But now, with Governor Weld in office and the turnover in the legislature, it's a good time to be a Republican--the best time in the last 20 years,\" He says.</span></p> <p><span>And the new attitude extends beyond the elected officials and into the Republicans' private lives, according to Kent Lage, an aide to the delegation from Charlestown.</span></p> <p><span>\"It was bit of struggle to be a Republican after the gubernatorial debacle in 1986,\" Lage says. \"But now with Governor Weld in office, we command a great deal more respect.\"</span></p> <p><span>Some delegates also point out that having a Republican lieutenant governor, Paul A. Cellucci, and a Republican state treasurer, Joseph D. Malone '78, only adds to the comfort from having a Republican governor.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with The Crimson, Malone said the state's new Republican leadership is making progress in turning around the problems left behind by Democratic rule in the state, and that only produces more support for the Republicans.</span></p> <p><span>\"In Massachusetts, given the fact that we have great institutions of higher learning, top medical and research centers and a good geographical location, we just needed to give the people the proper incentive to go the extra mile,\" Malone said.</span></p> <p><span>\"And now we're starting to see that,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>While many of the Massachusetts, residents here say that they find it easier to be a Republican in Massachusetts, the feelgood words don't come from across the board.</span></p> <p><span>Marilyn E. Rollins, a delegate from Boston, said she has always found it difficult as a Republican in Boston, especially because she is also a Black woman. Rollins, who supports Weld, said the Republican governor's presence and the recent emergence of Republican representation hasn't improved her situation.</span></p> <p><span>\"With a Republican governor in office, it's still not significantly better for me,\" Rollins said. \"I would like to see more people of color active in the Republican Party, because that might help do away with the racism that still sits in the city.\"</span></p> <p><span>Other delegates said the changes in Massachusetts politics haven't affected them. Mary Rogeness, a delegate from Longmeadow, said her part of the state has traditionally been a Republican one. \"But it's good to see the party prevailing elsewhere too,\" Rogeness said.</span></p> <p><span>Jefferson said she has never found it hard to stand out as a Republican in Massachusetts because she is \"not influenced by what others do or say.\"</span></p> <p><span>The Massachusetts delegates who did say it is now easer to be Republican, attribute much of Weld's success to the increasing number of Republican in the State House. \"Not only do we have a Republican governor, but we also have the senators to sustain the vetoes,\" Tisei said.</span></p> <p><span>State Rep. Augusta Hornblower said she had been \"waiting all along for Governor Weld.\" And she said that now, with the addition of more Republican legislators, the state party can accomplish more of its goals.</span></p> <p><span>\"Now it's piece of cake. Our message has been correct all along: We can turn it around,\" Hornblower said.\" \"One party has been the rule in Massachusetts for so long, but now we have the balance we need for open debate.\"</span></p> <p><span>Hornblower and many others said that if President Bush had the similar balance in the U.S. legislature as Weld has in Massachusetts, a \"cooperative congress,\" he would be able to make more progress--and he would have waltzed through the November election instead of enduring the dogfight with Clinton.</span></p> <p><span>Blaming a Democratic Congress for Bush's problems with domestic matters, Massachusetts Republicans like Jerry Robbins said they think Bush will have a tough time coming back from his deficit in the current polls.</span></p> <p><span>\"I'd like to see us all walk out of here on Thursday with a lot of unity,\" said Robbins, who traveled to the convention from Danvers to help Weld. \"We have good men up there, but the campaign is still lagging. I just hope [James] Baker will help turn it around.\"</span></p> <p><span>The majority of the Massachusetts stronghold here this week want Bush for \"Four more Years,\" and have swept their fears under their hotel beds. Many said they are confident that the convention will send Bush back to the top of the polls and secure his reelection. Margaret Dwyer, an alternate from Wakefield, said she heard a poll on TV Tuesday morning that showed Bush is \"already closing the gap.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"We're going to do it in November,\" Dwyer said \"It looks like the president is going to pull off one of those great Celtics comebacks.\"</span></p>"}

That book and the critiques that followed have focused on the reporters' \"pack mentality\" and the candidates and journalists' inability to focus on the issues.</span></p> <p><span>But for all the critical columns, magazine pieces and books like Crouse's hardly anything ever changes. In fact, this year's political reporting will probably be worse than ever.</span></p> <p><span>Just yesterday, George Bush saw his criticism of Bill Clinton's health plan overshadowed by two meaningless stories. The first was speculation about whether Bush will drop out of the race. The second described the backlash against a Republican press release concerning Bill Clinton's alleged infidelity.</span></p> <p><span>The first was a garbage story: Bush will never drop out of the race and the press knows it. The second may well be a story, but it's not as important as, say, a serious critique of both candidates' plans and records--a story that did <i>not</i> appear in this weekend's papers.</span></p> <p><span>It's not that the candidates don't talk about the issues. Both Bush and Clinton wanted to talk about health care last weekend. It's just that the press is more attracted to the horserace.</span></p> <p><span>But they're just about the only ones really interested in those kinds of stories. The American people, however, don't need to know the answer to the question \"who would win if the election was tomorrow.\" To decide who they'll vote for in November, they need to know about the issues and candidates.</span></p> <p><span>Journalists do these stories: there <i>are</i> features on the candidates' plans, ideas and leadership ability. The problem is that these articles get lost in the course of the year-long campaign. By the time the general election comes around, the stories outlining all the candidates' health plans (written back during the primary season) are forgotten in the barrage of articles about adultery and chocolate chip cookies.</span></p> <p><span>After that initial story about an issue, it becomes old news; editors want to put something \"fresh\" in their paper. So in order to get on the front page, the campaign reporters are forced to churn out \"scandal of the day\" stories.</span></p> <p><span>Real changes in campaign reporting won't evolve until we see real changes in the nature of campaigns. If the campaign only lasted for three months and not three years, the newspapers wouldn't have time to find the day's scandal. Instead they would be forced to report on the issues. And these articles would get more exposure from editors and producers because they'd still be \"fresh.\"</span></p> <p><span>This kind of change would give \"The McLauglin Group\" less to talk about. But it would bring out the real substance of political reporting and better inform the American public.</span></p> <p><span><i>Julian E.

Porter, the president's domestic policy adviser, and others in the White House seem to sense Bush's fear and listlessness. In a get-together with Harvard students earlier this summer, Porter, a former Harvard professor, spent much of his time defending Bush' commitment to domestic policy.

This year, they're not only doing that--they're winning.)</span></p> <p><span>But Bush can't hope to win by pointing out that politics is an odd business, full of changing calculations. That's because most Americans don't fear this change as much as he does.</span></p> <p><span>The desire for change is nearly incomprehensible to the president. At times he seems to think change is just \"another crazy idea\" from the Democrats, as he labeled the Clinton health care plan. \"If the other side gets in power, change is all you'll have left in your pocket,\" he zings Clinton occasionally.</span></p> <p><span>And at the times--usually in the same speech--he casts himself as the true agent of change. \"I stand for a change,\" Bush told the Jacksonville audience, asking them to help him \"change\" Congress by throwing the Democrats out. In another speech, he called himself \"the candidate of change.\"</span></p> <p><span>George Bush for change? It is at these moments that the president spins his most unbelievable rhetoric; and his most politically retarded.</span></p> <p><span>The very idea that an incumbent president would run for reelection by the telling voters that change is necessary strikes an oxymoronic cord. As one old reporter put it, \"In all the politics I've heard tell of...I don't recall a single politician ever having asked for a second term of office in order to make sure that the failed policies of his first would be abandoned in favor of something else.\"</span></p> <p><span>Bush will never win the change vote, which Clinton locked up with some kind, departing words from Ross Perot. More important, it's not clear that the president believes change is necessary. When he speaks of change, he usually means pushing domestic policy farther right. But he has not Shown the political will to do that in the last three and a half years, and he is understandably loath to criticize his own decisions.</span></p> <p><span>Take the case of federal regulation. Conservatives savage the president for presiding over one of the greatest increases in governmental regulation ever during his watch. A Heritage Foundation study last month flayed Bush for allowing the amount of money spent annually on administering regulatory programs to swell from $9.6 billion in 1988 to $11.3 billion today.</span></p> <p><span>The Clean Air Act, the Civil Rights Act and the Americans With Disabilities Act snare most of the blame for this increase. But Bush rightly defends his signing of all three bills. His campaign manager, Frederic V. Malek, told Republicans on the Hill that Bush would run on this record. The response from at least one conservative member of Congress: \"That ain't going to do it.\"</span></p> <p><span>Two weeks ago, the Bush-Quayle campaign dispatched Gov. Carroll A. Campbell of South Carolina to Washington to bash Clinton, but when faced with questions about regulation, he had to fudge. Campbell at first said a Clinton administration would mean regulatory horrors. But then he had to admit that Bush-approved legislation meant huge regulatory increases--and he had to defend Bush's signatures on the bills. It was classic double-speak.</span></p> <p><span>A second case in point: the budget deficit. Bush has called his own acquiescence to the 1990 tax hike \"a mistake\" But Bush and many of his advisers simply don't believe this. Budget director Richard G. Darman '64 strongly backed the compromise, as did Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady. It's true that some administration officials opposed the measure, but Bush himself bragged about it privately. One of his top aides told Japanese officials that the budget deal showed the Bush administration \"knowing how to do the difficult things\" on the deficit.</span></p> <p><span>The point is that talk from Bush today about the need for change is not just politically asinine--it's not credible. Bush is a moderate politician who, like Clinton, believes in compromise to reach moderate solution--on taxes, regulation, civil rights, and in the Gulf War.</span></p> <p><span>His view of politics--that it's \"weird\" and \"strange\"--contrasts sharply with that of his predecessor. Anthony R. Dolan, a former Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and Reagan speechwriter, put that president's philosophy best: \"Ideas are the stuff of politics,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>When ideas form your conceptual framework of politics, you don't view the process as odd--you view it in clear terms of ideological conflict. George Bush ahs rarely been able to do that. His view of politics is precisely what Dolan said Reagan's was not: That it is \"about meetings, conferences, phone calls, rules and decisions\"--the mechanism of compromise and moderation.</span></p> <p><span>Bush uses these tools extremely well, as we saw when he put together the anti-Saddam coalition. But when ideologies swing voters beyond concerns about who can best use these tools, Bush gets uncomfortable. Now he is left pleading with the public to judge which candidate they \"trust\" more with the instruments of governing.</span></p> <p><span>The president, it is becoming increasingly clear, will lose this election. If any case, if Bush hopes to win, he must cast aside his fear and dishonesty about wanting change. And he must speak with strong conviction about what he does believe in and has been practicing--the politics of moderation.</span></p>"}
{"title": "A Test for the UN | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>he bloodshed and suffering in the former Yugoslavia are providing the United Nations with a definitive test that will determine what role the body will play in the emerging post-Cold War word. Time, however, is running out. The world is now witnessing the takeover of an independent nation and the murder and displacement of much of its population. If the U.N. allows this to continue, then by its own inaction, it will have relegated itself to the role of a glorified bystander, unable even to defend the sovereignty of one of its member states.</span></p> <p><span>The U.N. and the world have to this point shown in immoral degree of patience with the Serbian invasion and the \"ethnic cleansing\" effort. As reports of atrocities have seeped out of Bosnia. The U.N. and individual nations have reacted with frustrating sluggishness.</span></p> <p><span>When British Prime Minister John Major heard reports that Serbs were herding Croats and Muslims into sealed box cars destined for concentration camps, he called for an international conference to convene not immediately but at the end of August; Neville Chamberlain would be proud. Similarly, President Bush, when presented with a serious plan for action by the Clinton campaign, mocked it as \"reckless\" through his spokesperson.</span></p> <p><span>The U.N. as a whole has done no better. As Serbia's federal army and Serb irregulars ravage the recently independent states of Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina, both now full members of the U.N. the United Nations Secretary General and Security Council have responded with nothing but meaningless proclamations. The sparse U.N. forces in the war zone have been a laughing-stock, closing down its operations whenever mortar rounds fall too near and suffering the injury of their own soldiers without a peep.</span></p> <p><span>Secretary Boutros Boutros-Ghali complained about the attention the Balkan war was receiving in contrast with the Somalian famine, calling it a \"rich man's war.\" While Boutros-Ghali's rage at the lack of action on Somalia is understandable, his statement is reprehensible. As Secretary General, his job is tolead and marshal support for U.N. efforts, not to diminish one tragedy in the face of another. At a time when inspiring leadership is needed at the U.N., Boutros-Ghali has sunk to the level of ridiculous name-calling.</span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile, Bosnia, which had been a model of ethnic harmony, is being savagely pulled into ethnic zones, with the Serbs controlling the vast majority of Bosnian territory. Media coverage of this tragedy has forced the U.N. to offer at least the appearance of action. Yet even recent moderate moves by the United Nations have been sparked not by its own leadership, but rather by the dramatic trip of French president Francois Mitterand into warn-torn Sarajevo. The French, along with the Germans, seem to be trying to fill the vacuum of outside leadership that has characterized the fighting in Croatia and Bosnia.</span></p> <p><span>The need for a nation-state to take the lead demonstrates the impotence of the current United Nations. This impotence was understandable during the Cold War, with the dominating and polarizing influence of NATO and the Warsaw Pact making only the most tepid action possible.</span></p> <p><span>Today, the U.N is simply acting with cowardice. The fall of the Soviet bloc has freed the United Nations from the restrictions of the Cold War and has offered it the chance to be a major force in shaping the post-Cold War world. So far, the offer has been politely declined.</span></p> <p><span>Though President Bush gloried in the internationalism of the Gulf War, the U.N. was clearly following the lead of the United States when it came to authorizing military action. Even the help the U.N. did gave was extracted painfully through months of bartering, pleading and pressure by President Bush.</span></p> <p><span>The U.N.'s reluctance to act decisively even in the face of Iraq's blatant aggression should have warned the world of its incompetence in handling the current Balkan crisis on its own.</span></p> <p><span>If the United Nations can find the will to repair what damage it can in the Balkans, there may still be hope. This will not be easy and it will require significant force. The Serb artillery in the hills can be silenced by air power, but pushing the Serbs out of tof Bosnia they hold can only be accomplished by ground troops. Strong action by the United Nations will save the people of Bosnia from further horrors while setting a precedent for future united world action.</span></p> <p><span>However, if the United Nations continues its path of indecision and indifference, the message will be clear: The world is not yet ready for a real United Nations. Individual nations, and especially the powerful democracies, have not yet developed the will to lead the world in causes they perceived as not directly in their interest.</span></p> <p><span>Until nations recognize that the peace, security and human rights of all nations, the weak as well as the powerful, are in their individual interests, the Kuwaits will be rescued and the Bosnias will bleed.</span></p>"}

Weld '66 addressed the Republican National Convention Tuesday night, evoking a mixture of cheers of cheers and boos when he restated his opposition to the platform's antiabortion plank.</span></p> <p><span>The governor, who spearheaded an unsuccessful effort Monday to reopen debate on the platform's abortion plank, brought up the issue one more time for everyone to hear. \"I happen to think that individual freedom should extended to a women's right to choose,\" Weld said. \"I want the government out of your pocketbook and your bedroom.\"</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with The Crimson later that night, Weld indicated that neither he nor the pro-choice activists within the party intend to let the pro-choice movement lose any steam. Given this year's rumblings, Weld thinks the party will undergo much change on the abortion issue.</span></p> <p><span>\"In 1996 the Republican Party will be neutral or pro-choice,\" Weld said.</span></p> <p><span>And although the powers that be in the Republican party may not have agreed with Weld, they gave their blessing to the speech.</span></p> <p><span>\"I think Governor Weld made a principled statement,\" Republican National Committee Chair Rich Bond told The Crimson.</span></p> <p><span>Bond said he didn't mind that Weld opposed the Republican platform on abortion. \"What I expect him to agree with us on is George Bush, and that's what's most important to me.\"</span></p> <p><span>Massachusetts State Senator Cecile Hicks, an alternate from the fifth Middlesex district, said Weld dealt with his feeling on abortion tactfully and couldn't have done a batter job with his speech.</span></p> <p><span>\"If the platform is going to change in four years, someone must lead the charge,\" Hicks said, \"and I think Weld did it...in a respectable way.\"</span></p> <p><span>The majority of the Massachusetts delegation, donning Boston Celtics hats with \"Governor Weld\" embroidered on the back, supports Weld on the abortion issue. In a vote earlier this week, 22 of the 38 delegates favored a pro-choice stand, according to State Senator Richard Tisei, a delegate from Wake field.</span></p> <p><span>\"The Massachusetts delegation is a bit ahead of the country with a libertarian brand of Republicanism, with support for gay rights and the right to have an abortion,\" said Tisei.</span></p> <p><span>Tisei also said that many Republicans from across the country feel differently than do the party' leaders, and were looking for Weld to \"set the standard\" at the convention Tuesday night. \"The platform is a lot more conservative than the actual membership,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>Margaret Hare, a lifelong South Carolina resident whose mother is a delegate for that state, said the tide is slowly turning to prochoice among Republicans across the country. And she believes that Weld's speech will only accelerated the process.</span></p> <p><span>\"I am very happy that Gov. Weld said just what I wanted to hear on the abortion issue, she said. \"I didn't hear too many boos from the crowd, which indicates the party is shifting on the issue.\"</span></p> <p><span>Dr. Mildred Jefferson, a delegate from the eight congressional district, which includes Cambridge, is one of the delegates who vehemently opposed Weld for his views on abortion and homosexual rights.</span></p> <p><span>\"I am very unhappy that Gov. Weld has chosen position on abortion and homosexuality that don't stand the test of history on social issues,\" said Jefferson, past-president of the National Right to Life Committee. \"I wanted the first Republican governor in 20 years to achieve a distinguished record, but that can't happen with any policy that expends human lives.\"</span></p> <p><span>Glenn Kelly, a Buchanan delegate from Falmouth, said that Weld's uncompromising persistence on the abortion issue is counterproductive to the Republican's main objective of unifying under President Bush.</span></p> <p><span>\"There was no reason for his back-door approach to reopen the debate for the platform [on Monday], and there's no reason for him to do it again in his speech,\" Kelly said. \"Unity within the party when everyone leaves here on Thursday would be nice--I just hope were capable of doing it.\"</span></p> <p><span>But Hicks, the state senator, said there is no possibility that one issue will prevent the party from rallying behind its candidate come November.</span></p> <p><span>\"We don't have to worry about this disagreement because we unified on so many other issues besides abortion,\" she said.</span></p> <p><span>And in his speech Weld predicated the split on the abortion issue actually may help the Republicans because it demonstrates a diversity lacking in the Democratic Party.</span></p> <p><span>\"Disagreement is not unhealthy. Unlike the Democrats, George Bush and the Republican Party are not afraid of a little disagreement. My appearance before you tonight proves it,\" Weld said.</span></p> <p><span>\"We shouldn't let this issue divide us...because all of us agree that re-electing George Bush is critical to the future of the country,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>Weld's address to the convention also blasted Arkansas Gov. Clinton for his state's lax restrictions that let prisoners out early, and criticized Democrats in general for their fiscal policies.</span></p> <p><span>\"My platform in 1990 was 'tough on taxes, tough on crime.' Ladies and Gentlemen, Republican are both and the Democrats are neither,\" he said. \"The Democrats' taxiing and spending habits remind me of that old definition of a baby: a huge appetite on the end, and no sense of responsibility on the other.\"</span></p> <p><span>He said the Republican ideals he has used in rejuvenating the Massachusetts economy have finally started \"digging ourselves out from the economic damage that the Democrats inflicted on our state.\"</span></p>"}

The Democratic Convention's rovingreporters were rapper MC Lite and rock star DaveMustane of Megadeth.</span></p> <p><span>Not to mention Soren, the permanent reporter onMTV's political beat. She's relatively new to MTV,Corradina says, which gives her a \"nice freshperspective.\"</span></p> <p><span>On Tuesday afternoon, shortly after 1 p.m.,Soren sits in the seats of the Astrodome'sdesignated Radio TV area, high above theconvention floor. Powerful electric fans blow coolair into the shadowy seating section. Cheers fromthe floor session--eerily distant--waft past thesilvery rafters. A few feet ahead, bright lightsfocus on a row of stand-up spaces, where cameracrews from MTV, FNN, Comedy Central and othernetworks prepare to film their reporters.</span></p> <p><span>Soren's attire is a far cry from typicalreporters' garb: she wore black pants, black bootsand a floppy printed blouse with floppy sleevesand rufles. (Her unprofessional appearance got herstopped by a security guard at the Astrodomeentrance; the guard gave her a special once-overwith a hand-held metal detector.)</span></p> <p><span>She sits scribbling in a reporter's notebookand rehearsing her delivery of the copy she hadwritten: Hi, I'm Tabitha Soren MTV News.\"</span></p> <p><span>Two Duke University students with a cameratraverse the passage way behind the seats, timidlyapproach and remind her that they interviewed herat the democratic convention last month. They'vehad an easier time getting around the Astrodome,they say, than they had in Madison Square Garden.</span></p> <p><span>\"It helps to have been to one,\" Soren tellsthem with a smile. \"This is only my second, too.\"</span></p> <p><span>But Soren has the routine down, expertlylifting herself into the elevated director's chairin the tiny workspace, only a few feet square. Herfeet dangle from the ends of the chair. Close by,iterns and production assistants sit cross-leggedamidst coils and wires.</span></p> <p><span>Again and again, Soren recites her now nearlymemorized copy--\"Thanks, Kurt.

{"title": "GOP Counts Its Youthful Support | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>HOUSTON--Peering around the convention floor yesterday morning, John Loza '85 couldn't help but notice the swarm of more than 1500 college students walking the aisles with their spirited shout, \"four more years.\"</span></p> <p><span>Loza, an alternate delegate for Texas and a former vice president of the Republican Club of Harvard, said Republicans can only be encouraged by such a strong convention showing form the National Youth Coalition.</span></p> <p><span>\"It's great to see so many college Republicans making it out here for the convention.\" said Loza, now an assistant district attorney in Dallas. \"When I was at Harvard, I never saw so many college-age Republicans assembled at one time. During my time, the Republican Club never surpassed 80 or 90 members.\"</span></p> <p><span>While many might think that college students are more liberal than the general population, Loza was quick to point out that the youth vote is anything but a weakness for the Republicans--at least if the last two elections are any indication.</span></p> <p><span>The GOP candidate won the nation's \"youth vote,\" voters between the age of 18 and 24, in 1984 and again in 1988. And if you ask anyone here why Reagan and Bush have been able to win that youth vote, you get a number of different answers.</span></p> <p><span>Caroline Boyd, a senior at American University, said there are simply more Republican youths than Democrats.</span></p> <p><span>\"The young liberals happen to be much more outspoken, so it seems like there are more of them,\" she said \"But the fact is that there is a conservative majority among youths.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>Organization is Key</b></span></p> <p><span>Regardless of which party can boast more loyal young people, the key to a strong showing among the 18-24 age group is organization, said Phil Meuret, the president of the College Republicans at Texas A&amp;M University.</span></p> <p><span>\"The Republicans understand that the future of the country is in the youth, so they make sure that the National Youth Coalition keeps the youth unified,\" Meuret said. \"The Democrats don't have a comparable organization at the youth level.\"</span></p> <p><span>Loza and Meuret both emphasized the importance of getting the youth to vote Republican in their first and second elections because it is unlikely that they will change allegiances in the future.</span></p> <p><span>\"Just as with any habit made early in life when someone votes one way the first, and second time, it's a lot more likely that they will vote that way down the road. If it doesn't set at lifelong pattern of definite votes for Republicans, at least it sets a lifelong leaning to that side.\"</span></p> <p><span>If the Republicans do in fact win the \"youth vote\" for the third straight election, the implications for future elections would favor the Republican party--regardless of the outcome in 1992.</span></p> <p><span>Meuret said that 12 straight years of votes would likely support the Republicans candidates for the rest of their lives, which would make it difficult for he Democrats to win in years to come.</span></p> <p><span>\"Things will be much easier for the Republicans as time goes on,\" he said.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Return of the `The Wimp Factor' | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>W</b>hat some called \"the wimp factor\" and others labelled \"the vision thing\" is haunting George Bush again. And the GOP platform rhetoric of commitment to \"family values\" isn't a powerful enough incantation to exorcise it.</span></p> <p><span>Not only is the platform flawed, but Bush himself is unable to demonstrate a firm resolve to uphold the principles his campaign claims to be about. His proposed platform focuses on the wrong issues, ones which are not of central concern to most voters, and expresses positions on these issues that are more extreme than those held by many Americans.</span></p> <p><span>In addition, conservatives are a more diverse group than the GOP imagines. Those who favor libertarian or classical liberal philosophies over Moral Majority ideology will see through the posturing about family values and realize that the Bush-Quayle administration's record is less than ideal on quite a few conservative issues.</span></p> <p><span>To begin with, the main problem on voters' minds right now is the economy. We could care less about how Bush would treat a gay grandchild. If abortion has become a deciding factor for those wavering between voting Democrat or Republican, it is because the Bush administration has mounted a forceful attack on abortion rights. Even many Republican voters see this as a betrayal of principles Bush once held, as well as of the conservative principle of protecting individual rights against government intrusion. The GOP's emphasis on simplistic and harsh answers to questions of sexual values gives the impression that they think the country would be all right in no time if we just tightened our belts and zippered our files.</span></p> <p><span>The hard-line Republican position on these issues betrays that Bush's campaign is based on out-of-touch poses rather than a practical agenda. Leadership of a nation means more than pandering to a small group of extremists, and certainly more than assuming that the people will go anywhere if you lead them assertively enough.</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>hile he's not as bad as the press has painted him in the past, Bush needs to learn that assertiveness isn't enough without follow through, i.e. his actions need to be consistent with his openly stated principles. His behavior in Rio was a rare example of good leadership, unfortunately not given its due by the press.</span></p> <p><span>Though he claims to \"know in his heart, like Barry Goldwater,\" that he's right about government denying women the right to choose, Bush inexplicably also told the press that he would support that right if his own granddaughter had an unwanted pregnancy. Quayle recently responded the same way to press questioning. It's hard to hide the fact that a blatant double standard is operating here, coupled with a hypocrisy that the two politicians are not even smart enough to hide. This is hardly admirable leadership.</span></p> <p><span>As for foreign policy, the Gulf war, Bush's alleged triumph, accomplished far less than was claimed: Saddam's still there and still making us look like fools. And I for one would have respected Bush more if he had admitted that we <i>were</i> in it for our own \"selfish\" national interests like oil. His pretense that our motives were altruistic has now caused the world to look to us for help in areas like Bosnia and Somalia where we have no strategic interest and cannot afford to be bogged down. The idea that government should function as protector of its own country's interests and not as global crusader is another conservative principle of limited government that (except in Rio) Bush has largely ignored.</span></p> <p><span>There are other reasons why Bush's support among conservatives may not be as strong as he hopes. (And for a campaign that \"preaches to the converted\" instead of wooing the center, this is a major problem.) On several key issues, Bush has acted like (gasp!) a <i>liberal.</i></span></p> <p><span>The Republican Party is supposed to be against taxes and big government. Yet in 1990 Bush greatly increased taxes in order to reduce the deficit, a move which not only increased the deficit but was a form of governmental tinkering with the economy usually practiced by what Bush calls \"tax-and-spend liberals.\" Plus it made Mr. Read-my-lips look mighty stupid.</span></p> <p><span>Bush also betrayed the principle of treating people as individuals and not as groups when he consented to the Civil Rights Act. And despite his defense of business against regulations at Rio, he sent an opposite message by passing the Clean Air Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. The final absurdity is the GOP platform's endorsement of laws allowing victims of sexual violence to sue pornographers. What's next--a photo of Barbara Bush hugging Andrea Dworkin? Activist government: it's not just for liberals any more.</span></p> <p><span>It's clear that the GOP's platform and candidates are not exactly a recipe for success. If they lose the White House in November, though, it is important to note that America is rejecting not conservatism but an administration that embodies the narrowest of right-wing principles without the vision or courage even to defend those adequately. We've read your lips, George, and it's pretty clear that Ann Richards was right when she said you were born with a silver foot in your mouth.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Political Sands Shifting As Faculty Council Nears Decision on ROTC Status | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>It would be anticlimactic, to say the least.</span></p> <p><span>After years of vehement protests and angry demonstrations, after months of discussion and delays, the issue of ROTC on campus could be determined by the American public, not the Faculty Council.</span></p> <p><span>When voters choose a president, they will likely also choose a prepackaged policy regarding the military's ban on gays--the focal point of the ROTC debate.</span></p> <p><span>Democrat contender Gov. Bill Clinton has decried the ban as a violation of homosexuals' civil rights. He promises to reverse the policy if elected.</span></p> <p><span>\"Bill Clinton will issue executive orders to repeal the ban on gays and lesbians from military or foreign service,\" read the opening lines of a Clinton policy sheet on issues of concern to gays and lesbians.</span></p> <p><span>The Republican platform, on the other hand, upholds the ban: \"We support the continued exclusion of homosexuals from the military as a matter of good order and discipline.\"</span></p> <p><span>The GOP plank violates Harvard's policy of nondiscrimination. And ROTC opponents say this is reason enough to keep the program off campus.</span></p> <p><span>The ROTC debate did not always center on the military's treatment of gays and lesbians. In fact, when vehement protesters helped to force the organization off campus in the late 1960s, they were concerned with Harvard's ties to the military-industrial complex.</span></p> <p><span>Professor of Law Daniel J. Meltzer '72, who was a Harvard undergraduate during the first ROTC debates, says students and professors also worried about academic questions raised by the program. They debated whether ROTC instructors should receive faculty status, and whether ROTC courses should count for Harvard credit.</span></p> <p><span>In the wake of these debates, the Faculty in 1969 eliminated the Harvard program altogether. In 1976, it revamped its policy to form Harvard's current relationship with ROTC, whereby cadets enroll in the ROTC program at MIT.</span></p> <p><span>The faculty committee is now considering whether to recommend severing all ties with ROTC, a step well beyond removing the program from campus.</span></p> <p><span>But in the current controversy, general suspicion and dislike of the military has all but disappeared as an issue.</span></p> <p><span>Few people at Harvard bear any grudge against the Department of Defense per se, says Meltzer, who sits on the student-faculty committee on ROTC. Otherwise, the University might be obliged to reconsider the hundreds of thousands of dollars in Department of Defense grants and fellowships it receives each year.</span></p> <p><span>And many supporters of the status quo interviewed by the committee have cited economics to bolster their argument: that eliminating ROTC scholarships would prevent some financially strapped students from attending Harvard at all.</span></p> <p><span>\"The consensus on the committee is that we would like to present the option for Harvard students to...participate in ROTC\" if the program complies with the nondiscrimination policy, Meltzer says.</span></p> <p><span>Since Harvard's dispute with ROTC comes down to the ban on gays, Clinton's election--and an elimination of the ban--would seem to settle the controversy. It may even open the gates for the program's physical return to campus.</span></p> <p><span>Dean of the College L. Fred Jewett '57 says he thinks ROTC will remain off campus regardless of the presidential election, due to lack of space and lack of widespread interest.</span></p> <p><span>\"My own guess would be that the military would be unlikely to Balkanize and have chapters at all the schools,\" Jewett says.</span></p> <p><span>Cuts in military spending may also make ROTC less likely to open another chapter, Jewett says.</span></p> <p><span>Still, the ban's elimination might pave a new path for the program, and would certainly eliminate most opposition to it.</span></p> <p><span>A presidential election is difficult to predict. Rather than wait, ROTC committee members say they will press forward with a recommendation to the Faculty.</span></p> <p><span>That recommendation--and the Faculty's decision--is already months late. In 1990, the Faculty Council set an ultimatum: if the ban was not removed by May 1992, Harvard would sever all ties. Period.</span></p> <p><span>But when Dean of the Faculty Jeremy R. Knowles assumed office last year, he declared the ultimatum invalid and appointed a committee to study the issue.</span></p> <p><span>Committee members hoped to present a report at the end of last year, but appealed for more time in the spring.</span></p> <p><span>Pforzheimer University Professor Sidney Verba '53, who chairs the committee, says he hopes to present a recommendation well before the election.</span></p> <p><span>\"We really are aiming for the beginning of the fall,\" he says, estimating that a report will be completed in late September or early October.</span></p> <p><span>\"If we think we have a set of recommendations that makes sense, there's no reason to wait on those,\" Meltzer says, especially since the Democrats are not certain to adhere to a campaign pledge.</span></p> <p><span>Committee members are drifting back into town, and Verba says he will soon call a meeting. The Harvard faculty, it seems, is eager to have its say in the issue. Ultimately, though, that say may be less than significant.</span></p> <p><span><i>Joe Mathews contributed to the reporting of this article.</i></span></p>"}

Dutch Elm disease is wreaking havoc on the University's arboreal population.</span></p> <p><span>In June, a tree in front of Holworthy and a tree in the Yard's center--both about 80 years old--met their untimely demise. In the past 10 years, 10 to 12 trees across the University have succumbed to the disease. About 40 percent of Harvard's elms are reportedly infected.</span></p> <p><span>Now, University officials are researching ways to replenish Harvard's tree supply, investigating disease resistant tree species with elm-esque tall trunks and full canopies.</span></p> <p><span>As part of the Yard's refoliaging, the University may have a chance to increase its much-touted diversity. A greater range of species, officials say, reduces the risk of destructive tree epidemics.</span></p> <p><span><b>411 PAGES, $115 BILLION</b></span></p> <p><span>On July 23, President Bush signed into law an act expanding federal student aid programs and allowing Harvard to once again cooperate with other universities in allocating financial aid dollars.</span></p> <p><span>Ivy league presidents praised the act, saying it will help them insure that financial aid dollars are equitably distributed.</span></p> <p><span>The 411 page, $115 billion law also will make Harvard report to the government about large donations from foreign sources. It may force changes in the College's sexual assault policy. <i>[See related story, page B-6.]</i></span></p> <p><span>The Higher Education Reauthorization Act expanded federally guaranteed student loan programs. Elizabeth M. Hicks, assistant dean of admissions and financial aid for federal and special programs, said students from all parts of Harvard University already borrow about $40 million a year under the programs, and she said the new law may increase that by as much as $10 million.</span></p> <p><span><b>MARITIME MESSIAH</b></span></p> <p><span>The Tall Ships came to Boston this July amidst hype and fanfare. And one Russian tall ship sailed away with a bit of Michael Berry magic on board.</span></p> <p><span>The Mealtime Messiah, along with many other New England residents, responded to a plea from hungry sailors on the undersupplied tall ship Sedov. The Sedov, participating in this summer's Sail Boston festivities, found both its money and its food supply had run dangerously low as the ship arrived in Beantown.</span></p> <p><span>Attending a cocktail party on the Sedov, Harvard Dining Services Director Berry heard about the ship's woes and agreed to provide the sailors with much-needed provisions.</span></p> <p><span>It took about six hours for dining services workers to amass items from Harvard's food suppliers. The Sedov set sail for England stocked with hundreds of pounds of chicken legs, peeled tomatoes, ketchup and cabbage.</span></p> <p><span>The Sedov sailors, most of them teenagers, also embarked on their journey with a full supply of Harvard hats.</span></p> <p><span><b>GRO 1, WHALES 0</b></span></p> <p><span>At last June's Commencement exercises, Norway Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland--fresh from the Earth Summit in Rio de Janiero, Brazil--delivered an idealistic keynote speech about the importance of the environment.</span></p> <p><span>Less than a month later, the acclaimed environmentalist was under fire from wildlife defense groups who criticized her decision to resume Norway's commercial whale hunt.</span></p> <p><span>Brundtland, who gave the keynote address at the Rio conference, based her decision on scientific evidence she said showed that certain whale populations are no longer endangered.</span></p> <p><span>But representatives of Greenpeace and other organizations said the scientific evidence may be full of blow holes. In addition, they said, Norway's economy does not rely on the whale trade, and whale meat only appeals to a very small market of affluent Japanese.</span></p> <p><span><b>BANG THE DRUM SOFTLY</b></span></p> <p><span>Street musicians and Square residents clashed before the City Council this summer over an act that critics claim will effectively ban drum playing in Cambridge.</span></p> <p><span>In August, the council passed the act, which restricts the allowable noise from public performances to 80 decibels from a distance of 25 feet--half the distance previously required. From 150 feet, street musicians' dulcet tones must must now be inaudible.</span></p> <p><span>Square residents called drumming \"a worm on the brain\" and complained about its effects on mental health. But street musicians complained of cultural elitism, bias and censorship, and warned that when percussion is suppressed, the Square's eclectic atmosphere will dampen.</span></p> <p><span><b>MOVING UP IN THE WORLD</b></span></p> <p><span>The library's Government Documents and Microforms Division--currently housed in dark, cramped Lamont subbasement--may move to the first floor of Lamont.</span></p> <p><span>Larsen Librarian of Harvard College Richard De Gennaro commissioned architectural plans for a revamped Gov Docs workspace, which would fill Lamont's seldom-used first floor reading room. The project would cost between $400,000 and $500,000, and would come from building reserves and other funds.</span></p> <p><span>The Faculty of Arts and Sciences library committee must approve the changes this fall before any construction can begin.</span></p> <p><span><b>THE BELL TOLLS</b></span></p> <p><span>Derrick A. Bell is Weld professor of law no longer.</span></p> <p><span>The former law professor captured public attention two years ago when he announced that he would take an unpaid leave of absence until the Law School offered tenure to a woman of color.</span></p> <p><span>In July, Rudenstine dismissed Bell from his position for exceeding the two-year limit on unpaid leave. In an unprecedented hearing, Bell appealed to a special committee of Harvard's governing boards. But in August, the Corporation denied his request to extend his leave of absence.</span></p> <p><span>Bell will remain a visiting professor at New York University Law School.</span></p> <p><span><b>FAMILY VALUES</b></span></p> <p><span>As the nation plunged into a rowdy debate about \"family values,\" Cambridge began its own efforts to address the issue this summer.</span></p> <p><span>At several hearings throughout the summer the City Council debated the merits of a proposed \"domestic partnership\" law which would extend rights to some unmarried couples.</span></p> <p><span>Councillor Alice K. Wolf introduced the ordinance, which would allow unrelated couples--both heterosexual and homosexual--to gain a \"domestic partnership\" license from city hall for the cost of a marriage license.</span></p> <p><span>With the license, non-biological parents could access the school records of a domestic partner's children, and domestic partners could obtain visiting rights at Cambridge hospitals and health care benefits for domestic partners.</span></p> <p><span>Several councillors said they would oppose the law because it does not allow siblings and other couples to register as domestic partners.</span></p> <p><span>But some on the council's progressive majority accused the dissenters of trying to torpedo the entire ordinance.</span></p> <p><span>The council will vote on the bill in September.</span></p> <p><span><b>WINDFALL</b></span></p> <p><span>The largest donation ever from an individual--$3 million--wouldn't ordinarily cause many complaints from Harvard Law School alumni or faculty.</span></p> <p><span>But some say they are worried that Reginald F. Lewis's donation may send the wrong message to an administration that has been lax in promoting faculty ethnic diversity.</span></p> <p><span>Lewis, a New York lawyer, heads the largest Black-owned corporation in the country, TLC Beatrice Holdings. The international law center to be renamed for him will be the first building at Harvard to be named for an African-American.</span></p> <p><span>But Law School critics, including former Weld Professor of Law Derrick A. Bell, say they worry that Law School Dean Robert C. Clark may get the wrong idea from the gift. A sizable gift from a Black donor might foster a sense of complacency among administrators, causing them to recruit minority professors less vigorously, according to Bell and others.</span></p> <p><span><b>HOLE IN THE THEORY</b></span></p> <p><span>Those hoping for McDonald's in the Square shouldn't hold their breath; stringent area regulations won't even let a Dunkin' Donuts franchise slip through the cracks.</span></p> <p><span>The Board of Zoning Appeals voted to prohibit owners from opening a doughnut shop at the former site of TCBY. City law requires fast food businesses to receive special permits before opening shop in the Square.</span></p> <p><span>The Harvard Square Defense Fund, a citizens' action group, argued at several heated hearings that they wanted to keep the Square distinct from \"Everywhere, America.\" They said ice cream shops and doughnut shops are different from other fast food establishments.</span></p> <p><span>Doughnut advocates blasted Defense Fund members' fear of fast food, insisting that the Square needs reasonably-priced food.</span></p>"}

{"title": "What I Did Over Summer Vacation | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>S</b>everal years ago, the District of Columbia was deciding on a new motto to put on its license plates, and one of the ideas suggested was \"Washington, D.C.: don't Believe the Hype.\" After dutifully fulfilling my obligation as a government concentrator to spend at least one summer within several miles of the White House and wear a power tie every day to work, I would sooner do all of the reading for my classes this fall than live in that would-be state.</span></p> <p><span>It's not that Washington isn't a good place to visit or to do an internship. The Institute of Politics would never lie to you, would it? How could D.C. remain the Gov jock Mecca for every University in the country if it didn't deliver? As thousands of Harvard students will tell you, a job there can be awesome. For one thing, the entire city is run by people under age 30, so professionals who actually have important things to do can be duped into taking you seriously--even though your job is only picking up your boss's dry cleaning.</span></p> <p><span>\"I work at the Cato Institute\" can mean you wine-and-dine ambassadors daily, or you fill out name tags for $3.65 and hour. This is especially effective because most people don't know that the Cato Institute is just some house in your average neighborhood that holds \"forums\" by crowding lots of people into the living room.</span></p> <p><span>For my job, I interviewed a number of career civil servants (and let me digress to say that if you have a lot of talent and ambition and want to victimize yourself in an occupation with inadequate pay--but have rejected elementary school teaching because it has some slight shred of respect--then the civil service is for you), and these people, many of whom actually run entire agencies, <i>took me seriously.</i> Truly gifted interns for whom truth is no handicap will find that worthwhile political connections are only a few business cards away.</span></p> <p><span><b>B</b>ut the City of a Thousand Points of Light has an inescapable problem. The flight from Harvard \"Diversity-Is-Us\" University to Washington is like moving to South Africa. And this is the part the Office of Career Services doesn't tell you about. The poverty stricken city of Washington is overwhelmingly Black, and all those well-dressed and powerful professionals running our country--the people you see on television and read about in the paper--are white. They don't live in D.C., of course. They live in neighboring Arlington, Va., Bethesda, Md. and the infinite well-to-do entirely white suburbs only a Metro ride away.</span></p> <p><span>It's not like this is anything striking in a city. New York and Los Angeles are like that as well. Subways bring in the suburban whites who fill up the downtown office buildings, and then take them back as they flee the city with the sunset.</span></p> <p><span>But this is <i>Washington,</i> D.C., and it's supposed to be different. Isn't that why Congress banned the slave trade in the District long before the Civil War--to make the country look good? But the race/geography/income line is so sharp and clear that naive (but increasingly cynical) liberals such as myself can't stand it.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>ND WHAT IS WORST is not that the situation exists--as I said, it's hardly surprising--but that of anywhere it should and <i>could</i> be different in the District.</span></p> <p><span>Washington has very limited local autonomy, and the amount of control Congress has over it is both amazing and highly undemocratic. So what does Congress do with this power? does it use D.C. as a test area for innovative education reform? Does it use its unique financial and political power to renovate the city, to keep up the infrastructure? To practice badly needed health care reform in a small experimental area as a prelude to national action?</span></p> <p><span>No. Congress spends its time overruling local ordinances allowing same-sex couples legal rights. It haggles over the city's appropriations, not because it has a better idea for Washington, but simply because it <i>can,</i> no matter illogical it is for a senator from Utah to be telling D.C. how to run its local affairs.</span></p> <p><span>Congress is constantly blamed in this election season for neglecting the problems of the inner cities in New York and Los Angeles--as well as the concerns of small town America and our nation's farms. But Washington, D.C. is under the direct control of Congress. And if anyone has the right to complain it's the people who live there. Congress' neglect of the problems that are under their jurisdiction shows the real political neglect practiced these days by our leaders.</span></p> <p><span>Those without enough votes to oust a representative--and remember D.C. has no voting member in Congress--have little control over their future. The residents of our capital have to rely on the generosity of voters in other states who probably don't even realize that they are deciding the fate of Washington, D.C. when they choose their representatives.</span></p> <p><span>This summer the Democratic Convention gave us some pretty powerful speeches on the need for racial equality. We heard Jimmy Carter plead for attention to human rights. And Bill Clinton endorsed Washington's bid for statehood. But in spite of some finely orchestrated platitudes, the party of Congress has done remarkably little for an area over which it has so much control. Members of Congress and their staff have been shot near their offices, and ambassadors robbed near their embassies, but you haven't heard--and you won't hear--anyone advocating some help for this poor, murder-a-night city.</span></p> <p><span><b>G</b>OING TO D.C. is billed as practical education for government concentrators. And this is certainly true--especially if you want to learn about the responsibility government has to complete all of its tasks, not just those which are politically expedient.</span></p> <p><span>So next summer get a job in Washington. It's a learning experience.</span></p> <p><span><i>Thomas S. Hixson '94 spent the summer interning at Government Executive magazine in, of course, Washington, D.C.</i></span></p>"}

{"title": "Political Sands Shifting As Faculty Council Nears Decision on ROTC Status | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>It would be anticlimactic, to say the least.</span></p> <p><span>After years of vehement protests and angry demonstrations, after months of discussion and delays, the issue of ROTC on campus could be determined by the American public, not the Faculty Council.</span></p> <p><span>When voters choose a president, they will likely also choose a prepackaged policy regarding the military's ban on gays--the focal point of the ROTC debate.</span></p> <p><span>Democrat contender Gov. Bill Clinton has decried the ban as a violation of homosexuals' civil rights. He promises to reverse the policy if elected.</span></p> <p><span>\"Bill Clinton will issue executive orders to repeal the ban on gays and lesbians from military or foreign service,\" read the opening lines of a Clinton policy sheet on issues of concern to gays and lesbians.</span></p> <p><span>The Republican platform, on the other hand, upholds the ban: \"We support the continued exclusion of homosexuals from the military as a matter of good order and discipline.\"</span></p> <p><span>The GOP plank violates Harvard's policy of nondiscrimination. And ROTC opponents say this is reason enough to keep the program off campus.</span></p> <p><span>The ROTC debate did not always center on the military's treatment of gays and lesbians. In fact, when vehement protesters helped to force the organization off campus in the late 1960s, they were concerned with Harvard's ties to the military industrial complex.</span></p> <p><span>Professor of Law Daniel J. Meltzer '72, who was a Harvard undergraduate during the first ROTC debates, says students and professors also worried about academic questions raised by the program. They debated whether ROTC instructors should receive faculty status, and whether ROTC courses should count for Harvard credit.</span></p> <p><span>In the wake of these debates, the Faculty in 1969 eliminated the Harvard program altogether. In 1976, it revamped its policy to form Harvard's current relationship with ROTC, whereby cadets enroll in the ROTC program at MIT.</span></p> <p><span>The faculty committee is now considering whether to recommend severing all ties with ROTC, a step well beyond removing the program from campus.</span></p> <p><span>But in the current controversy, general suspicion and dislike of the military has all but disappeared as an issue.</span></p> <p><span>Few people at Harvard bear any grudge against the Department of Defense per se, says Meltzer, who sits on the student-faculty committee on ROTC. Otherwise, the University might be obliged to reconsider the hundreds of thousands of dollars in Department of Defense grants and fellowships it receives each year.</span></p> <p><span>And many supporters of the status quo interviewed by the committee have cited economics to bolster their argument: that eliminating ROTC scholarships would prevent some financially strapped students from attending Harvard at all.</span></p> <p><span>\"The consensus on the committee is that we would like to present the option for Harvard students to...participate in ROTC\" if the program complies with the nondiscrimination policy, Meltzer says.</span></p> <p><span>Since Harvard's dispute with ROTC comes down to the ban on gays, Clinton's election--and an elimination of the ban--would seem to settle the controversy. It may even open the gates for the program's physical return to campus.</span></p> <p><span>Dean of the College L. Fred Jewett '57 says he thinks ROTC will remain off campus regardless of the presidential election, due to lack of space and lack of widespread interest.</span></p> <p><span>\"My own guess would be that the military would be unlikely to Balkanize and have chapters at all the schools,\" Jewett says.</span></p> <p><span>Cuts in military spending may also make ROTC less likely to open another chapter, Jewett says.</span></p> <p><span>Still, the ban's elimination might pave a new path for the program, and would certainly eliminate most opposition to it.</span></p> <p><span>A presidential election is difficult to predict. Rather than wait, ROTC committee members say they will press forward with a recommendation to the Faculty.</span></p> <p><span>That recommendation--and the Faculty's decision--is already months late. In 1990, the Faculty Council set an ultimatum: if the ban was not removed by May 1992, Harvard would sever all ties. Period.</span></p> <p><span>But when Dean of the Faculty Jeremy R. Knowles assumed office last year, he declared the ultimatum invalid and appointed a committee to study the issue.</span></p> <p><span>Committee members hoped to present a report at the end of last year, but appealed for more time in the spring.</span></p> <p><span>Pforzheimer University Professor Sidney Verba '53, who chairs the committee, says he hopes to present a recommendation well before the election.</span></p> <p><span>\"We really are aiming for the beginning of the fall,\" he says, estimating that a report will be completed in late September or early October.</span></p> <p><span>\"If we think we have a set of recommendations that makes sense, there's no reason to wait on those,\" Meltzer says, especially since the Democrats are not certain to adhere to a campaign pledge.</span></p> <p><span>Committee members are drifting back into town, and Verba says he will soon call a meeting. The Harvard faculty, it seems, is eager to have its say in the issue. Ultimately, though, that say may be less than significant.</span></p> <p><span><i>Joe Mathews contributed to the reporting of this article.</i></span></p>"}

He promises to reverse the policy if elected.</span></p> <p><span>\"Bill Clinton will issue executive orders to repeal the ban on gays and lesbians from military or foreign service,\" read the opening lines of a Clinton policy sheet on issues of concern to gays and lesbians.</span></p> <p><span>The Republican platform, on the other hand, upholds the ban: \"We support the continued exclusion of homosexuals from the military as a matter of good order and discipline.\"</span></p> <p><span>The GOP plank violates Harvard's policy of nondiscrimination. And ROTC opponents say this is reason enough to keep the program off campus.</span></p> <p><span>The ROTC debate did not always center on the military's treatment of gays and lesbians. In fact, when vehement protesters helped to force the organization off campus in the late 1960s, they were concerned with Harvard's ties to the military industrial complex.</span></p> <p><span>Professor of Law Daniel J. Meltzer '72, who was a Harvard undergraduate during the first ROTC debates, says students and professors also worried about academic questions raised by the program. They debated whether ROTC instructors should receive faculty status, and whether ROTC courses should count for Harvard credit.</span></p> <p><span>In the wake of these debates, the Faculty in 1969 eliminated the Harvard program altogether. In 1976, it revamped its policy to form Harvard's current relationship with ROTC, whereby cadets enroll in the ROTC program at MIT.</span></p> <p><span>The faculty committee is now considering whether to recommend severing all ties with ROTC, a step well beyond removing the program from campus.</span></p> <p><span>But in the current controversy, general suspicion and dislike of the military has all but disappeared as an issue.</span></p> <p><span>Few people at Harvard bear any grudge against the Department of Defense per se, says Meltzer, who sits on the student-faculty committee on ROTC. Otherwise, the University might be obliged to reconsider the hundreds of thousands of dollars in Department of Defense grants and fellowships it receives each year.</span></p> <p><span>And many supporters of the status quo interviewed by the committee have cited economics to bolster their argument: that eliminating ROTC scholarships would prevent some financially strapped students from attending Harvard at all.</span></p> <p><span>\"The consensus on the committee is that we would like to present the option for Harvard students to...participate in ROTC\" if the program complies with the nondiscrimination policy, Meltzer says.</span></p> <p><span>Since Harvard's dispute with ROTC comes down to the ban on gays, Clinton's election--and an elimination of the ban--would seem to settle the controversy. It may even open the gates for the program's physical return to campus.</span></p> <p><span>Dean of the College L. Fred Jewett '57 says he thinks ROTC will remain off campus regardless of the presidential election, due to lack of space and lack of widespread interest.</span></p> <p><span>\"My own guess would be that the military would be unlikely to Balkanize and have chapters at all the schools,\" Jewett says.</span></p> <p><span>Cuts in military spending may also make ROTC less likely to open another chapter, Jewett says.</span></p> <p><span>Still, the ban's elimination might pave a new path for the program, and would certainly eliminate most opposition to it.</span></p> <p><span>A presidential election is difficult to predict. Rather than wait, ROTC committee members say they will press forward with a recommendation to the Faculty.</span></p> <p><span>That recommendation--and the Faculty's decision--is already months late. In 1990, the Faculty Council set an ultimatum: if the ban was not removed by May 1992, Harvard would sever all ties. Period.</span></p> <p><span>But when Dean of the Faculty Jeremy R. Knowles assumed office last year, he declared the ultimatum invalid and appointed a committee to study the issue.</span></p> <p><span>Committee members hoped to present a report at the end of last year, but appealed for more time in the spring.</span></p> <p><span>Pforzheimer University Professor Sidney Verba '53, who chairs the committee, says he hopes to present a recommendation well before the election.</span></p> <p><span>\"We really are aiming for the beginning of the fall,\" he says, estimating that a report will be completed in late September or early October.</span></p> <p><span>\"If we think we have a set of recommendations that makes sense, there's no reason to wait on those,\" Meltzer says, especially since the Democrats are not certain to adhere to a campaign pledge.</span></p> <p><span>Committee members are drifting back into town, and Verba says he will soon call a meeting. The Harvard faculty, it seems, is eager to have its say in the issue. Ultimately, though, that say may be less than significant.</span></p> <p><span><i>Joe Mathews contributed to the reporting of this article.</i></span></p>"}

And one Russian tall ship sailed away with a bit of Michael Berry magic on board.</span></p> <p><span>The Mealtime Messiah, along with many other New England residents, responded to a plea from hungry sailors on the undersupplied tall ship Sedov. The Sedov, participating in this summer's Sail Boston festivities, found both its money and its food supply had run dangerously low as the ship arrived in Beantown.</span></p> <p><span>Attending a cocktail party on the Sedov, Harvard Dining Services Director Berry heard about the ship's woes and agreed to provide the sailors with much-needed provisions.</span></p> <p><span>It took about six hours for dining services workers to amass items from Harvard's food suppliers.

From 150 feet, street musicians' dulcet tones must must now be inaudible.</span></p> <p><span>Square residents called drumming \"a worm on the brain\" and complained about its effects on mental health.

Wolf introduced the ordinance, which would allow unrelated couples--both heterosexual and homosexual--to gain a \"domestic partnership\" license from city hall for the cost of a marriage license.</span></p> <p><span>With the license, non-biological parents could access the school records of a domestic partner's children, and domestic partners could obtain visiting rights at Cambridge hospitals and health care benefits for domestic partners.</span></p> <p><span>Several councillors said they would oppose the law because it does not allow siblings and other couples to register as domestic partners.</span></p> <p><span>But some on the council's progressive majority accused the dissenters of trying to torpedo the entire ordinance.</span></p> <p><span>The Council will vote on the bill in September.</span></p> <p><span><b>WINDFALL</b></span></p> <p><span>The largest donation ever from an individual--$3 million--wouldn't ordinarily cause many complaints from Harvard Law School alumni or faculty.</span></p> <p><span>But some say they are worried that Reginald F.

The international law center to be renamed for him will be the first building at Harvard to be named for a Black person.</span></p> <p><span>But Law School critics, including former Weld Professor of Law Derrick A. Bell, say they worry that Law School Dean Robert C. Clark may get the wrong idea from the gift. A sizable gift from a Black donor might foster a sense of complacency among administrators, causing them to recruit minority professors less vigorously, according to Bell and others.</span></p> <p><span><b>HOLE IN THE THEORY</b></span></p> <p><span>Those hoping for McDonald's in the Square shouldn't hold their breath; stringent area regulations won't even let a Dunkin' Donuts franchise slip through the cracks.</span></p> <p><span>The Board of Zoning Appeals voted to prohibit owners from opening a doughnut shop at the former site of TCBY. City law requires fast food businesses to receive special permits before opening shop in the Square.</span></p> <p><span>The Harvard Square Defense Fund, a citizens' action group, argued at several heated hearings that they wanted to keep the Square distinct from \"Everywhere, America.\" They said ice cream shops and doughnut shops are different from other fast food establishments.</span></p> <p><span>Doughnut advocates blasted Defense Fund members' fear of fast food, insisting that the Square needs reasonably-priced food.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Vote for Joe Kennedy | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b>F YOU ARE a registered voter in the Eighth Congressional District in Massachusetts, you could vote for a Kennedy in tomorrow's Democratic Congressional primary. Joseph P. Kennedy, who has help the office for six years, is being challenged by Charles C. Yancey, the Boston City Councillor.</span></p> <p><span>But, Yancey would argue, name recognition is no good reason to cast your vote. And running against a Kennedy in this region, he would know. At the very start of the Eighth District's congressional campaign, Kennedy was, in Yancey's words, \"anointed\" by the local media, and Yancey hasn't got a word in edgewise since. Television and newspapers have not even bothered to cover debates between Yancey and the incumbent.</span></p> <p><span><b>Y</b>ET DESPITE Kennedy's unfair advantage, his six-year record in support of poor and working-class citizens is nearly unmatched in the House. He has displayed dogged support for bills which create social programs benefitting not only his constituents, but also the nation. Massachusetts cannot afford to lose a representative with as much clout and conscience as Kennedy.</span></p> <p><span>His accomplishments read like a wish list for a liberal-minded city like Cambridge. Kennedy has made affordable housing one of his key priorities, and has passed legislation which appropriates $300 million to new housing programs--the largest new allocation in a decade. He has also kept developers from converting low-cost housing units into condominiums.</span></p> <p><span>The Black Congressional Caucus gave Kennedy a 100 percent approval rating, endorsing every vote he made as a representative. Kennedy has also fought to force banks to disclose their loan approvals in their communities to prevent \"redlining\" practices which discriminate against minorities.</span></p> <p><span>Yancey, who is Black, has a nine-year record as Boston City Councillor and has shown a similar drive for social reform and economic development. His efforts led to the reopening in 1984 of Boston fire and police stations closed by Proposition 2 1/2, and he wrote legislation which called for the city of Boston to divest from South Africa.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>N A NUMBER OF CASES, Kennedy has faltered, showing that his predilection for social programs has often led him to neglect the bigger picture of the economy. For instance, Kennedy voted in favor of the proposed balanced budget amendment this summer, joining the crowd which tried to free itself from the realities of fixing the economy by offering their constituents an empty answer to real economic fears. Yancey opposes the amendment. Still, as head of the Clinton-Gore Massachusetts campaign, Kennedy supports the candidates' mandate for deep economic change and investment in the infrastructure.</span></p> <p><span>Also, Kennedy has supported the death penalty in Congress. We cannot agree with this position, and are disappointed that a man with such progressive views clings to this archaic policy. But like our endorsement of Bill Clinton, another politician in favor of the death penalty, we have weighed this position with Kennedy's other positions, and find him an asset to the state.</span></p> <p><span>Clearly, Joe Kennedy has some problems.

Yancey, despite his efforts on the local level, has not effected change anywhere near the scope Kennedy has done.</span></p> <p><span>But the media should have given Yancey more of a chance; their neglect of the candidate was wrong. That television and newspapers chose to \"anoint\" a man for his incumbency and family name is a danger to the democratic process. We hope that in the next campaigns, the media, ourselves included, will give people like Yancey a fair chance.</span></p> <p><span>Despite his deficiencies and unfair advantage, Kennedy remains a leader in social change. And his work and experience in Congress outweigh the advances Yancey has made in Boston.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>N THIS YEAR of anti-incumbent fervor, Massachusetts must be careful not to lose one of its best legislators.

Dutch Elm disease is wreaking havoc on the University's arboreal population.</span></p> <p><span>In June, a tree in front of Holworthy and a tree in the Yard's center--both about 80 years old--met their untimely demise. In the past 10 years, 10 to 12 trees across the University have succumbed to the disease.

And one Russian tall ship sailed away with a bit of Michael Berry magic on board.</span></p> <p><span>The Mealtime Messiah, along with many other New England residents, responded to a plea from hungry sailors on the undersupplied tall ship Sedov. The Sedov, participating in this summer's Sail Boston festivities, found both its money and its food supply had run dangerously low as the ship arrived in Beantown.</span></p> <p><span>Attending a cocktail party on the Sedov, Harvard Dining Services Director Berry heard about the ship's woes and agreed to provide the sailors with much-needed provisions.</span></p> <p><span>It took about six hours for dining services workers to amass items from Harvard's food suppliers.

From 150 feet, street musicians' dulcet tones must must now be inaudible.</span></p> <p><span>Square residents called drumming \"a worm on the brain\" and complained about its effects on mental health.

{"title": "The Killing Fields | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>A</b> war is being waged in a remote corner of this country. It's going on not far from such urban centers as Seattle and Olympia, Portland and Salem. The trees are not falling, they are being felled.</span></p> <p><span>By the year 2000, the campaign to clear the Pacific Northwest of its majestic, virgin forest could be history. And in their race against restrictions and regulations, the timber companies wreak havoc on the countryside.</span></p> <p><span>Hellbent to harvest a crop they did not plant, the loggers leave behind a battlefield strewn with war's spoils: misshapen logs and stumps, distorted and twisted beyond belief--the grotesque deformities of wooden corpses.</span></p> <p><span>Fields like this lie in Forks, a small Washington logging town outside of Olympic National Park that is the westernmost incorporated city in the contiguous U.S. People in Forks boast that they reside in the timber capital of the world and any visitor can get the message loud and clear without even talking to the locals.</span></p> <p><span>As is true in much of the Pacific Northwest, almost every storefront in Forks displays a sign that reads \"We Support the Timber Industry.\" But another sign tells a bit more about the tie that binds together this community of 3000. \"Tie a Yellow Ribbon for the Working Man,\" the placard reads. And sure enough, the small spruce trees that line the road into town are laced with hundreds of yellow ribbons.</span></p> <p><span>No, this is not a display of solidarity with U.S. soldiers who served in the Gulf War, but a show of support for heroes of a different sort--the loggers, troops of the Pacific Northwest--without whom towns like Forks wouldn't exist and wives and children wouldn't be fed. And these days, it's the loggers who are threatening to wipe out a lot more than trees and forest.</span></p> <p><span>Ever since 1989, it became clear that the northern spotted owl was endangered and that much of its natural habitat would be destroyed if unrestricted logging practices continued in Washington and Oregon.</span></p> <p><span>The reclusive owl is fast approaching extinction in places like Forks. Without the tall trees and well-shaded environment of the oldgrowth forest, the owl loses areas needed for nesting, canopy needed for cover and rotting longs needed to support its prey--mice and other rodents--on the forest floor. To put it plainly: no old trees, no spotted owl.</span></p> <p><span>Yet where these trunks lie twisted in treeless meadows and spotted owls venture no more, the poor bird draws more attention and gets more press than the most popular county sheriff. According to Sallie Tisdale, writing in the Sierra Club's July/August 1992 issue of Sierra magazine, \"Spotted owls have been shot, crucified, hung and their corpses mailed to various people perceived as environmentalists.\"</span></p> <p><span>And Forks is not the only logging town where yellow ribbons and timber go hand in hand. All over the Northwest there have been Yellow Ribbon rallies, where, Tisdale reports, \"300, 600, sometimes 1200 log trucks in a line rumble through small towns and along the main thoroughfares of cities for an afternoon.\"</span></p> <p><span>Just bringing up the logging issue with locals unleashes an attack on environmentalists and owls alike. Bob Bray, 46, a gas station attendant who lives in Forks, says if it wasn't for the logging industry there would be no community. \"People outside Forks use the owl as an excuse to limit logging.\" Bray told me this past summer. \"If it wasn't the owl it would be something else.\"</span></p> <p><span>Michelle Morgan, 22, a part-time worker who stands beside Bray, agrees. \"Now I hear they're trying to make a moth or slug an endangered species,\" she says. \"How can that be? How can a moth be an endangered species?\"</span></p> <p><span>Looking me in the eyes and saying that people from cities just can't understand, Bray says, \"Hard to wipe your ass with the spotted owl, huh Michelle?\"</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>rguing with nature's foes isn't that easy. Timber industry executives are no dummies. They try to outsmart their opponents by claiming they're better for the environment than the environmentalists. Tisdale quotes a pamphlet issued by the Caterpillar company--manufacturer of bulldozers and cranes needed to remove the Northwest's oldest trees--as an example of this absurd attempt to fool those opposed to the clearcutting: \"The Facts Say: Forests do not necessarily improve with age. Decaying stands lack the food resources animals require. Density of old stands blocks sunlight, discouraging new growth.\"</span></p> <p><span>Wow! Cutting down forests will help the animals. Save nature by destroying it. Tisdale calls this \"revisionist biology\" and it's dangerous stuff--totally contrary to fact.</span></p> <p><span>Animals need old growth forests for shelter and protection. They need the ground cover that has been there for decades, able to nurture the small plants and animals that support the fragile ecosystem. Animals need a continuous stand of older growth, as survival among smaller trees with limited forage is unsustainable.</span></p> <p><span>And it's not just owls that will suffer from the clearcuts. Removing trees that have been there for centuries causes tremendous erosion. Disappearance of vast root systems allows soil to run down into valleys and rivers, killing fish and destroying the water's web of life. And certainly man is affected by the clearcutting too.</span></p> <p><span>No vacation-seeker would want to spend time in the barren, broken swaths of logged countryside. The loggers have turned many beautiful areas of the Pacific Northwest into ugly, bare brown-spots--almost totally devoid of life.</span></p> <p><span>But the timber industry will go to incredible lengths to mask their true destructive intentions. For the strip of Highway 101 that runs through Forks, the Society of American Foresters actually publishes a brochure to guide you through a \"motor tour\" of the cut-down forests you pass along the way.</span></p> <p><span>This bit of PR couldn't fool the most naive city-dweller. The pamphlet's first sentence reads, \"It is not readily apparent to U.S. Highway 101 travelers that the logged areas all along the route are giving birth to a new generation of forests.\" No kidding. But it only gets better--\"Although the recently logged areas will be unattractive for a time, new trees are growing rapidly.\" Well, not exactly. I could drive down that road every day for the rest of my life and it would still look like Mt. St. Helens had erupted in the next field over.</span></p> <p><span>But in the end, the whole issue comes down to politics and economics. In a quest to woo voters from the rural Northwest, conservative politicians portray the issue as jobs versus the environment, security versus the owl. The move is on to water down the Endangered Species Act in order to allow the timber industry to retain current employment levels and log the spotted owl into extinction.</span></p> <p><span>As reported in The New York Times on Tuesday, some of the small lumber mills in Forks have been forced to close. The town's treasurer and clerk said, \"There's a lot of timber here, but it can't be harvested because of government regulation,\" under the Endangered Species Act.</span></p> <p><span>\"Save jobs, shoot an environmentalist\"--grafitti scrawled inside a bathroom at an Oregon campground--thus came as no surprise.</span></p> <p><span>And comments from a campground worker at a national park in Oregon were not that out of the ordinary either. Suddenly jumping to the environmental issue after a discussion about forest fires, he said, \"It's those environmentalists. I heard one of them on a talk show and they finally got it out of him. They don't want to cut down trees because they don't want to build houses. They don't want anymore growth in this country. That's our whole problem.\"</span></p> <p><span>President Bush, quick to focus on such popular resentment while campaigning in the Pacific Northwest, has found it easy to scapegoat the owl for the region's economic woes. Speaking in Colville, Washington on Monday, Bush said \"Not far from here is a timber town called Forks. Like Colville, Forks supported a mill, and the mill supported a community. Because of a lack of timber, the mill had to close. Today unemployment at Forks is at 20 percent,\" Bush said. \"It's time to put people ahead of owls,\" he concluded.</span></p> <p><span>So the spotted owl and some of the last untouched wilderness in this country will be destroyed to satisfy the insecurities of the man-in-the-white-house in Washington, D.C. and the man-on-the-street in Forks, Washington. Sure. Cut everything down and unemployment will come in a few years anyway--no trees gives loggers nothing to cut down.</span></p> <p><span>The issue isn't as simple as conservatives would have you believe. There's no need for a stark choice between the 3000 residents of Forks and the 3000 northern spotted owl nesting pairs left in Washington, Oregon and California.</span></p> <p><span>What do environmentalists suggest? They're no \"radicals\" or \"extremists,\" as their opponents insist. Says one ranger in Olympic National Park: \"You still need some wood, but some of us support more selective cutting.\"</span></p> <p><span>The trees are already gone and those left standing can't fend off the saws. Others must act in their stead.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Right for the Wrong Reasons | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>he staff is correct in arguing that it's time for Harvard's clerical and technical workers to receive a pay raise.</span></p> <p><span>Age-old business practices dictate that successful institutions increase their employees' salaries every few years. In large measure, these hikes are designed to keep compensation at pace with inflation, though they also serve to build confidence and moral among an organization's employees.</span></p> <p><span>\"Traditionally, it has been usual to get a certain percentage increase [in pay] in each contract period,\" says Patricia Greenfield, a labor relations scholar at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst. \"[It is based on] the concept that workers are entitled by virtue of their continuing work with an organization to an increasing standard of living and that...as they continually commit to the organization, the organization has to continually commit to them.\"</span></p> <p><span>Four percent is a reasonable figure, slightly above the rate of inflation, neither outlandishly high nor ridiculously low. And it is a figure that, as the staff rightly points out, the University can afford with relatively little financial discomfort.</span></p> <p><span>Where the staff errs is in groping for complicated reasons to justify a salary hike. By ignoring the obvious--that every competent employee deserves a pay raise once in a while--and drawning this message amid a sea of questionable economic arguments, the staff position is severely weakened.</span></p> <p><span>First, a simple, across-the-board pay raise such as that being requested by the union should in no way be viewed as a \"reward\" for \"perpetuating excellence,\" as the staff implies. Such terminology should be reserved for seasonal bonuses or merit raises, items not currently under discussion.</span></p> <p><span>Second, Harvard's alleged financial irresponsibility is not an issue here. As the staff points out, \"However much Harvard has spent or wasted in the past, the deans must of course still find the money to pay for this new expenditure.\"</span></p> <p><span>Along these lines, however, the staff's suggestion that Harvard might find the money by encouraging alumni to contribute \"not to flashy projects but to basic, day-to-day budgets and student services\" is wildly idealistic. Does the staff really expect any wealthy alum to donate $1 million to an endowment for clerical salaries?</span></p> <p><span>Third, the staff's assertion that \"investing in people is a good way to achieve higher productivity\" is, at best, debatable. It is based on the argument made by Adam Smith (and, more recently, Gov. Bill Clinton) that \"the wages of labor are the encouragement of industry, which, like every other human quality, improves in proportion to the encouragement it receives.\"</span></p> <p><span>Legendary economist though he was, Smith offered no evidence for this particular hypothesis, nor does the staff. In fact, the father of capitalist theory wrote, \"Some workmen, indeed, when they can earn in four days what will maintain them through the week, will be idle the other three.\"</span></p> <p><span>Fourth, the argument that Harvard's investment in higher wages constitutes an investment in the community and provides for \"healthy, fulfilling lives for Cambridge's workers\" is both questionable and irrelevant. If union workers are, as the staff suggests, \"worried about the next meal,\" then a four percent increase in their income is not likely to boost consumer spending significantly.</span></p> <p><span>In addition, the last point raises questions about Harvard's responsibility to the community beyond its ivied walls--something administration officials readily acknowledge but must weigh against the University's continued financial security. Insensitive as it may sound, Harvard's central mission is research and education, after all, and not community welfare.</span></p> <p><span>Finally, the national differential in wages based on gender is another important, albeit irrelevant point raised by the staff. Certainly it is true that far more women than men are employed as clerical and technical workers at the University. The staff suggests, however, that since women earn less than men nationally, Harvard's female employees need to earn more--as if this will somehow help make up the difference.</span></p> <p><span>Such reasoning is both convoluted and inapplicable to the situation. The more important point is how the wages of Harvard's employees compare with those of clerical and technical workers elsewhere. And, as the staff indicates, \"union members already make slightly more per hour than their counterparts in other area institutions.\"</span></p> <p><span>Nevertheless, the staff's central thesis is indisputable. Clearly, the time is right for Harvard's clerical and technical workers to receive a raise. Not as a reward, or an infusion of cash into the community, or because Harvard occasionally wastes a lot of money in bad investments. Simply because it is reasonable, affordable, and the right thing to do.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Misreading History, Again | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>he \"lesson of Vietnam\" is many things to many people. To the military, the lesson is never to commit forces without being committed to winning. In the Bush administration, this interpretation has been refined into the \"doctrine of invincible force.\"</span></p> <p><span>This theory basically says that unless the U.S. and its allies can amass a force that can completely--and quickly--annihilate the enemy, then no force should be used. In other words, U.S. military policy seems to be boxed in by only two options for every crisis: over-whelming force or none at all.</span></p> <p><span>This all-or-nothing strategy of military action has encouraged the United States to undertake easy battles in Grenada and Panama and to fight a more challenging (and still mostly successful) war in the Persian Gulf.</span></p> <p><span>Yet the invincible force concept is seriously flawed. Less visible than the victories--but just as crucial in terms of measuring the success of U.S. foreign policy--are several ongoing failures resulting from the Bush administration's devotion to the idea.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>n Yugoslavia, for example, President Bush, Pentagon officials and other military experts have been openly skeptical about what military force can achieve. They often cite fear of being drawn into a \"quagmire\" as reasons for avoiding the use of force. Secretary of Defense Richard B. Cheney expresses this view with particular vigor. It is apparent that because the situation in Yugoslavia seems so messy--because the prospects of a speedy solution seem uncertain--the president has determined that no action is the right action. But he is wrong.</span></p> <p><span>Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has outlined several military steps that will help turn back Serbian aggression in Bosnia.</span></p> <p><span>The first is to send arms to the Bosnian forces. Next, she advocates the bombing of Serb heavy artillery and the supply lines running from Serbia to proxy forces in Bosnia.</span></p> <p><span>These actions, while lacking the glamour of Desert Storm, will help accomplish what Bush labeled as the main principle of Desert Storm and the centerpiece of the New World Order: the turning back of aggression.</span></p> <p><span>Similarly, the desperate situation in Somalia, where 4.5 million people are at risk of starvation, could be greatly eased if some moderate military steps were taken.</span></p> <p><span>The major cause of famine in Somalia is not the lack of food, but rather the problems with food distribution. Roving gangs often intercept food before it can reach the areas where it is needed immediately. A convoy of several thousand armed troops, similar to what U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali is proposing, would ensure that food is delivered quickly and efficiently.</span></p> <p><span>Yet the United States, the lone superpower and supposedly the leader of the \"new world,\" has been absent in supplying the initiative and resources to mount such an operation. The U.S. aversion to limited military commitments is again hampering a sensible and moral foreign policy.</span></p> <p><span>The only place the United States is currently leading a small-scale military operation is in Iraq, where the U.S., Britain and France have established a \"no-fly zone\" to protect Shiite rebels in the south.</span></p> <p><span>Sadly but characteristically, this move is an overdue, insufficient and purely political one.</span></p> <p><span>The Shiites have been persecuted relentlessly since the end of the Gulf War, most violently right after the cease-fire.</span></p> <p><span>Yet it was only in August, little more than two months before the election, that Bush's acutely timed sense of outrage appeared. And anyway, the belated operation will make little real difference for the Shiites. Much of the Iraqi persecution is being carried out by ground troops, and still there are no plans to stop Iraq's army.</span></p> <p><span><b>B</b>ush, his surrogates and many pundits talked a lot at the end of the Persian Gulf War about how its success had exorcised the demons of Vietnam. In reality, though, U.S. military policy has only taken a first step. We have overcome our total reluctance to using force. But like a baby learning to walk, our government still clings to the doctrine of invincible force as a security blanket against another fall.</span></p> <p><span>As the desperate situations in Somalia and Bosnia demonstrate, we should grow up in a hurry.</span></p> <p><span><i>David L.

Attempts to look seriously at his record have been obscured by Murphy Brown, Doonesbury and a barrage of potato jokes. He's Ronald Reagan without the power; light relief for us drones in the newsroom.</span></p> <p><span>But as difficult as all this may be for the Vice President to handle personally, surely an adviser or two has pointed out the side benefits of being thought a perpetual lightweight--minimal press scrutiny or public awareness of what he really does. This is particularly true with regard to one of the most significant of Quayle's activities off the golf course, the President's Council on Competiveness, which he heads. Danny Boy has a record, and it's a scary one.</span></p> <p><span>As chair of the Council, Quayle has managed to cater to big business by knocking the guts out of some of the most significant regulatory acts passed into law during Bush's presidency. Not bound by the Freedom of Information Act, Quayle and his cohorts operate in almost complete obscurity. Many people don't even know that the Council exists.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>his is how it works. Say the President signs a regulatory bill--the Clean Air Act, for example--in full media spotlight. Say some business people don't like it. Say they complain to the Council. The staff of the Council will review it and may in turn recommend certain changes in the legislation to the agency that is responsible for implementing it.</span></p> <p><span>It may be even more convenient for business leaders to complain directly to the Vice-President during one of his numerous political junkets. Quayle raised $22 million for Republican campaigns in more than 400 appearances in 1991 alone. The Washington Post reported in January of this year that \"in almost every city he visits as a campaigner, Quayle holds closed-door round tables with business people who have made sizable contributions to the local or the national GOP.\"</span></p> <p><span>Nor does the Council limit their reviews to specific complaints from businesses. In a March 1991 memo, Quayle directed every federal department and agency head to send the Council all \"documents announcing or implementing regulatory policy that affects the public,\" including strategy statements, policy manuals, grant and loan procedures and press releases.</span></p> <p><span>After government agencies receive letters from Quayle and the Council with \"suggested\" changes, they may find it difficult to say no to a group that includes the Vice-President, the Chief of Staff, the Attorney General, the Secretaries of the Treasury and Commerce, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisors. End of story.</span></p> <p><span><b>O</b>ne of the clear targets of the Council has been the Clean Air Act. President Bush signed the bill in 1990, calling it \"the centerpiece of our environmental agenda\" and \"simply the most significant air pollution legislation in our nation's history.\" By the summer of 1991, Quayle's Council had proposed more than 100 changes to it. Among the Council's \"suggestions\":</span></p> <p><span>.Dropping the proposed ban on the incineration of lead batteries, the source of over half of the lead in U.S. garbage. While incinerated lead helps cause high levels of lead in the blood of 400,000 babies each year, Quayle's council reported that the ban \"did not meet the benefit/cost requirements for regulatory policy\" without stating on what data they were basing that assertion.</span></p> <p><span>.Narrowing the definition of what constitutes a wetland, thus allowing private development on as much as 30 million acres of formerly protected wetlands.</span></p> <p><span>.Allowing companies to set their own maximum pollution levels unless the state agency objected within seven days. If no response from the state is forthcoming (if, for example, it took a while for the letter merely to reach the appropriate desk) the emissions permit would automatically be changed to the companies' levels.</span></p> <p><span>.Dropping a regulation to require cities that incinerate their waste to recycle 25 percent of their garbage, a regulation that the EPA predicted \"would pass any imaginable [cost/benefit] test.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>nd unlike Bush, who put his personal assets in a blind trust upon being elected Vice-President, Dan Quayle has never seemed bothered by even the appearance of gross impropriety.</span></p> <p><span>How's this for a benefit/cost analysis of the recycling bill? Quayle owns $350,000 of stock in family controlled Central Newspapers, a conglomerate that owns seven newspapers, two paper mills and a plant devoted to producing virgin newsprint and that reportedly belongs to the same industry organizations that lobbied against the EPA proposal.</span></p> <p><span>None of this has gone completely unnoticed by the Washington community. Both Democratic Sen. John Glenn of Ohio and Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Ca.) have attempted to call Quayle and the Council on some of their more egregious actions. Every few months, another newspaper will write a feature about the Council. The facts about Quayle are out there; they just can't compete with his potato-head image.</span></p> <p><span><i>Lori E.

{"title": "Bag the Gag Rule | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>O</b>n October 1, after much legal wrangling, the abortion \"gag rule\" will go into effect in the nation's 4000 federally funded family planning clinics.</span></p> <p><span>A truly bad piece of public policy, the gag rule will bar most staff members at such clinics from even discussing the option of abortion with pregnant women seeking counseling. And it provides yet another reason to vote against President Bush this November.</span></p> <p><span><b>F</b>irst promulgated by the Reagan administration in 1988, the gag rule was a not-so-disguised way for members of the religious right and other anti-abortion activists to inject their narrow views into government policies otherwise protected by <i>Roe v. Wade.</i> If family planning clinics can't even discuss abortion, gag rule proponents reason, fewer women will have abortions.</span></p> <p><span>For those who support choice, as we do, the issue is simple. Everyone should have as much information as possible about how to handle an unwanted pregnancy in order to make the best choice for their lives. The government should be involved only in protecting that choice.</span></p> <p><span>But even those who oppose abortion rights might find reason to oppose the gag rule.</span></p> <p><span>Most abortion rights opponents basically want the government to prohibit doctors from performing abortions. From our point of view, that's bad enough.</span></p> <p><span>But this rule, in the extreme, would prohibit women from even thinking about abortion--from even knowing that safe, legal abortion exists as an option. In the worst fascist traditions, the rule effects government policy by in some way controlling the thoughts of the governed.</span></p> <p><span>In this context, it is of no small significance that family planning clinics serve mostly poorly educated women living in poverty. It's quite conceivable that might well try to perform abortions themselves without these facts.</span></p> <p><span>For those low-income women forced to complete their pregnancies, their children will have the fewest opportunities to advance. Conservatives who pay little or no attention to the plight of the inner cities should think twice before effectively increasing their populations.</span></p> <p><span>The issue of freedom of speech should also be a concern. While the Bush administration amended the rule last March to allow physicians to discuss abortion with clinic patients, nurses, nurse practitioners and social workers are still forbidden from broaching the option. Any time the government attempts to curtail free speech, warning signals should flash everywhere.</span></p> <p><span>And anyway, about 90 percent of clinic patients see a nurse, not a doctor, when they go for counseling. The move to exempt doctors was simply a cynical ploy to disguise the absurdity of the gag rule.</span></p> <p><span><b>U</b>nfortunately, the efforts of family planning groups to stymie the gag rule's implementation have almost been exhausted. Halted until now by litigation and congressional action, it seems inevitable that the rule will go into effect.</span></p> <p><span>Last year the Supreme Court gave constitutional blessing to the rule, and President Bush vetoed legislation to overturn it. The House and Senate have recently approved a new bill to throw out the rule, if only to force Bush to veto it again during an election year. It's unlikely that Congress will be able to muster enough votes for an override.</span></p> <p><span>What's revealing about the politics of the gag rule is the extent to which the small religious right has come to influence the highest levels of government. Before joining Ronald Reagan on the 1980 ticket, Bush favored abortion rights.</span></p> <p><span>Since then, Reagan and Bush appointees to the high court have protected the rule, and a politically beholden Bush has vowed to support the far right's position on every abortion measure--even to the length of spitting on the Constitution.</span></p> <p><span>One conclusion from all this should be clear: Bush's position on abortion is wrong. In November, we can do something about that. But that shouldn't be the end.</span></p> <p><span>The Supreme Court came perilously close to overturning <i>Roe</i> last summer, and many of the nation's other federal judges oppose abortion rights. In the long term, we should work to pass pro-abortion rights legislation in the states. While we should not ignore legal fights, this battle should also be fought at the grass roots. Winning on this level will mean a more secure future for the right to choose.</span></p>"}
{"title": "The Debate Debate | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>o understand the controversy over the presidential debates this election year, one need only return to one of the debates held in 1988. More than a few observers are convinced that this is where George Bush won his campaign against Michael S. Dukakis.</span></p> <p><span>Already wounded by \"Willie Horton\" and other so-called family value issues, Dukakis found himself mortally wounded by a question from Cable News Network anchor Bernard Shaw.</span></p> <p><span>\"Governor,\" Shaw asked, \"if Kitty Dukakis was raped and murdered, would you change your opposition to capital punishment?\"</span></p> <p><span>Dukakis' cold, white-paper answer, to many, confirmed the Republican charge that he was too out of step with the electorate for the presidency.</span></p> <p><span>Not only did many Republicans think Dukakis finished himself with that answer, but more than a few Democrats thought so as well. Bernard Shaw has told me often that, for months following the debate, a number of Democratic activists were livid with him, and that some accused him of being a Republican ringer in the debate.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>n truth, it wasn't Shaw's question that did Dukakis in. The question, in many ways, was a softball. The coup de grace was Dukakis' cold fish response.</span></p> <p><span>Having been softened up by weeks of negative GOP advertising on everything from the Pledge of Allegiance to crime, Dukakis was overly ripe for the surgical question that would expose a weakness on one of those fronts.</span></p> <p><span>Bush-Quayle campaign officials, led by Chief of Staff James A. Baker III, are in the process of tenderizing Gov. Bill Clinton over the draft and tax-and-spend issues. The plan, it seems, is to muck him up so much that some reporter--rather than a more professorial, single moderator--will cut him to the quick, either with some alleged new information or stylistically, as was done with Dukakis.</span></p> <p><span>Baker et al can be certain that some reporter would do this because of long and close experience with the Washington press corps. Many reporters operate differently before, say, a background briefing by some senior official than they do at high-profile, live news events. For example, the behavior of reporters at a live White House press conference--especially the prime time, East room king--is exponentially different from their behavior at the daily, off-camera White House briefings.</span></p> <p><span>Part of the reason for this is that more than a few reporters have won lucrative network news jobs on the basis of questions asked at such events. So the well-timed and properly phrased question can be worth literally hundreds of thousands of dollars. On such events, careers have been launched.</span></p> <p><span>Another reason is that, on live TV, in front of God and everybody, reporters, like most people, want to be seen as good at their work. So, often, they overreach.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>ll of which leads us to the question of press participation in the electoral process. By the time the presidential campaign gets to the fall debates between the two major parties, reporters have outlived their usefulness, it seems to me. What voters want and are entitled to know is where the two candidates stand and how they stack up against each other. In this, reporters only get in the way.</span></p> <p><span>That is why the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates has it exactly right in recommending that debates be held with a single moderator. Having failed thus far to close the gap on Clinton, the president may decide that it's in his own best interest to debate Clinton--even without reporters.</span></p> <p><span>Nonetheless, major news organizations can go a long way toward repairing their sorry election coverage reputations by forbidding their reporters from participation in the debates.</span></p> <p><span>The American people might actually learn something this time.</span></p> <p><span><i>Kenneth R.

{"title": "Position on Demand | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>\"<b>O</b>ne man with courage makes a majority,\" Andrew Jackson used to say. And while he said it to justify his own autocratic tendencies, it's still a sentiment George Bush and Bill Clinton should take to heart. If they don't, an election whose candidates so often criticize special interest politics will be driven in many ways by those very special interest concerns.</span></p> <p><span>On most issues, both Bush and Clinton are unquestionably moderates within their own parties. Bush often tries to hide his moderation to appease his party's conservatives, while Clinton shows off his moderate views to symbolize his party's \"revitalization.\" Indeed, excluding such anomalies as Sens. Barry M. Goldwater and George S. McGovern, the most radical positions are, in most years, thankfully not represented by either party.</span></p> <p><span>Yet this year, the candidates have adopted extreme positions on abortion, positions that differ greatly from ones they have supported in the past. In fact, they have selected among the most radical positions from a wide spectrum of options.</span></p> <p><span>Why do Bush and Clinton, two very middle-of-the road candidates, sound like hard-line party ideologues on the issue of abortion? The unfortunate answer is that neither has the political courage to be a real moderate. Rather than being a measure of the strength of their convictions, the candidates' positions are a measure of their weakness. Both men are political chameleons on abortion who have simply taken what they see as the politically expedient position--to the detriment of meaningful debate.</span></p> <p><span>The fact that Bush and Clinton feel obliged to take these positions demonstrates the awesome power of special interest groups in politics today. Abortion activists in both parties have bullied their candidates into taking stands that make real progress on the abortion debate nearly impossible.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>he official position of the Bush campaign is that Bush opposes abortion \"except when the life of the mother is threatened or when rape or incest is involved.\" While not quite as inflexible as the Republican platform position, Bush has unmistakably placed himself on the right-wing of the abortion debate.</span></p> <p><span>Bush also committed himself to the pro-life movement in a New York speech last month to a Catholic organization in which he said he would support the prolife position \"no matter what the political cost.\" Yet there are many indications that Bush personally disagrees with what he now spouts publicly.</span></p> <p><span>During his failed 1980 presidential campaign, Bush said unequivocally that he supported a woman's right to an abortion. When he joined the Reagan team, he took on the campaign's position, and he has been a more or less ardent pro-lifer ever since.</span></p> <p><span>However, his real beliefs keep peeking through. His statement last summer that he would support a grand-child who sought an abortion and that in the end it was \"her choice\" could have been lifted from a pro-choice pamphlet. The Bush-Quayle campaign has also dispatched Barbara Bush to give her view on abortion (that it shouldn't be a political issue) in order to pacify some pro-choice Republicans. The Bushes aren't alone in their deviousness, though.</span></p> <p><span>The Clinton campaign says the Arkansas governor supports the Freedom of Choice Act, which would make restricting abortion very difficult, and has made itself into the \"pro-choice campaign.\" But Clinton is playing a political game as well.</span></p> <p><span>According to a 1986 letter to a constituent reprinted recently in The New York Times, Clinton said, \"I am opposed to abortion and to government funding of abortion.\" The 1989 review of state abortion policies by the National Abortion Rights Action League said that Clinton \"refused to state a position on abortion.\" And that same year (the year before what was predicted to be a tough reelection fight), Clinton signed into law a bill requiring parental notification for abortion.</span></p> <p><span>Then, in a process Clinton's aides call \"evolution,\" the governor's position changed--most radically when he entered the race for the presidency. He now says he supports government funding for abortion through Medicare subsidies and opposes \"any federal attempt to limit access to abortion through mandatory waiting periods or parental or spousal consent requirements.\"</span></p> <p><span>Clinton has even gone so far as to admit that he would impose a litmus test on his Supreme Court nominees, something even Bush won't admit publicly.</span></p> <p><span>That's an evolution Charles Darwin would be impressed with.</span></p> <p><span>The effect of the decisions by Bush and Clinton is to hamper real debate on abortion. Little can be achieved when both sides are mouthing the inflexible slogans of the abortion extremists.</span></p> <p><span>This kind of susceptibility of the two major parties to special interests like the hard-line pro-choice and pro-life movements lies at the root of much of the widespread dissatisfaction with the current party system.</span></p> <p><span>The irony of these moves is that the great majority of voters are where Bush and Clinton aren't: in the middle.</span></p> <p><span><i>David L.

{"title": "Home Alone | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>M</b>edia pundits and other observers have derided President Bush's recent veto of the family leave bill as evidence of a hypocritical stance on family values. They think his claim to be pro-family should include support for such bills. (He even implied as much during the 1988 campaign.)</span></p> <p><span>But closer analysis reveals that Bush is subtler than these folks thought. His stance on the family leave issue actually fits perfectly with the image of womanhood implied in his administration's family values rhetoric.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>f passed the bill would have required companies with 50 or more employees to grant them up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave (with health insurance coverage) in the event of a family medical emergency or the birth of a child. Bush's criticism of this proposal was twofold. First, he expressed concern that more regulations would keep American business from competing well against foreign competitors. (He conveniently ignored the fact that most industrialized countries already have family-leave laws, which in some cases even mandate <i>paid</i> leaves.)</span></p> <p><span>Second, and more important, Bush tossed a bone to traditional conservatives who believe that the essence of conservatism is keeping government from engineering citizens' private lives. The president remarked that policies about family issues should be \"crafted in the work-place and not in Washington, D.C.\"</span></p> <p><span>This latter point deserves closer attention. Despite his pseudo-libertarian rhetoric, Bush is hardly the man who's going to get government off our backs. His hard-line stance on abortion is the most obvious indication that he thinks certain family issues, like pregnancy, require governmental regulation.</span></p> <p><span>Moreover, he <i>did</i> involve the government in the family-leave issue after all when he proposed, in place of the bill, a system of tax credits for companies which voluntarily give their workers family-leave benefits. This was a classic fence-straddling gesture: offering companies incentives to treat their workers humanely but not demanding that they do so.</span></p> <p><span>Bush's remark about keeping government from determining a family's priorities was also rather disingenuous. Why would Vice President Dan Quayle make \"family values\" a campaign issue unless his administration believed not only that a certain type of family was best but also that a Republican presidency would help transform American families into that model? Clearly they imagine some role for government in the moral development of the family.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>t may well be that this belief, and the image of womanhood implied in it, are among the unspoken motivations for Bush's veto. Rather than implying a cynical reversal of his \"family values\" position, his opposition to the family-leave bill is in fact consistent with his particular pro-family stance--his definition of family, that is.</span></p> <p><span>The Republican party looks back, with partly justified nostalgia, to the days when the average American kid lived with two married parents, a daddy who worked and a mommy who stayed at home. And they have one good point: If one loving caregiver is good for a child, two are even better, especially when one is there full-time. Yet they go too far when they insist that this type of family not only functions better but is morally superior and right for everyone.</span></p> <p><span>By vetoing the bill, Bush is trying to impose this family structure artificially on women by making them choose between their jobs and their sick or newborn children.</span></p> <p><span>I emphasize women because the burden will fall more heavily on them. If they are single parents, they will have to leave work to care for their children because no one else will do it.</span></p> <p><span>And if they are married, chances are that the stay-at-home parent will turn out to be mommy anyway. Men who quit their jobs to raise kids are still perceived as wimpy and unreliable by employers, who often expect women, but not men, to make their jobs a secondary priority.</span></p> <p><span>The Republicans are right that a sick or newborn child would be better off with a full-time caregiver. But they seem to think that in families in which no one fills this role, selfish female ambition alone is to blame. In this context, the family-leave veto comes off as a punishment for rejecting what Marilyn Quayle thinks is women's \"essential nature\": child-rearing. If women don't want to raise their kids his way, Bush seems to be saying, businesses shouldn't be asked to make their lives easier.</span></p> <p><span>But Bush chooses to ignore two realities: First, that most working women <i>must</i> work--their decision has as much to do with economics as with ambition. And second, that women who want to work should be able to do so without a social stigma.</span></p> <p><span>Anyway, Bush's attitude actually prevents the very thing Republicans say they want to accomplish. Family-leave provisions would allow women to be at home for their kids without sacrificing the economic stability of a career.</span></p> <p><span>But in the end, Bush's actions demonstrate that he's more interested in stigmatizing and coercing than in helping those who must juggle a career and a family.</span></p> <p><span>The family-leave veto proves that for Bush, \"family values\" means \"Women stay home.\"</span></p> <p><span><i>Jendi B.

{"title": "Mad as Hell | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>A</b>T LAST! The recession appears to be on its way out, or perhaps it's over already. But in any case, the end is in sight and I'm delighted--not for the same reason most Americans are (the economy? So what?) but because we can soon say goodbye to a lot of hideous self-pity and endless hair-brained schemes to put the country back on its feet.</span></p> <p><span>You see, the recession was so much more than a recession. It was a national mentality. It gave meaning to American politics and drove popular culture. From Tom Harkin's government works projects ideas to popular support for tax cuts (and even throwing out the weighty tax system), the recession was not limited to being a small, temporary downturn in the business cycle. God no! It was the fucking Great Depression all over again. It was Heaven's judgement on the United States. Government was supposed to stop everything and end the recession--no, not the recession: the RECESSION.</span></p> <p><span><b>M</b>ORE THAN anything else, the recession had a perverted moral quality to it. Bill Clinton recently had a political ad in which he talks to a group of ordinary folks (see below for \"the oppressed middle class\") explaining America's problems. The country, you see, is in such bad shape (read: RECESSION) because \"we\" lost sight of \"traditional values\" in the 1980s. That's right:<i> We lost sight of traditional values</i>.</span></p> <p><span>The thinking was that American's fundamental moral character changed spontaneously in 1980 and the recession was a JUDGEMENT FROM GOD on us for our sins. It was a penance for greed <i>a la</i> Reagan and Boesky. It was <i>not</i> just a downturn in the country's real GNP--no, no, no. If we were better people, it would never have happened.</span></p> <p><span>Many believed the recession, being divine punishment, would never end. Popular culture witnessed long-term relative American decline and it saw the recession, and it linked the two. The result was a maze of political ideas and common myths: we need a work ethic back, we need political vision, we must buy American, we need a fundamental restructuring of the way our economy works.</span></p> <p><span>Some Crimson editors in a not so recent editorial dissent linked the recession to the presence of affirmative action programs. It dawned on no one that no matter how good our economy could ever be, recessions will still happen. They are a fact of life.</span></p> <p><span>Economic fluctuations just happen, and there is no way to get rid of them. \"Fundamental problems\" and \"recession\" should never be mentioned in the same breath. They are both quite capable of occurring completely independently of each other.</span></p> <p><span><b>B</b>UT THERE was more to the Clinton esque idealism of just retribution for <i>lazy voodoo economics</i>. Something about the hardships of zero growth and increased unemployment brought out the worst in Americans. For one thing, the people <i>just had</i> to blame Bush for the recession. This is the oldest political tragedy in the books; Americans are incapable of differentiating what the government can do from what it cannot.</span></p> <p><span>Bush was blamed because he \"didn't care\" about the average guy and because he \"didn't do enough\" to make things better. Of course, it goes without saying that the government <i>should</i> do something to help. If homeless people can't find jobs, well, that's one thing. But if the majority is hurt, then so much for the free market and \"hands-off\" government. And so much for bringing down inflation.</span></p> <p><span>It also went without saying that Bush <i>could have</i> done something. Government can do anything, right? Bush can just waive his little finger and make everything better. If we can get so many government programs with such low taxes, then the normal laws of cause and effect don't apply to politics. Our paternalistic government is omnipotent. Which means that Bush is a BAD, BAD person. He just stood there watching while good, decent Americans went without jobs.</span></p> <p><span>This litany became tiresome fast. Overnight our president went from Persian Gulf victor and pioneer of the New World Order to an out of touch goof with \"no vision.\" Now things will change back. The recession is over, and Bush will once again become \"a good guy,\" just in time for November.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE BIGGEST losers of the recession, however, were the Japanese--all of them collectively. They became one entity (referred to by Newsweek as \"Japan,Inc.\") out for the sole purpose of screwing over the USA. The USA, you see, didn't lose jobs because that's what happens in every natural economic downturn. No, we were <i>exporting them to Japan</i> Free trade is fine if you're a fuddy duddy economist trapped in an ivory tower, but for real people in the real world the catch phrase was (and is) \"Buy American.\" Economists might have studies and data, but they don't truly understand our economy an all its subtle nuances; only the untrained, Nintendodulled masses understand that.</span></p> <p><span>Hard times bring out class struggle and this recession gave the middle class in awareness of its own existence and the realization that--oh my God--it was <i>oppressed.</i> The solution was tax cuts at once. The deficit? What? The middle class had heard quite enough about the need for more taxes, Didn't anyone read its lips in 1988? Fiscal reality and time delays aside, <i>clearly</i> tax cuts were the obvious solution.</span></p> <p><span>And once the middle class decided it existed, it declared itself \"mad as hell.\" In fact, it is so mad that maybe as much as forty percent will go to the polls in November. Why exactly it is mad is nuclear. Perhaps it was the recession, which elected officials didn't cause. Maybe it was the savings and loan scandal that was a direct result of the industry deregulation the voting public was so in love with in 1980. Or it could even have been House members bouncing checks, even though no taxpayer money was involved.</span></p> <p><span>Voters are certainly not named because of homelessness, or because of the budget dificit or because of the depletion of the ozone layer--these problems are too big and too hard to solve. They aren't even visually upset because government policy is shortsighted and inefficient--whenever a politician espouses rational planning he is very quickly voted out of office. Maybe the American public is just angry because of relative decline--of which it is the cause.</span></p> <p><span>I don't know who said it first, but in a democracy we don't get the government we want; we get the government we deserve, and in November that will be George Bush. The recession brought out the worst in this country, and I'm glad it's ending because I don't think I can stand it another minute.</span></p> <p><span><i>Thomas S.

{"title": "Barrett Outlines Political Vision for State, Nation | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>State Sen. Michael J. Barrett '70 says he has no political aspirations.</span></p> <p><span>It's an odd statement coming form a man who has a national reputation as an advocate for school reform. And that's no small feat for a mere state senator.</span></p> <p><span>Comfortably ensconced in his wood-paneled office at the State House, the Cambridge senator--whose district includes Cambridge, Watertown, Belmont and parts of Allston-Brighton--says he cannot chart his political career. Many political supporters, however, say that he is destined for a higher post.</span></p> <p><span>A lawyer and full-time politician, Barrett has earned a reputation not only as a crusader for educational reform but also as a shepherd of one of the country's first gay and lesbian anti-discrimination laws and an unyielding antagonist to Senate President William Bulger.</span></p> <p><span>This reputation coupled with his grassroots approach to politics will be his ticket to a bright political future, Barrett's backers say.</span></p> <p><span>Barrett's political involvement began during his years as an undergraduate. He was intimately involved in the anti-war movement, was a member of the University-wide student-faculty advisory council and was a <i>magna cum laude</i> graduate of the College.</span></p> <p><span>He was elected to the state House of Representatives in 1979 and to the state Senate in 1987. In addition to his state senate duties, Barrett currently serves as vice chair of the education and job training committee of the National Conference of State Legislatures.</span></p> <p><span>Despite hedging about any higher political aspirations in the future, Barrett has a clear political vision for the state, as well as for the nation.</span></p> <p><span>Barrett pushed for lengthening the school year for most of his five-year senate career. Not only has Barrett relentlessly plugged bills for educational reform in the senate, but he also authored an article that launched both his cause and himself into the national spotlight.</span></p> <p><span>\"With people worried about the direction of the country, the strength of the economy, and the emerging competition from our friends in Europe and Asia, it is time to give the matter [of a longer school year] another look,\" wrote Barrett in the November 1990 issue of <i>The Atlantic Monthly.</i></span></p> <p><span><b>`World-Class Excellence'</b></span></p> <p><span>According to the senator, the nation will \"not get to world-class excellence\" if the public education system remains intact. Barrett advocates longer hours in school, standardized testing, standard minimum expectations for curriculum, a school choice system based on the Cambridge public school system and a unique proposal for an \"hour-glass\" distribution of authority in the school system.</span></p> <p><span>Under Barrett's hour-glass design, the power to determine curriculum will rest with the parents and with state and national government--taking control away from local school boards.</span></p> <p><span>Barrett warns that unless there is \"radical change\" in the way the government molds the future of the public schools, private schools will reap a new population of students-- those dissatisfied with declining public education.</span></p> <p><span>But Barrett says the radical change embodied in Christopher Whittle's Edison Project--which would create a chain of affordable private schools nationwide--will rob the public schools of its middle-class \"customer base.\"</span></p> <p><span>The revolutionary change, says Barret, must be achieved by working within the public school system, not be abandoning it.</span></p> <p><span>And the first step to changing the system, says Barrett, is to keep the students in school longer.</span></p> <p><span>Barrett's call for extending the Massachusetts school year from 180 to 220 days not only provoked the attention of educators and politicians in the Commonwealth, but also turned the heads of natioanl leaders.</span></p> <p><span>Newspapers across the Bay State penned editorials and articles on the school year issue that Barrett championed virtually singlehandedly on Beacon Hill.</span></p> <p><span>And although some publications dubbed his proposals \"common sense idealism\" and contended that his plans \"won't happen in our lifetime,\" most lent support to his efforts and hailed his reform recommendations as long-overdue.</span></p> <p><span>\"The issue [of a lengthened school year] will no doubt raise heated debate and that's good,\" wrote Boston Globe columnist Christine McKenna. \"But someone had to bring the argument to the floor, and for that, Barrett deserves a gold star.\"</span></p> <p><span>In April, Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Thomas S. Foley appointed Barrett to a newly-formed National Education commission on Time and Learning. The commission is part of President Bush's educational reform plan, America 2000.</span></p> <p><span>While his championing of the issue of educational reform brought him into the spotlight most recently, Barrett first earned his reputation as a leader in 1989 after spearheading the successful effort to pass a gay and lesbian anti-discrimination law.</span></p> <p><span>Picking up the two-decade-old effort to pass the civil rights legislation when he arrived at the State House, Barrett is considered by many gay and lesbian activists to be the lifeblood of the movement to write the antidiscrimination bill into law.</span></p> <p><span>The watershed passage of the bill made Massachusetts the second state in the country behind Wisconsin to have such a liberal civil rights law.</span></p> <p><span>The law, first introduced in 1973, prohibits discrimination against homosexuals in employment, credit, housing and public accommodations.</span></p> <p><span>It seeks to protect people from discrimination on the basis of their sexual preference, just as it does on the basis of their sexual preferences, just as it does on the basis of sex, religion and ethnicity.</span></p> <p><span>\"He did a terrific job shepherding the law...it's been a major victory for us,\" says Katherine Triantafillou, member of Cambridge's gay and lesbian activist group, the Lavendar Alliance.</span></p> <p><span>She adds that the law is \"one of the pieces of the puzzle\" that has propelled the momentum for passage of similar laws in other states.</span></p> <p><span>\"For Massachusetts it's completely changed the spirit of the gay and lesbian community,\" says Gary K. Daffin, co-chair of the Massachusetts Gay and Lesbian Political Caucus, the oldest the largest homosexual rights organization in the state.</span></p> <p><span>Barrett's interest in reform also extends to Beacon Hill itself, where the Cambridge politician earned the reputation as \"the thorn in Bulger's side.\"</span></p> <p><span>Barrett has frequently sparred with State Senate President Bulger on proposed political reforms. But Barrett denies that his relationship with Bulger is antagonistic. Rather, Barrett simply says the odd couple \"disagrees very much on the future of the Democratic Party.\"</span></p> <p><span>Bulger is \"not an evil man at all,\" says Barrett.</span></p> <p><span>Nevertheless, the Cambridge legislator says he considers Bulger's leadership style tightreined.</span></p> <p><span>\"The problem is that you have a system that requires a certain degree of passivity on the part of the rank and file,\" Barrett says of the senate hierarchy. He criticized Bulger's \"top-down management style that runs contrary to all the precious thinkings about leadership.\"</span></p> <p><span>In order to curb Bulger's influence, Barrett joined a game of power politics when he actively campaigned to block the re-election of Bulger's leadership team during the months before the in-house elections in January. In his letter-writing campaign, he asked colleagues to withdraw support for Bulger. Barrett's challenge posed perhaps the greatest threat to what the Globe called \"Bulger's 12-year hegemony in the senate.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>`Bubbling With Ideas'</b></span></p> <p><span>Barrett says that under the leadership of Bulger, junior members of the legislature have been cut off form authority. And Barrett says this style of management stifles creativity.</span></p> <p><span>\"The senate has not been bubbling with ideas. It hasn't been up to the challenge of rebuilding the public faith in government,\" Barrett says \"And I think we can do much, much better.\"</span></p> <p><span>Barrett failed in his bid to block Bulger's re-election to the senate presidency. But Barrett and Sen. Lucile Hicks (R-Wayland) were successful in their efforts to limit the unilateral power of both Bulger and Senate Minority Leader David Locks (R-Sherborn) to appoint committees and immobilize legislation before it ever reaches the senate floor.</span></p> <p><span>Although his attacks on Bulger are often seen as a futile attempt to redesign an established part of the political landscape, Barrett says his efforts have improved the senate as an institution.</span></p> <p><span>\"I think we've opened up the institution quite a bit,\" Barrett says. \"People have been interested in covering the battle and have ignored the aftermath.\"</span></p> <p><span>In part because of Barrett's efforts, the senate has guaranteed debates every two years on its internal power arrangements.</span></p> <p><span>\"I feel victorious, although no one has handed me a crown with a scepter or an Academy Award,\" Barrett says with a laugh.</span></p> <p><span>But as Barrett sees it, his efforts to reform the Massachusetts senate are only part of a greater vision of American government.</span></p> <p><span>In addition to redistributing authority in the State House Barrett says he believes American leadership must be redefined.</span></p> <p><span>\"I grew up during the time of John F. Kennedy. These were years of enormous hope,\" the Cantabrigian says. \"What JFK did for us as youth, we will have to do four our selves in middle age.\"</span></p> <p><span>Barrett calls for a return to the quintessential American leadership and \"untapped idealism\" of Kennedy. But while the senator has a clear conception of what course American politics should take, he himself, is unsure of his own political future.</span></p> <p><span>When pundits speculated that Joseph P. Kennedy II might abandon his U.S. House seat two years ago to seek the governorship, Barrett says he considered making a bid for the position. But now, Barrett appears to have forsaken any designs he had on the House seat, saying that Kennedy is \"just settling in\" and that \"he's doing a wonderful job.\"</span></p> <p><span>Although Barrett does not flatly deny any higher aspirations, he says his family--his wife Nancy and twin daughters Hannah and Lily--will be important factors in deciding whether to seek another office.</span></p> <p><span>But Barrett's aides and many of his constituents say they believe the Cambridge senator has what it takes to make it to the national political stage.</span></p> <p><span>Kenneth A. Bamberger '90, Barrett's legislative aide and the former campaign manager for Cambridge City Councillor Francis H. Duehay '55, says he is struck by the intelligence Barrett shows when he deals with the complexities of various issues.</span></p> <p><span>And Bamberger adds that when he visited neighborhoods asking for signatures to put Barrett's name on the ticket in the upcoming senate race, he found that Barrett had a loyal constituency.</span></p> <p><span>Barrett has gained a particularly large following from the special interest groups he has served over the course of his career.</span></p> <p><span>\"We're always supportive of people who champion our cause,\" Daffin says. \"He'd be terrific in a higher office.\"</span></p> <p><span>Barrett is up for re-election in the fall and his supporters don't seem to be worried at all. He's not expected to face a challenge and he long ago demonstrated his ability to win even in a tight campaign.</span></p> <p><span>But his constituents should not be surprised if they do lose Barrett in the future. The legislator has created a strong consolidated power base during his two-decade political career and that, supporters say, makes a higher office within his grasp.</span></p> <p><span>Barrett himself does admit, \"I can see myself in a higher political office.\"</span></p> <p><span>But when and where, according to legislator, depends on \"whether there are useful things I can accomplish\" and \"whether my political course is favorable.\" And that, says Barrett, has yet to be determined.</span></p>"}

Reich's efforts for the Clinton campaign.</span></p> <p><span>Reich has been a friend of the Democratic nominee since both were Rhodes scholars at Oxford University.</span></p> <p><span>Reich, author of <i>The Work of Nations,</i> is widely credited for developing much of Clinton's economic plan. In the days prior to the New Hampshire primary, Reich stumped for his candidate, mostly trying to convince the press corps that Clinton's economic proposals would be the most successful at lifting the financially troubled Granite State--and the nation--out of the recession.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>lthough no single Harvard scholar probably has as much of an impact on the Republican side as Reich has on the Democratic, in sheer numbers, Harvard has more links to the Bush administration According to Institute of Politics Director Charles T. Royer, several Kennedy School professors get regular calls from administration officials.</span></p> <p><span>Roger B. Porter, formerly a Kennedy School professor, now works on domestic policy issues in the Bush administration. And spring IOP Fellow John Ellis, in addition to authoring a rejected plan for media election coverage, frequently shares ideas with Roger Ailes, formerly a key campaign official for Ellis uncle, George Bush. Ellis says that while Ailes is not on the Republican payroll, he enjoys sort of a \"senior eminence\" in the campaign.</span></p> <p><span>And other bush administrators, including budget director Richard G. Darman '64, have attended the University and often return for advice and consultation. \"There are people like Darman and others who are in and out of here and working in the administration,\" Royer says.</span></p> <p><span><b>H</b>arvard has had other effects on the political scene this year. The corner stone of the machine that will likely run the upstart campaign of Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot came together at Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>Thomas W. Luce III, a longtime Perot associate and former Republican Texas Gubernatorial candidate, will probably play the role of campaign manager for Perot, who has not yet officially announced his candidacy. Luce was an IOP fellow in the fall of 1990 when he met James Squires, them a fellow at the Joan Shorenstein Barone Center for Press, Politics and Public Policy at the Kennedy School. Luce asked Squires to come on board as Perot's press spokesperson.</span></p> <p><span>But while political connections still exist, most Harvard affiliates say the association is not as strong today as it once was.</span></p> <p><span>During World War II, President James Bryant Conant '14 spent so much time in Washington that he was forced to promote his dean of the Faculty to provost and put his in charge of the day-to day operations of the University.</span></p> <p><span>According to Ellis. The heyday of Harvard influence in Washington was the presidency of John F. Kennedy '40 during the Kennedy era, the fabled Cambridge-Washington shuttle became famous for transporting Harvard's ideas to the halls of Congress and the White House.</span></p> <p><span>\"The New England academic community was plugged into Washington in a big, big way in the early and mid-1960s,\" Ellis says.</span></p> <p><span>The most prominent Harvard professor who moved to the beltway during Kennedy's reign was McGeorge Bundy, who stepped down as dean of the Faculty of arts and Sciences to become national security adviser.</span></p> <p><span>Many of the ties began to be severed, however, as the '60s drew to a close, Ellis says he believes that the widespread opposition in the academic community to American military involvement in Vietnam was the beginning of the end.</span></p> <p><span>Ellis says he believed the election of Richard M. Nixon, followed by republican administrations in 20 of the last 24 years helped \"cut Cambridge out of the inner circles of government,\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Cambridge is a pretty liberal place, and these are pretty conservative administrations,\" Ellis says.</span></p> <p><span><b>S</b>till, the connections between Harvard and the administrations following Kennedy's were not completely broken. John H. Dunlop stepped down as dean of the Faculty to become Nixon's secretary of labor.</span></p> <p><span>And while his days as a Harvard professor werelong behind Henry A. Kissinger '50 when he becamesecretary of state, his ties to the schoolremained.</span></p> <p><span>In the Carter administration. Nye served asundersecretary of state, and under Ronald Reagan,Baker Professor of Economics Martin S. Feldstein'61 chaired the Council of Economic Advisers.</span></p> <p><span>But Nye believes that time and the Harvardmystique have exaggerated the Cambridge-WashingtonLinks especially during the Kennedy-Johnson years.</span></p> <p><span>\"There's a lot of mythology about that. I thinkyou have to be careful to extract myth fromreality,\" Nye says. \"Just the word 'Harvard ispart of the myth-making.\"</span></p> <p><span>Still, not everyone is as willing to write offthe connection as a complete myth.</span></p> <p><span>Departing Associate Professor of GovernmentMark A. Peterson, who teachers a course called\"The American Presidency,\" argues that the shuttle\"certainly continues to exist,\" although in aslightly different form.</span></p> <p><span>Peterson himself has shuttled to the Capitolseveral times in the last year to testify onhealth reform before congressional committees.</span></p> <p><span>\"The modern government probably has a smallpercentage of people involved\" in the shuttling,Peterson says. \"That involvement has a muchgreater impact on government and policy optionsthan it has on the electoral process.\"</span></p> <p><span>And all three of the experts agree thatHarvard's impact on the 1992 election will beminimal. Ellis thinks the reelection of his uncleis a foregone conclusion, seeing no other possibleoutcome given the mathematical possibilities ofthe Electorla College. And Nye and Peterson simplydon't think the advice of individuals from any oneinstitution can have a significant impact.</span></p> <p><span>Peterson says very little affects the outcomeof an election besides the economy. peace or war,party popularity and the like. \"Of all thepossible factors affecting the election of1992,...whatever happens at this institution, thatimpact is going to be way down,\" he says.</span></p> <p><span>Part of the reason for the University's declinein influence is the growth of other sources ofpolitical clout. As public opinion polls play anincreasingly powerful role in shaping policy, themore abstract political prognostication ofacademia is forced to take a back seat.</span></p> <p><span>The popularity of research institutions, or\"think tanks\" as they are commonly known, mightalso be blamed for the decrease in professorialpower. Still, Harvard professors are oftenintimately connected with these institutions.</span></p> <p><span>The Brookings Institute, a think tank inWashington, D.C., employs as fellows and guestscholars several one time Harvard instructors,including the director of its economics programs,Henry Aaron, and guest scholar Lincoln Gordon '34,who was Ziegler professor of internationaleconomic relations from 1936 to 1961.</span></p> <p><span>And Loeb Associate Professor of the SocialSciences Margaret Weir plans to leave Cambridgenext year to be a senior fellow in residence atthe institute.</span></p> <p><span>The University exerts influence on nationalpolitics not just by sending its scholars toWashington but also by bringing Washington to itsscholars.</span></p> <p><span>Every two years, the Institute of Politics runsa six-day training program for new members ofcongress.</span></p> <p><span>\"What we strive to do is help to better preparepeople,\" Royer says. \"We try to get them to lookat the issues from a broader perspective.\"</span></p> <p><span>Royer said it is \"impossible to tell what kindof effect the training has on first-yearlegislators, but acknowledged that with theunusually large turnover he expects in Congressnext session--Royer predicts as many as 120 newmembers--the potential for impact on policy isgreat.</span></p> <p><span>\"It's just a big group of people.\" Royer says.\"It's going to have an effect.\"</span></p> <p><span>Although the number of Harvard scholars in theupper echelons of the White House may not be aslarge as in the days of Kennedy, Harvard makes itsmark. Professors share insights with the nation'slawmakers, people associated with the Universitystill take part in campaigns and administrationsand Harvard faculty remain involved with nationalpolicy questions.</span></p> <p><span>The shuttle between the Potomac and the Charlesstill exists, Royer says.

{"title": "Kennedy School Looks for Cohesion | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>After years of expansion, the Kennedy School of Government this year focused on consolidation. With a new dean at the helm, the school is seeking to create a more cohesive institution.</span></p> <p><span>Littauer Professor of Public Policy Albert Carnesale succeeded Price Professor of Politics Robert D. Putnam as dean of the school in November, after serving one semester as acting dean.</span></p> <p><span>The former academic dean says the goal of his deanship will be to \"consolidate\" the school's resources and create a more efficient machine.</span></p> <p><span>\"We've gotten students more engaged in the activities of our research centers, for example,\" says Carnesale. \"We've gotten staff and the administration more engaged and informed about teaching and research activities in the school.\"</span></p> <p><span>Many of Carnesale's colleagues describe his deanship as more active and open than his predecessors,\" saying his efforts have done much to galvanize the community.</span></p> <p><span>\"Graham Allison was extremely intelligent and visible. Putnam was put her too brief a time [two years] to leave a specific imprint...[but] he was very concerned about academic standards,\" says Marvin Kalb, Murrow professor of press and public policy.</span></p> <p><span>\"Carnesale comes in a time when the school is searching for a new definition of purpose...He's been here long enough to know where the school has been and where it's going,\" says Kalb, who is also the director of the Joan Shorenstein Barone Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy.</span></p> <p><span>Pierce Professor of Technology and Public Policy Harvey Brooks says, \"I think he's somewhat better in communicating with the faculty than his predecessors.\"</span></p> <p><span>In addition to consolidating resources, Carnesale is trying to strengthen the school's ties to the greater Harvard community. He is active in the University's academic planning process and is bolstering the Kennedy School's programs in education, economic policy-making and health policy-making, programs that Harvard's other schools are interested in.</span></p> <p><span><b>Consolidation</b></span></p> <p><span>One of Carnesale's achievements has been reorganizing the structures of the faculty and administration, says Francis M. Bator, Ford Foundation professor of international political economy.</span></p> <p><span>According to Bator, Professor of Public Policy David T. Ellwood, who will replace Carnesale as academic dean, \"will principally be responsible for the management of personnel issues and staffing.\"</span></p> <p><span>Two other positions were created through consolidation to assist the dean. \"Joe Kalt [Professor of Political Economy] will be responsible for research centers..[and Baker Professor of Public Management Herman B.] Leonard will be responsible for the curriculum,\" he says.</span></p> <p><span>Another example of Carnesale's attempt to consolidate is appointing junior faculty to new posts created by consolidation, according to Kennedy School spokesperson Steven R. Singer. This will enable more faculty members to be more active in the Kennedy School community, he says.</span></p> <p><span>\"I suspect that is also going to be a kind of liberating experience with people not feeling bogged down in bureaucracy,\" Kalb says.</span></p> <p><span>Even with all the changes this year, old concerns such as faculty diversity remain. Approximately 200 students attended a December really calling for diversity in Kennedy School's faculty hiring. The event, held at the ARCO forum, came a day after Carnesale hosted a \"town meeting\" to personally address concerns.</span></p> <p><span>And in April, many Kennedy School students joined their Harvard graduate school peers in a one-day \"Strike\" for diversity.</span></p> <p><span>Carnesale assured students that the situation is improving. According to Executive Dean Richard E. Cavanagh, new junior faculty appointments, which were announced this week, are an example of Carnesale's commitment to providing diversity.</span></p> <p><span>Of the 10 junior faculty members appointed, Cavanagh says, \"two are women and two are people of color.\"</span></p> <p><span>Although steps are being taken to increase diversity, measures to improve the school's financial situation appear to have met with more immediate success. Not only has the school managed to eliminate last year's $300,000 deficit, which has been atrribiuted to the construction of the new Taubman building, but the school approaches Commencement with a $100,000 surplus, according to several faculty <t>members.<p>The reversal of the deficit was achievedlargely by cutting some administrative costsacross the board and consolidating severalofficers, according to Singer. at the same time,the school managed to actually in crease theamount of financial and it offered to students, hesays.</p><p>\"It took a substantial amount of time, effortand emotional action to work out.

{"title": "How About Some University in the University? | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>O</b>NCE AGAIN, our country has lurched into a crisis. So once again, it's time for America's blowhards to start playing the blame game.</span></p> <p><span>George Bush blamed LBJ. Jerry Brown blamed George Bush. Dan Quayle found an intriguing scapegoat: Murphy Brown. (Murphy Brown?) Mickey Rourke of <i>9 1/2 Weeks</i> fame took it upon himself to blame Spike Lee. <i>(Mickey Rourke?)</i></span></p> <p><span>Needless to say, this infantile finger-pointing is not going to improve the dismal state of race relations in America. Blame Congress, blame Reaganomics, blame the conservative Court, blame the fascistic cops, blame the unruly rioters until you're blue in the face--the fact remains that Americans of different skin colors are not getting along with each other very well.</span></p> <p><span>Even at Harvard, a University community that proudly trumpets itself as the diversest of the diverse, race relations are a mess. That became painfully clear this February, after the Black Students Association (BSA) invited Leonard Jeffries to speak at Harvard. Leaders of a huge coalition of campus organizations--Hillel, Raza, the Asian-American Association, the Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian Students Association (BGLSA), even the Undergraduate Council and The Crimson--addressed a huge anti-Jeffries protest outside Sanders Theatre.</span></p> <p><span>Inside Sanders, the seats on the floor were reserved for BSA members, most of whom cheered enthusiastically throughout Jeffries' speech. The spectators in the mezzanine and balcony seats were predominantly non Blacks, and predominantly silent.</span></p> <p><span>The divisions were stark, and cut along obviously racial lines: Blacks versus non-Blacks, glaring across a gulf. No communication. No middle ground.</span></p> <p><span>It was a scary evening.</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>E CAN ALL AGREE that racism is bad, that all people are created equal, that sensitivity and communication and diversity are good, good. At this University, you probably couldn't find 40 genuinely racist students, people who truly believe that Blacks or whites or somebody is inferior by nature of their skin color. And even if you could find 40 racists, you wouldn't be able to find any who would admit it in public.</span></p> <p><span>Yet racial antagonisms persist, even at Harvard, and occasionally they explode. Nobody actually says anything particularly racist, but accusations of racism fly freely across the chasm. Sensitivity becomes hypersensitivity, and everyone ends up pissed off.</span></p> <p><span>Case in point: This April, Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations Director S. Allen Counter co-signed a long, nasty letter accusing \"Crimson writers active in Hillel\" of racial insensitivity and bias, of using this newspaper to promote their own \"racial agenda.\" And then all hell broke loose.</span></p> <p><span>The Crimson fired back a long, nasty editorial accusing Counter--an administrator specifically responsible for fostering racial and ethnic sensitivity on campus--of insensitivity to Jewish students. Several leaders of Hillel wrote letters to The Crimson expressing similar sentiments. One former Hillel chair filed an official complaint with President Rudenstine, calling for Counter's resignation.</span></p> <p><span>The next series of letters featured attacks on the counterattacks on Counter's attack. One letter, signed by another broad coalition of Harvard's minority groups (not including Hillel, of course) repeated Counter's complaints about Crimson sensitivity, while affirming their satisfaction with Counter's efforts to improve intercultural understanding.</span></p> <p><span>The Crimson, as usual, got the last word. (It's nice to own the presses.) In an editorial titled \"Now, A Time to Heal,\" the staff called for a cessation to interracial hostilities, praising Rudenstine's call for the Harvard community to \"stop blaming each other.\"</span></p> <p><span>In the same editorial, The Crimson trashed Counter for his refusal to apologize for a 1985 article he wrote for <i>Crisis</i> magazine titled \"Racial Slurs.\" The Crimson claimed that the article perpetuated anti-Semitic stereotypes about Jewish control of the media and Jewish racism.</span></p> <p><span>One dissent to the editorial complained that the staff had failed to call for Counter's resignation. Another dissent complained that the staff had failed to call Counter an anti Semite.</span></p> <p><span>Oy vey.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>F THERE IS a consistent theme to the Counter affair, it is the participants' willingness--you might say eagerness--to ascribe the worst of motives to their intellectual opponents.</span></p> <p><span>Counter started it by assuming that The Crimson's erratic coverage of minority issues was a result of some kind of a \"racial agenda\" as opposed to the well-intentioned incompetence that generally pervades our building. We may be woolly-headed, but we're not racists.</span></p> <p><span>Counter's letter was ill-conceived and inaccurate, but in our typically self-righteous knee-jerk form, The Crimson overreacted, escalating the conflict. Instead of talking to Counter and trying to figure out where he was getting his misinformation (from a multitude of students who had come to his office with serious concerns about The Crimson, as it turns out), we trotted out a full page of our standard Armageddonesque anti-insensitivity rhetoric: \"unbelievable,\" \"downright scary,\" \"ridiculous,\" the works.</span></p> <p><span>We didn't say Counter was an anti Semite, but we came damn close. According to everyone who has worked with the man, there isn't an anti-Semitic bone in his body.</span></p> <p><span>How could all of this alienation have been avoided? Basically, the members of this community need to trust each other a bit, to put ourselves in each other's shoes, to give communication a chance before downshifting into ballistic mode.</span></p> <p><span>A newspaper that miscovers minority issues, an administrator who writes an ill conceived letter--these are things to talk about, but they aren't evidence of racism or anti-Semitism. Those are strong words, and people around here tend to abuse them. This isn't war. There's no need to demonize the enemy.</span></p> <p><span>In all honesty, nobody on either side of the Counter debate believes that Jews are greedy or that Blacks are stupid. Was somebody offended by somebody's letter? Well, let's assume that no offense was meant until we learn otherwise.</span></p> <p><span>Was somebody \"insensitive\"? Aw, for heaven's sakes, let the sensors apologize, let the sensors suck it up, and let's all get on with our lives. Name-calling and resignation demands and I-said-you-saids aren't going to make anyone feel any better.</span></p> <p><span><b>S</b>O MUCH for sensitivity. Now let me say a few equally dismissive words about diversity.</span></p> <p><span>Diversity is the highest good at Harvard. It's celebrated, worshipped, whacked over the heads of the student body. We hear it again and again: Harvard is so <i>diverse!</i> Everybody here is so <i>different!</i> Different races, different religions, different activities, different home states, different home countries, even different sexual orientations! You might befriend a Black lesbian poet from Denmark! Or a Japanese-American tennis player from Iowa! Think what you might learn from such diverse people!\"</span></p> <p><span>I'm not arguing that diversity is bad. Clearly, few of us would want to attend a school where everyone shared the same color, creed and interest.</span></p> <p><span>But here's another thing I've learned from diversity at Harvard: Different people aren't necessarily that different after all. Ms. Denmark and Mr. Iowa can probably find a lot of common ground. They're not aliens, after all. They're people.</span></p> <p><span>This is not particularly earthshaking. I heard it a million times on Sesame Street long before I ever heard of Harvard. But Harvard is so obsessed with its celebration of diversity, the variety of individual life experiences that set us apart, that it forgets about what might be called university, the commonality of human existence that brings us together.</span></p> <p><span>Instead, we identify ourselves with our group--BSA, BGLSA, Hillel, The Crimson--and define ourselves in opposition to other groups. So some members of the BSA insist that The Crimson send a Black reporter to cover its elections, arguing that white reporters necessarily lack the \"sensitivity\" and \"understanding\" to grasp minority issues. So The Crimson assumes that non journalists just don't understand how to run a newspaper.</span></p> <p><span>It's obviously a question of perspective, which happens to bring me to <i>Perspective,</i> Harvard's liberal monthly. This year, <i>Perspective</i> began hosting discussion forums on feminism, on gay issues, on politics, and publishing the transcripts. The funniest thing about these forums--<i>Perspective</i> editors joke about it all the time--is the participants' near-pathological need to qualify everything they say according to their racial and sexual particularities. \"Speaking as a straight white male...\" \"Coming at it from a Black gay angle...\" As if their opinions had no relevance otherwise. As if we couldn't understand \"where they were coming from\" without knowing the color of their skin, the gender of their sexual partners.</span></p> <p><span>So on one hand--the \"university\" hand--you have the banality of Depeche Mode \"People are people, so why should it be; that you and I should get along so awfully?\" It's not so banal when it comes from a victim of racial injustice like Rodney King, who held a press conference to jump-start the national healing process. \"Can't we all get along?\" he asked.</span></p> <p><span>On the other hand--the \"diversity\" hand--you have the opportunity for discovery of self and discovery of heritage, along with the danger of insulation and tribalism; You have access to a heightened appreciation of the unique characteristics of those \"unlike\" yourself, at the risk of obscuring the simple, shared qualities of human beings that help us get along.</span></p> <p><span>Diversity is no less important than \"university,\" but we're getting force-fed one without the other. And as a straight, white, skinny, blue-eyed, pro-choice, Long Island raised, Clinton-supporting, commitment fearing male journalist with a gay roommate and a bad haircut, I'm worried.</span></p> <p><span><b>M</b>OST OF MY FOUR YEARS at Harvard have been spent along the Canaday-Sever-Lemont-Crimson-Quincy axis, so I've probably walked in and out of the Yard through Dexter Gate 1000 times. Everyone knows the Charles Eliot inscription on the way in--\"Enter to Grow in Wisdom\"--but I'd bet I'm one of a handful of Harvard students who have memorized the inscription above the exit--\"Depart to Serve Better Thy Country And Thy Kind.\"</span></p> <p><span>Yet another Cambridge commonplace we've heard a million times is that the Harvard students of today are the nation's leaders of tomorrow. That's kind of unsettling. Around here, whites and people of color get along fine in sections, in rooming groups, in social settings. But in the arena of public discourse, they're at each other's throats.</span></p> <p><span>Hypersensitivity and hyperdiversity are part of the problem. The challenge, I suppose, is to find a satisfactory way for all of us to serve our country (presumably, diffusing racial antagonism would be a good start) while serving \"our kind\" (presumably, this would not preclude the diffusing of racial antagonism).</span></p> <p><span>These ultraserious, touchy-feely, namby-pamby pleas for unity are not my style--I've always been abrasive, sarcastic, rhetorically overwrought and damn proud of it. But race relations will be our generation's defining issue. Somehow, the subject does not seem the slightest bit funny to me. And anyone who sat in Sanders Theatre that icy February night would agree.</span></p> <p><span><i>Michael R. Grunwald '92 was the editorial chair of The Crimson last year.

In addition, liberals have often failed to support tough crimeprevention policies.</span></p> <p><span>For many whites, a new American dilemma has emerged--a conflict between America's meritocratic ideals and its race-based preferential treatment in hiring, election districting and school choice. President Reagan tapped into this dilemma, galvanizing a slice of white working voters around \"a new conservative egalitarianism,\" as Thomas B. Edsall of the Washington Post and Mary D. Edsall '65 wrote recently.</span></p> <p><span>Few of those in power have articulated sensible ways to deal with this disaffection. Conservatives fail to admit that discrimination still exists, often hidden away from the federal government in the private sector.</span></p> <p><span>And they refuse to concede that the Great Society worked for the people it reached. The Black middle and upper-middle classes have grown more than twofold in the last two decades. The number of Black and Hispanic professionals has risen drastically.</span></p> <p><span>Furthermore, majority and minority liberals fail to acknowledge what white working-class voters have lost in what has become a contest for increasingly limited government resources. A city's best schools, its best jobs and promotions, federal housing subsidies--all came to be contested by Blacks for the first time, and rightly so.</span></p> <p><span>But liberals have not dealt with the explosive political ramifications of the ideologically defensible policy of affirmative action. Urban whites competing with Blacks have felt disadvantaged by the very policies their tax dollars paid for. The GOP has exploited this divide and reaped the electoral benefits.</span></p> <p><span>The Los Angeles violence is only one example of the consequences of years of conservative leadership and stagnation in Congress. Unemployment in South Central is estimated at more than 50 percent. Crime and illegitimacy have skyrocketed and graduation rates have plummeted. Clearly, it's time for a change.</span></p> <p><span>The problem is not a shortage of new ideas, however. <i>The New Republic</i> suggests switching to community-rather than city-based policing, providing more drug treatment and nixing welfare in favor of a guaranteed jobs program in the style of the Works Progress Administration.</span></p> <p><span>In congressional testimony last Thursday, Progressive Policy Institute (PPI) President Will Marshall--the major idea machine for Gov. Bill Clinton--suggested a Police Corps program to exchange college funds for police service, a civilian version of the G.I. bill, expanding the earned income tax credit, raising work-discouraging wage limits for Medicaid and Aid to Families with Dependent Children and contracting out to private companies devoted to finding jobs for welfare recipients.</span></p> <p><span>And Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack F. Kemp talks endlessly about \"empowerment\" and \"enterprise zones,\" by which the government would give tax and regulation breaks to firms that locate in low employment, high poverty areas.</span></p> <p><span>Some of these ideas are better than others. The PPI proposals, for example, seem particularly well reasoned.</span></p> <p><span>The enterprise zones, on the other hand, would probably entice businesses to areas that <i>desperately</i> need them from areas that still need them badly. As Michael E. Kinsley '72 wrote recently, \"What will Jack Kemp say to a white working-class area that loses a factory to an `enterprise zone'?\"</span></p> <p><span>But regardless of the merits of these plans, the important goal now is to drive some new ideas onto the national agenda of ordinary voters.</span></p> <p><span>That will require disentangling tough but fair stances on crime and social decay from racism. It will require drastic reform of welfare to break cycles of dependency and disaffection.</span></p> <p><span>For the Democrats, it will require policies and rhetoric which address the concern of both Blacks in the underclass and white working-class voters. If affirmative action is to continue and aid to cities is to increase (and we believe both should happen), the costs must be shifted onto wealthier Americans. In short, this will require ending the largest upward income redistribution in history.</span></p> <p><span>Inertial and short-sighted American businesses must stop blaming taxation and regulation (which have severely declined in the Reagan-Bush era) for their own unwillingness to respond to the changes brought about by globalizing the American economy.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>LL THIS WILL REQUIRE, in short, massive political and social change. And, to be honest, such change probably won't be implemented to the extent the nation needs. Not because the American political system has become \"gridlocked\" or \"stagnated\" beyond belief, as this year's anti-politicians (namely Edmund G. Brown Jr. and H. Ross Perot) would have us believe. This has always been true.</span></p> <p><span>The reason, unfortunately, is simply that most voting Americans don't like change very much--if change means what the Republicans say it means: higher taxes with few benefits.</span></p> <p><span>Corporations will have to engage in messy and expensive restructuring. Already strapped middleclass Americans (both minority and majority) will have to work more, save more and study more.</span></p> <p><span>And those who want change most desperately participate least in the political system. Perhaps the best we can hope for, then, is a president committed to some change--or at least the ousting of a president who has shown his inability to work for <i>any</i> change.</span></p> <p><span>Refusing to change can only lead to more South Centrals, more poverty and less participation in the structures of politics by those who need them the most. It can only lead to more David Dukes and more Leonard Jeffrieses. It can only lead to a new, even deeper American dilemma, one that we cannot afford to face.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Voting for the Insiders' Outsider | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>S</b>IX HETEROSEXUAL MEN Named to Cabinet. Drug Testing Mandated Every Morning For Federal Employees. Sideburns Eliminated From the Executive Office Building.</span></p> <p><span>For the first time in American history, a fascist becomes president.</span></p> <p><span>This is what happens in the best-case scenario for the Ross Perot campaign, and as he leads several national polls (including in pivotal states like California and Texas), the idea of a half-businessman, half-general, never-held-public-office-before president seems not so farfetched.</span></p> <p><span>The problem with Perot goes beyond his lack of political experience and his authoritarian tendencies. The question is more fundamental: What exactly does he stand for? And once in office, could we control what he would do?</span></p> <p><span>Perot has long maintained that position papers and seven-point plans are insignificant, and many voters seem to agree. Indeed, writers in such publications as <i>The Washington Monthly</i> have suggested that silver-bullet, Clinton-style specifics may somehow reveal a lack of real substance.</span></p> <p><span>But hard-headedness and supposed courage does not make for substance either. And voting for a strong leader like Perot without any sense of where he would take the country could mean a roller-coaster ride without a place to get off.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>F THERE'S ONE THING that H. Ross Perot is, he's master salesman. From his days as a sales prodigy at IBM to his legendary sale of a school reform plan to the Texas legislature, Perot has built his reputation on using a combination of pressure, money and \"commonsense\" persuasion to make the hard sell.</span></p> <p><span>Don't get me wrong. Anyone who expects to be an effective president needs to be a persuasive vendor in the marketplace of ideas. And this quality would make Perot--or any candidate who can mobilize support for ideas and actions--a policy-making force to be reckoned with.</span></p> <p><span>But for all his sales feats, Perot is currently pulling off his best job yet--the creation and selling of his own image. Perot as the populist. Perot as the ultimate democrat. Perot as the maverick outsider. Perot as the candidate unsullied by the dirty hands of government. Considering the facts of Perot's career, it's been a masterful sell.</span></p> <p><span>According to Perot and his supporters, the political world is a mess. Gridlock and stagnation rule the day. The only people with voices are the special interests represented by the Washington lobbyists who are corrupting our glorious democratic system. Perot is the White Knight--ready to ride in from his outsider, above-the-fray, private-sector perch and purify democracy.</span></p> <p><span>But a look at Perot's history, as reported in the media in recent weeks, reveals shrewd use of the corrupt system about which he complains.</span></p> <p><span>Perot owes his meteoric rise of the past months to the backbone of politics since 1960: TV. Eschewing usual campaign techniques, Perot has taken his candidacy directly to the people via the studios of Larry King.</span></p> <p><span>But Perot has always known that television was a key ingredient to political success. During the Nixon years, Perot offered to buy a television station and newspaper to help spread the magic of the Nixon message.</span></p> <p><span>Such dealings with government taught Perot something else: When you want to get something done, hire a high-priced lobbyist. Preferably one who held a high government office. Indeed, that was how Perot pushed his school reform package through the Texas legislature. According to Thomas Toch's <i>In the Name of Excellence,</i> Perot brought in one of the state's most powerful lawyers, along with three of the most expensive lobbyists in Austin, known around the capital as \"the $100,000 boys.\" Two of them were former assistants to the speaker of the Texas House of Representatives.</span></p> <p><span>Even his business ventures, contrary to public perception, have been heavily dependent on government. His mutlibillion dollar company, Electronic Data Systems, became a corporate monster by acquiring large government contracts to computerize government records.</span></p> <p><span>And in a remarkable story in The New York Times, reporter Dean Baquet traced how Perot and his son managed to override the judgment of the Federal Aviation Administration and get the federal government to subsidize the building of a high-technology airport on Perot land.</span></p> <p><span>The result: a multiplication of the value of the Perot land. And it was all made possible by a little ride in Perot's private helicopter with then-Speaker of the House Jim Wright, since ousted for ethical violations.</span></p> <p><span>In short, Ross Perot is no outsider. In fact, he's the consummate insider--a guy with the connections, money and savvy to play the game. Indeed, he has often won at the political game, but if you believe his pitch, he has never even been a player.</span></p> <p><span>The message of the Perot story is simple: If you work hard and make a lot of money (or if you stumble upon a lot of money somehow), you too can have the access and political influence you always wanted. If Ross Perot is running against the system and those that corrupt it, then he's running against people like himself.</span></p> <p><span><b>B</b>UT PEROT SEEMS to have an answer to the money=influence problem which he took advantage of during his career: Appeal to the people. Bypass the lobbyists and special interests. All laudable goals.</span></p> <p><span>But along the way, Perot wants to forget about representative democracy as well. Simplify things. Make it direct. Have national electronic \"town meetings,\" with H. Ross himself as chair of the national town council.</span></p> <p><span>Perot-style town meetings, however, would be no more than a sham. They would be no more than a regurgitation of Perotisms--he'd make sure of that. Why? Perot hasn't really learned to be interested in what the people want--few businesspeople are. The nature of running a business is just fundamentally different from the work of a politician--you care about what makes the most profits and not what's best for the people. And even as corporate executives go, Perot was known to have a particularly autocratic style.</span></p> <p><span>The Perot approach--at least as he tells it--works like this: Identify a problem, find a solution, implement the solution. No nonsense. After all, consensus is for \"sissies.\" And when you're a multibillionaire, you get the feeling you know what you're doing. Ross has his ideas, and he is not running for president to listen to the ideas of others.</span></p> <p><span>Voters like Ross Perot because he's a doer--and as a slick political operator and autocrat, he would no doubt \"get things done\" as president. But what \"things\"? If we are going to grant this guy so much power, we should get some idea of what he would do with it.</span></p> <p><span>For example, Perot says he intends to cut the deficit. Like many candidates, he says he'll go after \"waste.\" But to really make a dent in the deficit, he'll actually have to go after programs. What programs would he cut?</span></p> <p><span>Representative democracy is too messy for Perot--and so are the checks that go with it. If we become disillusioned with President Perot, where will we turn? To a cowed Congress? To another White Knight?</span></p> <p><span>So if you're sick of democracy and want a guy who can sell his personal series of fix-it plans to the country, fine. If you want a guy who doesn't mind trampling on the Constitution to achieve his ends, then go ahead and pull the trigger. And if you want a guy whose accomplishments through government illustrate everything--particularly the marriage of money and power--that's wrong with American politics, then Perot's your man.</span></p> <p><span>Just get ready to put your hand over your heart and give a firm salute to the television. The maestro of political manipulation wants our vote. Let's make sure we know what we're voting for.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Super Soaker Squirt Weapon Spurs Boston Controversy | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>While George Bush and Boris Yeltsin may be reducing their stockpiles of nuclear weapons, the arms race is certainly escalating in Boston. Forge those puny water pistols of the days past, now there's the Super Soaker.</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps this year's hottest-selling summer fun item, the Super Soaker looks like a neon machine gun and can shoot a stream of water up to 50 feet; the largest size, Super Soaker 200, holds two liters of water.</span></p> <p><span>Two liters and fifty feet means plenty of fun for today's kids who look beyond dated cowboy role models to the superior fire power of Rambo and the Terminator.</span></p> <p><span>The Super Soaker craze may be the latest sign of a jaded society's need for ever-increasing thrills: more drug use, more transvestites on <i>Donahue,</i> more fire power in our water guns.</span></p> <p><span>Whatever the reason for their popularity, the guns has become not only the fastest selling toy but also the most controversial.</span></p> <p><span>Earlier this month a Boston woman and her child were shot in the fact with a Super Soaker loaded with bleach, and another child was shot to death when the target of his Super Soaker attack retaliated with a real gun.</span></p> <p><span>Concerned that the toys could lead to further outbreaks of violence, Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn called on stores to voluntarily remove the water pistols from their shelves.</span></p> <p><span>According to opponents of the gun, a regular water gun attack can be shrugged off, but a trigger-happy individual is not likely to be so philosophical about being drenched by a forceful blast from a Super Soaker. The greater volume of the Super Soaker also makes a bleach attack more dangerous.</span></p> <p><span>And Flynn has painted the gun as a sort of \"gateway\" to urban violence the way marijuana is to hard drug abuse.</span></p> <p><span>But critics of the mayor have argued that to stop people from shooting each other the city should ban handguns not squirt guns.</span></p> <p><span>Many Boston stores have complied with the mayor's request and removed the Super Soaker from their shelves. But most have not agreed without reluctance--gearing the loss of a popular item will further hurt already lagging sales.</span></p> <p><span>Other retailers are striking a blow--or maybe a squirt--for individual liberties and the profit margin by maintaining that their customers are mature enough to decide for themselves whether to become water-toting Rambos this summer.</span></p> <p><span>Big chain stores like CVS, Bradlees, K Mart, Walgreen's, and Woolworth's have all ceased to sell the water gun in the area.</span></p> <p><span>But it still hurts to turn away customers looking for the water guns. \"People have been asking for them left and right--that's a lot of sales lost,\" says one employee at the CVS on Tremont Street in Boston, adding that all but one Super Soaker had been sold out by the time they decided to stop selling them.</span></p> <p><span>Bradlees' media relations specialist Coleman Nee commented that their Boston store may start selling Super Soakers again once they find out more about how the community feels. Nee said no consumers had ever asked them to stop selling it or ever said it was dangerous, yet the store had to act in the interests of the city of Boston, as represented be the mayor.</span></p> <p><span>\"It financially hurts us not to have them on the shelf, but I think the whole issue transcends mere numbers--it's a matter of community relations,\" Nee says.</span></p> <p><span>But isn't it just a water gun? Wasn't <i>Murphy Brown</i> just a TV show? Maybe a harmless entertainment is being blamed for unrelated social problems. Greg Miller, media relations specialist for Child World toy stores, certainly thinks so.</span></p> <p><span>\"it seems kind of silly...It seems as it this squirt gun has been chosen to be the scapegoat for larger problems,\" says Miller, \"It is just a squirt gun, after all.\"</span></p> <p><span>Although child World has several locations throughout the suburbs it has no outlets in the city and felt little compulsion to heed Flynn's letter.</span></p> <p><span>Some Boston stores are rising to the challenge, including just For Fun, the Sharper Image and Urban Outfitters. According to employees at Just for Fun, a toy store in Newbury Street, \"anything can be dangerous, What about a baseball bat?\"</span></p> <p><span>Beneath that attitude lies a deeper conviction among toy store owners: that stores can't and shouldn't try to second guess the few who will misuse the toy--it's impossible and short-changes the majority of customers who will not misuse the squirt gun.</span></p> <p><span>At Urban Outfitters in Cambridge, there is a principle to defend. \"I think people are going to be able to decide for themselves. If someone wants to get it, they should have the option,\" says the manager, \"It's not something that should be banned across the country.\"</span></p> <p><span>A squirt gun is an unlikely symbol for a libertarian movement and \"getting government off our backs.\" But if store owners are denied one of their most popular toys in a recession starved economy, the nest slogan heard on the streets of Boston could be \"live free or dry.\"</span></p>"}

A favorite pastime of the local seems to involve eating lunch in their parked cars as they gaze out at the sand. Not quite \"Beach Blanket Bingo.\"</span></p> <p><span>Wollaston's sand is the standard grayish stuff, laced with dried seaweed and a little shredded garbage. Closer to the shore, the sand becomes mucky and less-than-inviting to potential waders.</span></p> <p><span>At Wollaston there is one thing to eat: fried clams. Across the busy street is The Original Clam Box and Powers' Famous Fried Clams, two eateries that offer whole fried clam and fried clam strips at identical prices. Tony's Clam Shoppe has a more comfortable dining atmosphere, although the seafood plates are a bit pricey at $8.95 (for whole fried clam) and $7.40 (for fried clam strips).</span></p> <p><span>Revere Beach, on the other side of Boston, is nearly at the end of the T's blue line, right before the Wonderland racetrack stop.

Wofford | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>One full hour before the Kennedy Foundation fund raiser was even scheduled to begin, a lone taxicab pulled up in front of the massive John F. Kennedy Library.</span></p> <p><span>Out stepped an elderly man in a rumpled grey tweed jacket and equally wrinkled slacks. He reached into his back pocket for his wallet to pay the cab driver, then picked up a small brown tweed garment bag and walked past an indifferent press corps into the library.</span></p> <p><span>U.S. Sen. Harris Llewellyn Wofford Jr. (D-Penn.) had arrived.</span></p> <p><span>Wofford, 66, is so low-key, he doesn't wear studs on his tuxedo. When he announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate seat opened when Sen. John F. Heinz '63 suddenly died last May, the Republicans were overjoyed.</span></p> <p><span>After all, politicians are suppose to have polish and magnetism.</span></p> <p><span>\"He's an egghead type, and I don't mean that disrespectfully,\" Robert C. Jebelirer, the Republican president pro tempore of the Pennsylvania Senate told The New York Times last May. \"I just don't see Harris Wofford as having the personality to shake hands and rub elbows.\"</span></p> <p><span>Nevertheless, Wofford defeated former U.S. Attorney General Richard Thornburgh, 56 percent to 44 percent, by turning the election into a referendum on the policies of the Reagan-Bush era and on national health care.</span></p> <p><span>But even Wofford realizes his victory was part of a larger trend and not a personal vote of confidence.</span></p> <p><span>\"I think my election was a signal that people believe this country is on the wrong track,\" Wofford says. \"We triggered something interesting.\"</span></p> <p><span>But while the citizens of Pennsylvania may have voted for national health care, they got a senator whose entire life has been devoted to public service.</span></p> <p><span>Wofford's resume reads like that of a Nobel Peace Prize winner. He helped to introduce nonviolence to the American civil rights movement. He co-founded the Peace Corps. He was a special assistant to President John F. Kennedy '40 and wrote a book, <i>Of Kennedys and Kings: Making Sense of the Sixties.</i></span></p> <p><span>Wofford was elected in large part due to his pro-national health care stance, but his interest lies in public service. After all, Wofford is the embodiment of public service.</span></p> <p><span>\"I came through the election with a mandate, namely to try to get action for national health insurance,\" Wofford says.</span></p> <p><span>But give him a chance, and the conversation wanders away from health care and towards a vision that fuses New Deal and New Frontier values into a national youth service program.</span></p> <p><span>Wofford envisions creating a \"Peace Corps to America,\" a youth service program for the nation's parks and cities modeled on the Civilian Conservation Corps of Franklin D. Roosevelt '04 and Wofford's own Peace Corps. He hopes to enlist upwards of one-third of America's youth.</span></p> <p><span>\"It wouldn't be mandatory,\" Wofford says, adding that he hopes to adopt a Kennedy-style appeal to enlist support for the program.</span></p> <p><span>It is this vision of national service which Wofford plans to discuss in his Class Day address at the Kennedy School of Government today.</span></p> <p><span>These are lofty ideals in a time of cynicism and paranoia regarding big government.</span></p> <p><span>But Wofford speaks wistfully of a time when government was a good thing. \"Government used to be simple and clear\" Wofford says. \"It used to work.\"</span></p> <p><span>Wofford's idealism stems from a childhood shaped by Roosevelt and the New Deal.</span></p> <p><span>\"I fell very early for Lincoln, Roosevelt, the founding fathers,\" Wofford says. \"They were heroes of mine.\"</span></p> <p><span>Captivated by Roosevelt's fireside chats, Wofford became a fiercely partisan Democrat at age 10. He refused to ride in his father's car, for example, because it had a \"Landon for President\" sticker in the back window.</span></p> <p><span>Wofford's strong commitment to his ideals are refreshing in an age of flip-flops, empty promises and fence sitting. But Wofford claims that he chafes under the \"idealist\" label.</span></p> <p><span>\"I'm not an idealist,\" Wofford says. \"The nature of an ideal is that you don't achieve it in this world. I believe in following ideas where they lead, and they may lead into disappointment. I'm realistic about that.\"</span></p> <p><span>Wofford, born April 1926, began his life in politics at 16, when he was a Congressional lobbyist.</span></p> <p><span>The Tennessee native and his wife went to India after graduating from the University of Chicago in 1948 to study economics and Gandhi's civil disobedience tactics. They wrote about their findings in <i>India Afire</i> and proposed that the American civil rights movement adopt nonviolence as a credo.</span></p> <p><span>\"Gandhi's followers challenged me, sometimes in the direct form of \"Why have you never gone to jail against segregation laws?\" Wofford says.</span></p> <p><span>Wofford's nonviolence mantra won Martin Luther King Jr.'s support, and he arranged for the emerging civil rights leader to visit India to discuss civil disobedience tactics with Gandhi's followers.</span></p> <p><span>Wofford's friendship with King proved invaluable in the 1960 presidential election: When King was jailed in rural Georgia for driving without a license a week before the election, Wofford convinced then-Senator Kennedy to offer Coretta Scott King his help in securing King's release.</span></p> <p><span>\"The call\" helped Kennedy win the crucial Black vote and lifted the Massachusetts senator to victory over his Republican opponent, Richard M. Nixon.</span></p> <p><span>But his devotion to the civil rights movement did not stop outside the media spotlight. He was the first white to attend Howard University Law School since 1905.</span></p> <p><span>After such an eventful life, is the senatorship the pinnacle of his public career? To answer, Wofford gestured at the room around him, at the murals of Kennedy and his words which adorned the walls of the library.</span></p> <p><span>\"It's hard to sit here and look at John and not say that the Peace Corps and the Kennedy period were the top things in my life,\" Wofford says.</span></p> <p><span>\"But my present job is the best I've ever had, if only in terms of an opportunity to make a difference,\" he asserts.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Suspicion Creates a Catch-22 for Politicians | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>P</b>essimistic pundits of left and right agree that the cynicism and unpredictability characterizing this election year are the result of a \"leadership crisis.\" It is as if we've become convinced that anything a politician does is a mistake and probably a cover-up of something worse.</span></p> <p><span>Although the ability to criticize our incumbent and potential leaders is what keeps democracy and newspapers alive, this distrust can backfire. Disillusioned voters become so habitually suspicious that they find fault with any decision a politician makes, and rush to support a candidate with no platform simply because a person who makes no promises tells no lies.</span></p> <p><span>George Bush may be the candidate most damaged by this mood of suspicion. As the president, he can hardly claim to be an outsider, and his position as our present leader makes him and his administration the focal point for Americans' resentment about our current state of crisis, whether or not such blame is justified. One result of this is that the Bush administration is derided for failing to provide strong leadership, yet derided even more when it dares to attempt that role.</span></p> <p><span>The reaction to Bush's hard-line stance at the Earth Summit is a perfect example. Before the environmental summit, voters and the media had criticized him for doing nothing about the economy and for giving foreign policy priority over domestic affairs.</span></p> <p><span>Probably with this in mind, he took a courageous stance in Rio by defending American economic interests against an international consensus. Yet he was quickly mocked at home as the \"spoilsport\" in Rio, the undiplomatic one who selfishly focused on his own country's needs while the rest of the world was sharing and playing nicely.</span></p> <p><span>Bush's objections to certain aspects of the Rio treaties were all based on his decision to give America's economic problems priority, a choice that many of his current detractors recently clamored for him to make.</span></p> <p><span>The treaties contained provisions for reducing emissions of global warming gases and protecting endangered species. In their original form, these provisions would have undercut American patent laws and further restricted the development of industry and technology, making America even less able to compete in the world market. Moreover, Bush objected to provisions requiring America to donate billions of dollars to aid Third World countries in developing environmentally safe technology.</span></p> <p><span>Although Bush's liberal critics often faulted him for spending more money abraod than on domestic problems, he is universally portrayed as stingy and shortsighted once he attempts to reverse this trend. Trying to provide the type of leadership that the voters and the media have demanded, he is instead condemned for it.</span></p> <p><span><b>N</b>ot all our political needs or principles are compatible. Sometimes, as at the Rio summit, one has to be compromised for the sake of the other. But it appears that whichever Bush chooses, attention is focused only on the compromise, not on the principle he was trying to defend. Even if the kind of leadership we want is nothing but \"leading the people where they want to go,\" we make this impossible by wanting, on principle, to go in the opposite direction whenever someone tries to lead.</span></p> <p><span>Dan Quayle's critics reacted the same way to his attempt to infuse a dose of morals back into politics. Granted, the date on the medicine had expired around 1952.</span></p> <p><span>Yet the criticism was not merely directed at the inadequacy and insensitivity of his <i>definition</i> of family values; taunted as \"Reverend Quayle,\" he met with disapproval for daring to \"preach\" about family values at all. Never mind that voters often deplore politicians' failure to address the country's lack of moral direction.</span></p> <p><span>The more Quayle is derided for trying to address that need, however imperfectly, the less future politicians will try. Already H. Ross Perot thinks the word \"principles\" is nothing but a smokescreen to <i>conceal</i> one's values and positions.</span></p> <p><span>Bush and Quayle are not perfect leaders, and the past four years have hardly been perfect years for America. However, it is time we asked ourselves how much of the current \"leadership crisis\" is due to our presumption that politicians are guilty until proven innocent, and that contempt for the government is a sign of intellectual superiority.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Ross Perot Looks Corporate to the Core | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>A</b>bout six months ago, I was knocking on doors in New Hampshire, pitching a Ralph Nader presidency as the solution to America's problems.</span></p> <p><span>\"He's not a politician,\" I told the citizens of Manchester. \"He wants to reform the system.\"</span></p> <p><span>I was ahead of my time. Since February, the anti-incumbent, anti-Washington, anti-politician mood has coalesced behind one unlikely leader--not consumer advocate Ralph Nader, but Texas billionaires Ross Perot.</span></p> <p><span>Where Nader's raiders failed, Perot's posse has succeeded, at least so far. Perot has gained millions of signatures on petitions to put him on ballots nationwide, and his standing in the polls rival that of President Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton. More importantly, the still-undeclared candidate has gotten thousands of Americans involved in the political system and has given them a cause to believe in.</span></p> <p><span>Convincing regular people to get involved in politics and take over the government was what the Nader campaign was all about. I was all for it, and I still am. Paradoxically, though, watching the Perot campaign succeed with a variation on Nader's message has been profoundly disillusioning.</span></p> <p><span>I first came face to face with Perot at a rally on Boston Common in June. Perot, in a dark three-piece suit, stood and addressed the gathered masses.</span></p> <p><span>\"United teams win, divided teams lose,\" Perot said.</span></p> <p><span>\"Our goal should be alabaster cities.\" Perot said.</span></p> <p><span>\"If you've got somebody that's down the street, and you can help `em, right?\" Perot said.</span></p> <p><span>It was amazing. who could disagree with Perot? No one can argue for garbage can cities, and no one will tell you that divided teams win.</span></p> <p><span>As Perot was uttering truisms, I was getting uneasy. The anti-politician was sounding like a politician. And the people around me were eating it up.</span></p> <p><span>Perot has hired handlers--Ed Rollins and Hamilton Jordan--who are veterans of the sleaziest campaigns of year past. Perhaps they are partly responsible for Perot's refusal to get specific when it comes to policy questions or proposals.</span></p> <p><span>I got a taste of the famed Perot vagueness and slipperiness last week when I asked the Texas billionaire a question during a live ABC News electronic town meeting.</span></p> <p><span>Roughly, I asked Perot the following:</span></p> <p><span>\"Mr. Perot, you have said that as head of Electronic Data Systems, you did not prohibit employees from wearing beards. But in fact, in 1983 a federal judge found that Reggie Dallaire, an orthodox Jewish worker at your company, was fired for no other reason than his refusal to shave his beard. Through 1986, beards, striped shirts and even tasseled loafers were against EDS rules. How do you reconcile these facts with four earlier statements, and what do such strict rules say about your tolerance of people who dress or look or think differently than You,\"</span></p> <p><span>Perot ducked the question. He said that in the early days of his company, his employees had to dress a certain way in order to compete with IBM salespeople and in order to get through the doors of large corporations. He said that in 1983, the president of EDS was a Jew. And he said that he personally knew nothing of the Dallaire incident, and that he planned to look into it the very next day.</span></p> <p><span>But Perot didn't answer the questions about his own inconsistencies. He didn't answer the question bout his own tolerance. He didn't defend the rather odd corporate strictures of the company where he made his billions.</span></p> <p><span>And Perot ducked other people's questions, too. Again and again, the undeclared candidate responded to questions with statements that were beside the point.</span></p> <p><span>Here's another paraphrased example from the ABC town meeting:</span></p> <p><span>Questioner: Mr. Perot, you have said that abortion is a woman's choice. But what specific laws or measures would you support that would protect a woman's right to choose?</span></p> <p><span>Perot: I have said it before and I will say again, abortion is a woman's choice.</span></p> <p><span>The day after the show, a friend told me that he found the program boring. \"How often can you watch the guy sit there and not answer the questions? my friend asked.</span></p> <p><span>Corporate culture is the operative concept here, I think, Perot wants to run government like a good business, carefully analyzing problems in terms of cost and benefits, consulting experts and controlling costs.</span></p> <p><span>The analogy works, to a degree. Certainly, if our government is run like a business, it should be run like a good business, not a bankrupt business.</span></p> <p><span>But someone should tell Perot that government is different from business, and that government and business interests can differ, as in a labor negotiation, a minimum wage law or an environmental regulation.</span></p> <p><span>The analogy tells you something about the difference between Nader and Perot. Perot was building companies while Nader was fighting to get them to make their products safer for consumers. Perot is clearly a fan of the American corporate culture. His company banned striped shirts, for heaven's sake. Nader, on the other hand, thinks corporation is a major problem in America.</span></p> <p><span>We grow up corporate, Nader would say in his stump speeches, railing against Tony the Tiger and network television, praising good nutrition and reading. Nader says large corporations have too much influence over the government, and he advocates specific structural reforms to counteract those influences.</span></p> <p><span>Perot has profited handsomely from corporate influence (look at EDS and its Medicare contracts). And more importantly, Perot is corporate to the core. His press spokesperson, quick to refuse comment, responds to questions like the public relations flack of a Fortune 500 company. the candidate himself talks about revolutionizing American politics in 90 days, as though he were issuing some sort of quarterly report.</span></p> <p><span>It's all a very strange culmination of he trend Joe McGinniss called \"the selling of the president.\" We are at the stage when we seek a computer salesperson as our national leader.</span></p> <p><span>It makes me queasy, and it makes me wish the Perot followers had listened to Ralph Nader back in February.</span></p>"}

Edmund G. Brown Jr.'s delegates continued to drown out speakers and wave signs, clamoring for a speech from their hero. Their wish was granted Wednesday, when Brown spoke on behalf of his own nomination.</span></p> <p><span>Delegates listened intently to Cuomo's 25-minute speech on Wednesday calling for an end to 12 years of Republican programs, especially \"supply side\" economic policies. Their silence was broken only by their bursts of raucous applause.</span></p> <p><span>\"Supply side was just another version of the failed Republican dogma of 65 years ago--then called 'trickle down'--which led to the Great Depression,\" Cuomo said. \"And it has failed again.\"</span></p> <p><span>Cuomo compared the economy to a ship in which everyone except the captain, Bush, knows the vessel is headed for the rocks.</span></p> <p><span>\"[Bush] seems to think that the ship will be saved by imperceptible undercurrents, directed by the invisible hand of some cyclical economic god, that will gradually move the ship so that at the last moment it will miraculously glide past the rocks to safer shores,\" Cuomo said.</span></p> <p><span>Calling Clinton a \"new captain with a new course,\" the New Yorker portrayed the nominee as the ultimate agent of social and economic change.</span></p> <p><span>\"Bill Clinton believes that the closest thing to a panacea that we have is described by a simple four-letter word: work,\" Cuomo said. \"He has been living that truth all his life.\"</span></p> <p><span>The delegates' euphoria following Cuomo's speech was matched, however, by the nominee's untraditional appearance on the floor after his nomination.</span></p> <p><span>After Ohio's 144 votes put Clinton over the number needed for nomination, the 56-screen video wall broadcast Clinton's route from his viewing post at Macy's to the convention floor, where he shook hands and exchanged hugs with delegates and friends.</span></p> <p><span>John F. Kennedy '40 was the last Democrat to appear at the convention before his acceptance speech in 1960.</span></p> <p><span>\"The rules of this convention preclude my acceptance tonight,\" Clinton said from the steps leading up to the podium, \"but 32 years ago, another young candidate who wanted to get this country moving again came to the convention just to say a simple thank you.</span></p> <p><span>\"Tomorrow night,\" Clinton concluded, \"I will be the comeback kid.\"</span></p> <p><span>JFK was not the only Kennedy invoked Wednesday, as delegates viewed an eight-minute film on his brother, Robert F. Kennedy. The film was introduced by RFK's son, Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II, who represents Cambridge in Congress, and followed an appearance by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy '54-'56 (D-Mass.).</span></p> <p><span>\"It would be a source of great pride to both my brothers that so many of you here in this convention hall were first brought to politics by their urging and example,\" Edward Kennedy said. \"You are their living legacy.\"</span></p> <p><span>Both Brown and former Sen. Paul E. Tsongas also spoke on Wednesday in well-received addresses. Brown's speech largely ignored Clinton and called for sweeping government reform. Tsongas supported Clinton but urged Democrats to adopt a more moderate fiscal policy.</span></p> <p><span>On Tuesday, delegates voted down Tsongas' four minority planks to the platform before approving \"A New Covenant with the American People\" as the party's offical position paper.</span></p> <p><span>Later, former President James E. Carter addressed the convention, emphasizing human rights and praising Clinton's character.</span></p> <p><span>Criticizing American support for military action in Grenada, Panama, Nicaragua and Iraq, Carter pointed out that \"in none of these cases was Camp David or any other venue used to avoid conflict.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Our country should seek greatness in peace, not war,\" Carter said.</span></p> <p><span>\"I tell you, as you all know,\" Carter said late in his speech, \"[Clinton] is a man of honesty and integrity.\"</span></p> <p><span>The Rev.

{"title": "'G.I. Bill': A Spin on College Funding | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>NEW YORK--College students can expect major revamping of federal student loan programs if Democratic nominee Bill Clinton is elected in November and sticks to his party platform.</span></p> <p><span>The National Service Trust Fund, ratified Tuesday night as part of the party platform, has been dubbed the \"domestic G.I. Bill,\" named after the post-World War II program instituted by Franklin D. Roosevelt '04.</span></p> <p><span>Roosevelt's G.I. Bill has given $69 billion in education funding to over 20 million veterans, active-duty military members and reservists. And its inception in the 1940s launched the beginnings of Harvard's own financial aid system, according to Director of Financial Aid James S. Miller.</span></p> <p><span>Advocates of Clinton's version of the G.I. Bill say the new proposal, which Clinton introduced into the campaign several weeks ago, will enable more students to attend college and will benefit American society, as well. Party leaders agreed with the idea strongly enough to build it into the 1992 platform.</span></p> <p><span>\"Over the past 12 years skyrocketing costs and declining middle class incomes have placed higher education out of reach for millions of Americans. It is time to revolutionize the way student loan programs are run. We will make college affordable to all students who are qualified to attend, <i>regardless of family income,\"</i> reads the platform, with the emphasis in the original.</span></p> <p><span>Under the program, all Americans could borrow funds for college from the government. Students could repay their debts either by offering a percentage of their income over time or by participating in national public service projects.</span></p> <p><span>According to a Clinton campaign policy staff member, this \"national service\" could be performed in teaching, law enforcement, health care, peer counseling or other areas. The period of service would be between two and three years.</span></p> <p><span>If recipients choose to pay back the money as a percentage of their income, the commitment would likely be longer. The college debt repayments would be collected with the borrower's income tax each year.</span></p> <p><span>Supporters of the G.I. Bill cite the problems with the current system of college finance--inefficiency, high default rates and lack of funds for middle class families--as reasons massive overhaul is needed.</span></p> <p><span>The only existing model for the program is the \"Police Corps\" in Clinton's home state of Arkansas, in which students can receive state money for their education if they agree to serve a few years in law enforcement.</span></p> <p><span>A national program would completely redesign the current system of student loan programs, using the existing budget. The Clinton staffer said the government spends over $3 billion annually on student financial aid.</span></p> <p><span>That creates a possible drawback: Clinton aides agree that juggling such a major government program would create an organizational nightmare. Still, advocates say it will be more efficient than existing programs in the long run.</span></p> <p><span>The original G.I. Bill gave assistance to 7.8 million World War II veterans and 2.4 million Korean conflict veterans. Over the last three decades, it has aided 8.1 million veterans and active-duty service members of the Vietnam era and the peacetime military.</span></p> <p><span>Several new versions of the bill have been passed. The Vietnam-era version of the bill expired in 1989.</span></p> <p><span>The idea of a college-for-public-service tradeoff, Miller said, has \"been kicking around for awhile.\"</span></p> <p><span>Under one proposal, advocated by Rep. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), students would not receive financial aid unless they had done some sort of community or military service, Miller said.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard didn't support that plan, Miller said, because it robbed students of choice. Clinton's proposal, however, makes the service option voluntary.</span></p> <p><span>\"On balance, the concept to me as an alternative way to pay for college has some attraction,\" Miller said.</span></p> <p><span><i>Joanna M.

{"title": "Young Americans | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>NEW YORK--The Clinton campaign and the Democratic party are courting younger voters in a new move they hope will pay off in November's election.</span></p> <p><span>Aiming to harness the enthusiasm and energy of young Americans, the Democrats have been holding outreach training sessions for college Democrats this week. A ticket made up of two baby boomers (\"Young Guns,\" blared Newsweek's recent cover) is an appeal for generational change. And many of the platform planks adopted Tuesday night--including proposals for environmental protection, student loans and a pro-choice stance on abortion--appeared to be in line with the political views of the \"twentysomething\" generation.</span></p> <p><span>The stakes are high for Democratic nominee and Arkansas Gov. William Jefferson Clinton. Strong support and turnout from young voters could mean the presidency. Clinton remembers well the power of young people campaigning door-to-door for candidates like George McGovern in 1968--Clinton was one of those young people.</span></p> <p><span>Even from a cost-benefit perspective, an appeal to youth makes sense.</span></p> <p><span>\"You can get students to do a lot for a keg of beer. It's a pretty good investment,\" said James N. Harmon '93-'94, president of the College Democrats of America.</span></p> <p><span>In appealing to young voters, Democrats have ample room for improvement and face a fair number of obstacles. The history is discouraging--only 29 percent of eligible 18 to 25-year-olds actually cast votes in the 1988 presidential contest, according to the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate. Senior citizens are the most reliable voters, while young people tend to turn out much less often in elections.</span></p> <p><span>\"National politics, for my generation, has become irrelevant,\" wrote 22-year-old political writer Jonathan S. Cohn '91 in <i>Newsweek.</i> Cohn, a former Crimson president, wrote that young people may be more likely to get involved if a candidate expressly seeks their support.</span></p> <p><span>Low voter turnout is not the only obstacle for Democrats, who must also face the fact that many young people who voted in recent elections supported Republican candidates.</span></p> <p><span>To increase young voter turnout and Democratic success, the party is focusing on three factors: issues, organization and candidates.</span></p> <p><span>Students loans are important to many college-aged Americans, said Jennifer M. Bassuk, a senior at the University of Michigan and a political writer for the Michigan Daily. Clinton's proposal for a \"domestic G.I. Bill,\" which would provide student loans regardless of financial need, is appealing now because, Bassuk says, \"financial aid just isn't available to the middle class.\"</span></p> <p><span>Abortion is another issue that young voters will pay close attention to, said Robert M. Zivovich '93. \"Students are particularly interested in abortion simply because most of us will be having kids in the next 10 years or so,\" Zivovich said.</span></p> <p><span>And perhaps most important to students who are thinking of the future is the economy. Said Dartmouth senior Marianne M. Ruhl, \"For a lot of students, the question is 'Am I going to get a job when I graduate from this college I spent a lot of money to come to?'\"</span></p> <p><span>Democrats are trying to rally students behind these issues on campuses across the nation. That complicated organizational task has been assigned to Harmon and a team of political professionals. They say they have already had some success, bringing more than 2500 students to New Hampshire for the primary as well as bringing student volunteers to Pennsylvania to help elect Harris Wofford to the Senate.</span></p> <p><span>Officials say the youthful ticket is particularly suited to getting young people involved. And so far Clinton, aged 45, and his running mate Sen. Albert A. Gore '69 (D-Tenn.), age 44, have at least succeeded in stirring discussion among students.</span></p> <p><span>\"Everybody is talking about it,\" said C. Alexandra Choe, a University of Pennsylvania student in town for the convention.</span></p> <p><span>\"We talk about it a lot,\" said Harvard summer school student Sheila C. Donaldson.</span></p> <p><span>The challenge for the Clinton campaign is to get the students who are now just talking to begin campaigning and voting. And many would say that American democracy, which depends on citizen involvement for its vitality, faces a similar challenge. As Cohn says, \"getting young people involved in politics isn't only good for the Democratic party, it's good for America.\"</span></p> <p><span><i>David S.

BillClinton is the epitome of change.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>Party Not Unprepared</b></span></p> <p><span>Brown said that while the switch to atwo-person race certainly \"changes the dynamic\" ofthe campaign, it does not leave the partycompletely unprepared.</span></p> <p><span>\"We prepared for three-and-a-half years for atwo-person race, and that's what we're back to,\"he said.</span></p> <p><span>And while Perot's announcement may have stolensome of the Democrats' thunder, last night'sacceptance speech gave Clinton a uniqueopportunity to pull Perot supporters into theDemocratic camp, according to Associate Professorof Government Mark A. Peterson.</span></p> <p><span>\"In fact, this may be the most important momenthe will have in the campaign,\" Peterson said.</span></p> <p><span>Clinton, in fact, made a last-minute change tohis speech, seizing on Perot's description of a\"revitalized\" Democratic party which allowed theTexan to leave the race in good conscience.</span></p> <p><span>\"We are, as Democrats, in the words that RossPerot himself spoke today, a revitalizedDemocratic party,\" Clinton said. \"I am well awarethat all those people who rallied to his causewanted to be in an army of patriots for change.</span></p> <p><span>\"I say to them tonight, 'Join us and togetherwe will revitalize America.\"</span></p> <p><span>Both parties scrambled to pick up Perot'ssupporters yesterday, saying good things about theman they had assailed only days before. Both Bushand Clinton said they had learned an importantmessage from the groundswell of support for Perot.</span></p> <p><span>Immediate courtship of Perot loyalists maywork, Peterson said. But he suggested that, facedwith the initial disappointment with theircandidate's unexpected exit, his supporters mightnot yet be ready to listen--even to thenow-familiar mantra of change.</span></p> <p><span>As important as the uncertain future of Perotsupporters is the American economy, a factorequally out of Clinton's control. Bush'spopularity is inextricably tied to the financialsituation of the average family.</span></p> <p><span>Incumbent presidents almost always win,Peterson noted. When they haven't won in the past,he said, \"the economy has been in very badshape...and heading in the wrong direction.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>Future Uncertain</b></span></p> <p><span>Democrats cannot control the future any morethan they can predict the state of the economythis fall.

They see the Democratic partyof the last 20 years,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>Speculation in New York yesterday was thatRepublicans would begin a negative campaignagainst Clinton in earnest sooner because ofPerot's departure, and Republican Chair Rich Bondindicated yesterday that the Democrats' bitingconvention rhetoric opened the floodgates.</span></p> <p><span>But Brown claimed Bush could prevent vitriolicspots--if he did more than just make statements todistance himself from producers like Floyd Brown,who developed the Willie Horton ads.</span></p> <p><span>\"George Bush could stop this nonsense right nowif he was the kind of leader we need in the UnitedStates,\" Brown said.</span></p> <p><span>The advertising issue is less important thisgo-around, Peterson said, because a barrage ofnegative ads this year would not have the samedevastating effect it had in 1988.</span></p> <p><span>\"Michael Dukakis was, I think, really takenaback by the Willie Horton experience, and didn'tknow how to respond,\" he said. \"Bill Clinton isnot going to take a Willie Horton and notrespond.\"</span></p> <p><span>Most Democrats agree with Charles Morris, aClinton delegate from Selbaville, Dela., who saidClinton must \"just keep telling [Americans] hismessage.\" And just as important, Morris said,Democrats must stand with their nominee.</span></p> <p><span>\"We have to believe in him and have faith inhim and then work for him,\" Morris said, \"and Ithink everything else will fall in place.\"</span></p> <p><span><i>Joanna M.

{"title": "From Harvard Yard to Madison Square Garden | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>NEW YORK--Harvard has long been a nurturing womb for fledgling politicos and power brokers. And judging by the number of Harvard affiliates in attendance in various capacities here in New York, the Crimson political tradition is as strong as ever.</span></p> <p><span>Students and graduates of the University are helping to shape the Democratic National Convention here this week in roles ranging from vice-presidential nominee to \"shep-herd.\"</span></p> <p><span>Former Dunster House resident Albert A. Gore, Jr. '69 will share the Democratic ticket with Bill Clinton in November. The vice-presidential nominee will deliver an acceptance speech shortly before Clinton's speech Thursday night.</span></p> <p><span>Another convention bigwig is Robert E. Rubin '60, chair of the New York '92 host committee. Rubin's committee has been organizing welcoming events for the conventioneers, among them a Broadway Street party and Saturday's media greeting party in Bryant Park. Rubin, who studied economics at Harvard, is co-chair of the investment firm Goldman Sachs and a director of Harvard Management Company. He ran unsuccessfully for a seat on the Harvard Board of Overseers this spring.</span></p> <p><span>Among the more powerful undergraduates here at the convention is James N. Harmon '93-94. One of the 772 \"superdelegates\" at the convention, Harmon has been pressing the flesh and eagerly issuing invitations to various College Democrats of America parties from his office at Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters at the Hilton. As president of College Democrats of America, Harmon is a member of the DNC and there-fore a superdelegate who can vote for any candidate in tomorrow's first ballot. Other delegates are pledged to vote for particular candidates.</span></p> <p><span>Ethan Zindler '92 is another of the highest placed Harvard students here. An assistant press secretary for the Clinton Campaign, Zindler has coordinated press pools and traveled with the candidate.</span></p> <p><span>This week, Zindler is \"filling gaps\" in the press office. His name appeared yesterday as the press contact on Hillary Clinton's schedule.</span></p> <p><span>As the campaign progresses, Zindler thinks he will eventually be coordinating some kind of \"outreach to younger voters through media,\" which he sees as an important endeavor.</span></p> <p><span>\"We've been heading in the right direction, doing MTV, the Arsenio Hall Show and other things,\" Zindler said.</span></p> <p><span>Further down the ladder of Convention prestige (which hinges less on impressiveness of job title than on the lavishness of the parties the conventioneer can enter) is Brian J. Shortsleeve '95, a volunteer doing security work. Shortsleeve, who is working in Massachussetts Sen. John F. Kerry's office this summer, was given a blue blazer and told to direct traffic on the convention floor. Sean M. Becker '94 and Neil A. Cooper '91 are also working in convention security.</span></p> <p><span>\"It's not a big deal job,\" Cooper said. He said he hopes to join the Pennsylvania Clinton campaign after the convention.</span></p> <p><span>While most Harvard students working here are attached to the Clinton Campaign or the National Democratic Party, Justin P. O'Brien '94 is with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts' delegation. O'Brien is a summer intern with the Massachusetts Democratic Party and says he is doing \"general interntype work\" at the convention.</span></p> <p><span>\"It's crazy, but it's a lot of fun,\" O'Brien said of the festivities.</span></p> <p><span>As the volunteer convention jobs get less important, the titles become more euphemistic. Jason M. Solomon '93, deputy magazine editor of The Crimson, said he is at the convention as a \"shepherd.\" The job, according to Solomon, has nothing to do with sheep, but involves traveling with Clinton aide Bob Hattoy and making sure he gets to the right places on time.</span></p> <p><span>Down there with the \"shepherd\" task is \"visibility.\" Amy L. Busch '93 is \"in visibility,\" one might say in coventionspeak. Although it sounds more like an attribute than a job, \"visibility\" is actually a task here at the convention. Busch's responsibilities consist of making sure the \"Clinton for President\" signs are not too bunched up in any one corner, but well distributed throughout the convention floor.</span></p> <p><span>While Busch distributes the signs inside the convention arena, Stephen R. Kempf '92 will be selling T-shirts outside. In business with his brothers, Kempf has ordered 1200 shirts in eight different variations on the \"top ten\" theme. He expects the biggest sellers to include shirts listing the \"top ten reasons Republicans are losers\" and the \"top ten lies told by George Bush\" (lie number one: \"I am not a wimp.\").</span></p> <p><span>With the different people and the various jobs come varying degrees of idealistic and material interest in the convention.</span></p> <p><span>Gore and Harmon say they are driven by nothing less than a heartfelt desire to improve America.</span></p> <p><span>\"I'm here for one simple reason: I love my country,\" Gore said when Clinton announced his choice for the vice-presidency.</span></p> <p><span>Gore went on to say that he wants to be part of Clinton's efforts toward \"getting the country moving in the right direction again\" through \"responsible change.\"</span></p> <p><span>Harmon has a mission almost as high-flown. He said he sees the convention as an opportunity for showing people that politics can be positive. Politics, Harmon said, are \"a way to really change things.\"</span></p> <p><span>Ideas are also what moved Cooper to get involved in the convention. \"I'm attracted to Clinton and I'm attracted to the issues he's talking about,\" Cooper said.</span></p> <p><span>\"I had to do something to get Bush out of here,\" said Cooper, a former president of College Democrats of America.</span></p> <p><span>Less politically driven is Solomon, who said he is shepherding because he is \"just looking for an excuse to hang around.\"</span></p> <p><span>Solomon said he has \"no ideological motives.\" What brought him to New York, he said, was an attraction to the \"weird sort of excitement in the air.\"</span></p> <p><span>And, as any economist will confirm, money can be a motivation. If they sell enough of their T-shirts, Kempf and his brothers stand to make a $9000 profit in the next four days. That's enough to lure Kempf temporarily from his regular job at Salomon Brothers ta Wall Street investment firm.</span></p> <p><span>Ideology is not a factor for Kempf, either.</span></p> <p><span>\"It's just business,\" he said.</span></p>"}

Seventeen will publish a spread on 1600 Pennsylvania avenue's youngest resident; Sassy will run an interview and print every \"like\" and \"um\" Chelsea utters. She will be thrust headfirst into the role of American Spokesteen.</span></p> <p><span>A presidential parent, after all, is a springboard to media attention. The Reagan kids used it to their advantage: Ron Jr. gleaned a Hollywood career, albeit short-lived, and his sibling Patti Davis sold a mountain of books. But media coverage isn't always profitable, and is often uncomfortably probing. Reporters followed Amy Carter's exploits even after her father lost his reelection. Paparazzis flooded Caroline Kennedy's wedding. And the watchful, shallow eye of the media spared none of them from harsh scrutiny.</span></p> <p><span>WE AMERICANS are catty. We take perverse interest in appearances and perverse pleasure in gaffes. We support a magazine that annually features a list of the worstdressed celebrities. And we take our comedians mean-spirited, thank you.</span></p> <p><span>As maliciousness grows increasingly appealing,  image has grown increasingly important. Public  figures don't necessarily have to be  attractive--observe Ross Perot--but they do need charisma. And their every move is subject to hyper-examination. Back in the 1960 Presidential debates, Richard M. Nixon drew scorn for his sweat and his misapplied TV makeup. today, pundits overanalyze Barbara Bush's faux pearls. It's all part of the same game: looks first and substance later, if ever.</span></p> <p><span>People remember pictures, and the Clinton campaign has its share of winning images. In a precious film clip, teenaged bill Clinton shakes hands with President Kennedy. Bold Hillary Rodham strides across the Yale Law School library and introduces herself to a gawking fellow student.</span></p> <p><span>It also has its share of images that aren't so picture-perfect. Gennifer Flowers cries foul at a press conference. Bill grasps a joint and attempts to inhale. Poor Chelsea stands stiffly in a polka-dot dress.</span></p> <p><span>THE PICTURES, of course, only skim the surface, and a choice based on image alone is likely to backfire. George Bush learned this lesson in 1988 when he targeted a young, attractive running mate--who unleashes a stream of garbled English every time he opens his mouth. Dan Quayle seemed to follow the recipe for media appeal; he had the hair, the smile and the political family. Despite the calculations, something went awry.</span></p> <p><span>Al Gore's political career won't go the way of Dan Quayle's. Clinton chose the senator for far more than his all-American looks, and his fans in the party applaud his stands on the issues. But amidst the hoopla about his environmentalism and his foreign policy record, people still grasp for pictures. Why else do Democrats quiver in anticipation of a Gore-Quayle debate?</span></p> <p><span>The difference is, Gore <i>asked</i> to be subject to the image mill, and so did Quayle. It's politics as usual for them. But Chelsea  Clinton never wanted to be a star. It seems an unfortunate fate for a very normal 12-year-old. As if adolescence weren't wretched enough in solitude, hers is now entertainment for 50 million viewers.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Law to Make Colleges Safer; Require Sexual Assault Policy | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Two provisions buried within the mammoth Higher education reauthorization Act may make college campuses safer, advocates said yesterday.</span></p> <p><span>The act, signed into law last week by President Bush, drew widespread attention for the impact it will have on federal and lvy League financial aid programs. But parts of the act will also affect campus police departments and college sexual assault policies.</span></p> <p><span>One of the Act's sections, known as the \"Campus Sexual Assault Victims' bill of Rights,\" requires colleges and universities to develop a \"campus sexual assault policy.\" the act says such policies should include rape-awareness programs and standard procedures for handling sexual assault cases.</span></p> <p><span>It is so far unclear whether this portion of the act will affect Harvard's procedures regarding sexual assaults. Harvard's policy is currently under review following a report by the Date Rape Task Force last spring.</span></p> <p><span>Another section of the Act will stop college and university police departments from claiming that law enforcement records about students are actually educational records, which must be kept private under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. Some college police departments have been using that tactic to hide public information about students who commit crimes.</span></p> <p><span>Activists yesterday noted the newly-passed provisions with pleasure.</span></p> <p><span>\"These laws are making our campuses safer,\" said Howard K. Clery Jr., president of Security on Campus, a Pennsylvania-based advocacy group.</span></p> <p><span>Joshua A.

{"title": "IN RECORD NUMBERS, WOMEN POLITICAL CANDIDATES LOOK TO THE FUTURE | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The rooster, many agree, is the traditional political establishment--white, male and wealthy, with a reputation for neglecting women's issues. Promising to deliver and pledging to bring change, women candidates are flooding Federal and state ballots this year. And many suggest that this year's election results could permanently alter the pecking order of government goals and programs.</span></p> <p><span>On both sides of the political fence, women candidates have garnered much attention in this year's campaign. In part, their sheer quantity is enough to turn heads. Record numbers of women are running for Federal offices, and the trend continues on the state level. According to Karen L. Uminski, a Democratic candidate for the Massachusetts House of Representatives, 73 women are running for the State's lower house this year--twice as many as ran two years ago.</span></p> <p><span>The local numbers may be even more significant, Uminski says. \"State representatives are the farm team,\" she says. \"It's where a lot of people cut their teeth.\"</span></p> <p><span>Today's state legislators, she says, will likely be tomorrow's Congressional and gubernatorial candidates. And the more women elected to state offices today, the more will be represented in higher offices in the future.</span></p> <p><span>\"More doors open up to you as you progress,\" Uminksi says. The result, she predicts, will be a \"permanent change in our political structure.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>s important as the size of the woman candidate pool, however, are the reasons for its dramatic increase. Many observers say some outside force--or forces--must have prompted a change this significant.</span></p> <p><span>The Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on Justice Clarence Thomas' alleged sexual harassment of Anita Hill sent a rallying call to women politicians, says Wendy Kaminer, a visiting scholar at Radcliffe's Schlesinger Library.</span></p> <p><span>Kaminer's recent Atlantic Monthly article, \"Crashing the Locker Room,\" explores this new trend in politics.</span></p> <p><span>\"The Thomas-Hill hearings really did activate a lot of women,\" Kaminer says. \"The women who were angered by the proceedings were deeply angered.\"</span></p> <p><span>And anger often leads to action. The resurgence of popular feminism--much of it sparked by Hill's allegations--may \"propel more women to the polls,\" Kaminer says.</span></p> <p><span>Abortion, too, catalyzes female political involvement. Uminksi, 27, a former aide to Rep. Peter Vellucci, decided to run after Vellucci announced his retirement this spring. Uminski says she wanted to ensure that the abandoned seat remained a strong voice for abortion rights.</span></p> <p><span>\"Our legislature is very anti-choice,\" Uminski says, \"so to lose one pro-choice seat was really a little much for us to bear.\"</span></p> <p><span>Uminski's best-known opponent, Cambridge City Councillor Timothy J. Toomey, says he is pro-choice. But Uminski supporters say they have questions about how deep Toomey's commitment runs, citing his refusal to support a city council order endorsing the most recent Washington march by pro-choice supporters.</span></p> <p><span>Uminski says her experience canvassing this year has taught her that abortion affects voter turnout, as well. Uminski once worked as a campus coordinator for Mass Choice, an abortion-rights advocacy group. Many college women, she says, became more politically active as they grew involved in the abortion debate. \"It is symbolic,\" she explains. \"People aren't used to having their rights taken away from them.\"</span></p> <p><span>In its power as a litmus test, abortion is unusual, Kaminer says. Strong opinions on abortion can induce voters to abandon their party loyalties.</span></p> <p><span>\"Women may cross party lines to vote on the abortion issue before they will cross party lines to vote for another woman candidate,\" Kaminer says.</span></p> <p><span>Voting against party ties does not happen often, Kaminer says. And predicting the way the female electorate will vote is not as simplistic as it may seem. Pressing issues and a perceived need for greater female involvement can lead a woman to the voting booth, she says, but they can't necessarily make her vote a certain way. Issues, race, ethnicity and geography influence voter decisions, and gender is \"just one piece on the chessboard.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Women candidates had better not rely on women voting for them on account of sex.\" she says. \"For the most part, they do not.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>he law of numbers, however, says that if the current trend continues, more and more women will run for office--and women, over time, will hold more and more legislative seats.</span></p> <p><span>And Radcliffe President Linda S. Wilson, who has tried to propel Radcliffe further into the realm of public policy, predicts \"some reordering of priorities as women become involved and a more critical mass within the legislative bodies.\"</span></p> <p><span>It is hard to project how the government will change as its ranks are increasingly filled by women. And Kaminer is quick to issue another caveat. \"Women are not monolithic,\" she says. \"It is very unrealistic, and it is almost insulting, to expect women [legislators] to vote the same way.\"</span></p> <p><span>Politicians, Kaminer says, are overwhelmingly loyal to their parties. \"It is still a general rule in politics that people will vote with their party,\" she says, noting that Nancy Kassebaum (R-Kan.), one of two women Senators at the time of the Thomas hearings, \"voted as a Republican\" in favor of Thomas' nomination.</span></p> <p><span>But one quality may apply to all women candidates. \"They may take different positions on women's issues,\" Kaminer says, \"but they will pay more attention to them.\"</span></p> <p><span>Women politicians may place special emphasis on issues like sexual harassment and child care, Kaminer says.</span></p> <p><span>Wilson adds family and child welfare, health and education to Kaminer's list of issues. In addition, she says, women \"tend to look very carefully at relationship,\" and want to \"sustain the quality of the relationship for the long term.\"</span></p> <p><span>California State Treasurer kathleen Brown told Democratic delegates gathered last Tuesday that women are \"more open in our leadership, more human and more inclusive... because of who we are and what we've experienced as women.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>R</b>adcliffe Trustee Honey Skinner says the law of numbers alone may not be enough to turn women candidates into women officeholders. To help provide outside assistance for Republican women, Skinner co-founded, and currently directs, the Women's Leadership Network, a year-old organization that supports women Republican candidates.</span></p> <p><span>A Washington lawyer, Skinner works with the Women's Leadership Council to talk to Republican women and encourage the advancement of women in the party. Other organizations, including the bipartisan Emily's List, work to drum up funding and support for female Candidates--providing what Skinner thinks is a much-needed boost.</span></p> <p><span>\"Politics has traditionally been a very male-dominated place,\" says Skinner, whose husband, Samuel L. Skinner, is the White House chief of staff.</span></p> <p><span>Skinner notes that it is \"very difficult to raise money if you're a woman.\"</span></p> <p><span>Uminski agrees that women come to campagins with financial disadvantages. \"Women make 60 cents to every dollar a man makes,\" she says. Therefore, she says, they have less disposable income to donate to political candidates.</span></p> <p><span>In addition, Kaminer's article lists a host of stereotypes that may work against women in their bids for office: they lack the experience to manage foreign affairs, the aptitude to lead the military and the reliability to handle fiscal matter.</span></p> <p><span>But for every drawback, it seems, some feminine quality makes them appear better suited for office. And the mere fact that women are women--and aren't white males--may be enough to tip the balance.</span></p> <p><span>In a year when widespread desire for change nearly lead to a three-way Presidential race. Different is often desirable. Uminski says she expected her youth and her gender to be liabilities--but has found them to be among her greatest assets.</span></p> <p><span>Uminski believes women have appeal \"just because we're not a part of the political establishment...people are so tired of all of the same and more of the same.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>t last week's convention, Democratic leaders, promoting a renewed mission for their party, tried to capitalize on the widespread desire for change.</span></p> <p><span>All last week, the Democratic Party tried to present itself as a party of women and for women. Hillary R. Clinton's chocolate-chip and oatmeal cookies, distributed to delegates and journalists in Madison Square Garden, were only part of that effort. More important was the pro-choice, pro-woman rhetoric that inundated the convention. More important was the parade of women Senatorial and Congressional candidates that went before the assembled delegates and journalists.</span></p> <p><span>The emphasis on women, according to Democratic National Committee chair Ronald H. Brown, is in some ways a part of the political game.</span></p> <p><span>\"Women are the majority of voters in America,\" Brown said at the convention last Monday. There are major differences between Democrats and Republicans on child care, choice and parental leave, he said. \"We're on the right side of the issues...we're going to highlight these issues.\"</span></p> <p><span>Beyond this year's election, Democratic leaders last week said they see a pattern of ascendance for women in politics.</span></p> <p><span>\"I believe that women will be a majority of those elected this year to the United States Senate and I also believe that women will someday be a majority of the United States Senate,\" said Senator Edward M. Kennedy '54-'56 (D-Mass.)</span></p> <p><span>Former Texas Representative Barbara Jordan noted a trend toward a day when the party would nominate \"Madame President.\"</span></p> <p><span>This year may be the one to bring women into the government in larger numbers than before. But numbers, Wilson says, are only part of the battle. New women officeholders \"will be inexperienced, relatively speaking and have to earn their stripes.\"</span></p> <p><span>It will take years before they gain seniority, become chairs of important committees and shed some of the negative stereotypes traditionally attached to women politicians.</span></p> <p><span>\"Changes come about by increments,\" Wilson says, \"not by great huge leaps.\"</span></p> <p><span>But today's small changes could have a giant effect on the young generation of women voters--students and recent graduates who, current leaders predict, will someday find greater opportunity for their own political advancement.</span></p> <p><span><i>Ira E.

The Guam delegates grab their hot dogs and head for their seats.</span></p> <p><span>\"The man who will take back America is our next president, Our Next President!\" Carter said.</span></p> <p><span>The Democrats collectively gasp.

Kennedy, who, according to the polls, still has high ratings with women voters.</span></p> <p><span>With Our Next President is Our Next First Lady, dressed in a red, white and blue dress and gazing admiringly at her husband.

(At least, that's the way he explains it to reporters later on.)</span></p> <p><span>There is a momentary twinge of regret in Howie's young heart. He realizes that he has messed up his job.

He sees the happy, smiling faces of Our Next President and Our Next First Lady and the Democrats below. Howie President suddenly feels a surge of happiness.</span></p> <p><span>\"It doesn't get any better than this,\" Howie thinks, in the words of a beer commercial.

{"title": "The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>WASHINGTON--IN THE SUMMER of 1979, Jimmy Carter was attacked by a killer bunny. He was fishing near his home in Plains, Ga., when a rabbit actually swam up to his boat, prompting the ex-Navy officer to beat it back with an oar. Brooks Johnson, then an Associated Press reporter, witnessed the bizarre event and wrote a story about it. The \"killer rabbit\" became a metaphor for Carter's faltering presidency.</span></p> <p><span>George Bush's killer rabbit was the 1992 All-Star Game in San Diego on July 14. As his name was announced over the loudspeaker, a chorus of boos arose from the crowd. Not everyone booed, of course, but The New York Times reporter there estimated a 60-40 heckles-to-cheers ratio. That would be more than a landslide on November 3.</span></p> <p><span>It's even more surprising when you consider who goes to All-Star Games, especially in conservative San Diego, political birthplace of California's republican governor, Pete Wilson. Tickets to such games are expensive (40 bucks for the cheapest seats this year) and usually obtained by what Richard Ben Cramer, in his new book <i>What It Takes: The Way to the White House,</i> calls the \"corporate perks crowd\"--white and GOP-friendly.</span></p> <p><span>But that crowd hissed George Bush. In fact, much like Carter, Bush can't seem to get a break the summer before what he hopes will be his second election to the White House Just last Friday, family members of POW MIAs--another group Bush advisers thought would be polite--jeered the president at their annual meeting in Crystal City, Va. Now Dukakis-like, Bush was left angrily defending his patriotism and war record.</span></p> <p><span>Campaign aides and GOP members of Congress have begun to worry about their ticket. And more importantly, reporters want some explanation for Bush's inability to find the path so well- worn by expert Republican campaigners. It is this combination which has slowly cranked up the rumor mill now known as the White House.</span></p> <p><span>Ironically, neither left nor right finds his broader failures hard to explain. The right constantly cites his acquiescence to a tax hike as the reason for his and the economy's collapse.</span></p> <p><span>For moderates and liberals, the problems are broader: Without any vision for the country, he has allowed America to degenerate further into racial and ethnic tension and economic malaise. He had fought primarily for a capital gains tax cut instead of formulating a larger plan for the economy.</span></p> <p><span>And all this has happened at a time when the Cold War's end held so much promise for America, mainly in the opportunity to reorient our national priorities. Overseas, Bush spent billions and took thousands of lives to push back a dictator the administration built up--and then left him entrenched in power. And his directionless non-policy for the break-up of communist Europe has resulted in no leadership to help stop the killing in Sarajevo.</span></p> <p><span>But while this case is easily made, almost everyone is confused by Bush's failure to do what the Republicans have done best in their time in power--run decent campaigns.</span></p> <p><span>Obviously no one should write him off; the Republicans haven't even had their convention yet, But boos in San Diego? A 20-point plus deficit in the polls? Bush and his aides never expected that. And neither did reporters.</span></p> <p><span>THE MOST COMMON method reporters employ to investigate anything is to create a set of reference mnemonics for it. We often call this the \"background,\" and there's a background, or subtext, for every story. Al Gore for veep? He ran before; his wife hates dirty lyrics; he's big with greens. Boris Yeltsin visits the U.S.? He was here before and got drunk; his nation desperately needs our investment; he's growing unpopular at home.</span></p> <p><span>These subtexts shape the way a story gets covered. They add texture, but they certainly emphasize one set of points time and again. And often, reporters will be looking out for any bit of information that confirms their subtext.</span></p> <p><span>This is no less true for White House stories. And these days, the subtext of Bush stories has become: His campaign is in a tailspin.</span></p> <p><span>The subtexts (an idea I borrow from University of Virginia political scientist Larry J. Sabato and his 1991 book <i>Feeding Frenzy)</i> are reinforced by the chummy yet competitive nature of White House reporters.</span></p> <p><span>Those folks spend years working and traveling together. On press planes they hear the same stories and retell whatever juicy morsels of gossip they have heard recently. Press hotels, press buses, filing centers, poolside chats among journalists on the road with the president--all become an echo chamber of rumor upon hearsay upon possible story idea. And the reporters are constantly pushing sources for something, <i>anything,</i> that The Post or The Times or CNN does not have.</span></p> <p><span>Of course, everything gets checked out, and the process is arguably a healthy one that eventually separates the truth from the bullshit. But only eventually. In the meantime, even the fact that rumors are going around can become a story. Over pate and wine on the press plane (these ain't the scruffy boys on the bus anymore), you hear that Marilyn Quayle is sick. You call a couple Republican Party officials who heard Dan Quayle might be dropped. Bingo. Come filing time, you can write a fresh story.</span></p> <p><span>Or a more realistic example: Last Thursday, The Wall Street Journal ran a front-page story about the rumors that Quayle might get the axe. On his way out of the Journal's Washington bureau, the story's primary author was asked what he thought the chances were that Quayle would be dumped. \"A hundred to one,\" he said. The Journal ran the story anyway.</span></p> <p><span>Don't get me wrong. The journalists who cover the White House do a damn good job and print almost zero that is not confirmed by at least someone who ought to know. But because they are covering the president, their editors want something every day. After all, he is the president, and they are paying a huge sum to send their reporters out with him.</span></p> <p><span>But every day? This coverage includes days when the White House is the focal point of news (as with last Friday, when the Washington Post's chief White House reporter, Ann Devroy, wrote or co-wrote the three stories on the top half of Saturday's front page) as well as days when Bush does nothing but name a national Point of Light (his daily public service award; yesterday he named number 843 of the \"thousand\" he spoke about in 1988).</span></p> <p><span>On those boring days, the rumors can get their fullest hearing, simply because the journalists have nothing else to file. This is especially true when they confirm a story's subtext, just as the Quayle rumors confirmed that Bush's campaigning is sinking faster than the vice president's IQ scores.</span></p> <p><span>For instance, it was during a sleepy Bush vacation in Jackson Hole, Wy. that Campaign chair Robert Teeter and Chief of Staff Samuel K. Skinner were first asked about the Quayle rumors and the rumors that Bush is ill.</span></p> <p><span>IT'S NOT CLEAR that publishing or broadcasting rumors is all that destructive to democracy. Doing so can certainly spark interest that  might prompt some readers, viewers or listeners to learn more about the election. But that matters little, of course, if most of what's being reported has nothing to do with public policy.</span></p> <p><span>The best strategy is for the White House press and their editors to use better judgment about what is really newsworthy and what is written simply because it's the White House beat. Editors shouldn't expect something from that beat every day, no matter how good the TV shot of the White House in the background looks.</span></p> <p><span><i>Editorial Chair John A. Cloud '93 traveled with the White House Press Corps on President Bush's recent trips to Maine, California and Wyoming. Absolutely nothing happened.</i></span></p>"}
{"title": "A Tale of Two Stereotypes | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>HIS YEAR, the gaffes are frequently turned into the most memorable part of campaign speeches, often to the detriment of serious political dialogue. Who could forget Clinton's \"I didn't inhale\" or Bush's tribute to that famous country-western band, the \"Nitty Ditty Nitty Gritty Great Bird\"? Dan Quayle's little boo-boos already fill a book (<i>Quayle Hunting</i>). Perot was officially undone as soon as he called the NAACP \"you people.\"</span></p> <p><span>But all this is mainly material for political cartoonists and Jay Leno. Despite the media's tendency to jump on casual statements and treat them as the key to the speaker's character flaws, few blunderers have been so shamed by their own brief lapses of self-revelation that they changed their whole image.</span></p> <p><span>Hillary Rodham Clinton is the exception. Twice, she has expressed her resentment of stereotypical expectations of female subordination. And each time, her motivations have been ignored and she has been miscast as the one who promotes insensitive stereotypes. Her response to this has been to tone down her independent-woman persona and become more like June Cleaver than Murphy Brown.</span></p> <p><span>In order to counter the negative publicity generated by her \"I don't want to stay home and bake cookies\" comment, she initiated a bake-off with Barbara Bush and had Clinton campaign officials handing out \"Hillary's Cookies\" at the Democratic Convention. She further altered her image from career woman to domestic helpmate by changing her clothing style from business suits to more \"feminine\" pastel dresses. Earlier in her career, she used her maiden name instead of taking her husband's, but became \"Mrs. Clinton\" when her assertion of independence was viewed negatively by his constituents. Mrs. Clinton has spent a long time trying not to let the media turn her anger at women's restricted roles into a political liability.</span></p> <p><span>When her husband's fidelity was questioned, she stood by him, but distinguished herself from the traditional good little wife whose motto might be \"my husband right or wrong,\" by saying she wasn't going to be a \"Tammy Wynette 'Stand By Your Man'\" type of wife. The message: I'm here because I trust him, not because I'm a doormat.</span></p> <p><span>Mrs. Clinton could have been more tactful. Still, the media should have focused on the issues she was trying to raise--the meaning of fidelity, women's roles, and sexual morality in the 1990's as opposed to the 1950's--instead of on how insulted Ms. Wynette felt. Mrs. Clinton was only doing what all politicians do in an age of sound bites: use a cultural icon (like the typical country- western- song cheated 'n' mistreated patient wife) to make a point quickly and concisely.</span></p> <p><span>The same thing happened recently when Clinton said she wouldn't just \"stay home and bake cookies\" if her husband became president. This time she didn't risk offending anyone by mentioning names. June Cleaver's name never came up. But this strategy backfired too. Now <i>every</i> average cookie-baking homemaker in America has the right to feel insulted by Hillary's antipathy to family values and contempt for women without careers.</span></p> <p><span>If anyone took the trouble to try and understand her remarks and her rage, they'd realize Clinton's target wasn't cookie-baking moms but the people who wouldn't accept a First Lady unless she fit that image. Hillary Clinton sees no reason to apologize for her role as a political partner and adviser to her husband. It's a shame she has to defend herself at all.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>PPARENTLY, THOUGH, the old maxim still holds: a strong man is a leader, a strong woman is a bitch. Remember how relieved people were when \"domineering\" Nancy Reagan left the White House and soft, grandmotherly Barbara Bush moved in? We should have been grateful that though we were deluded enough to elect a president who thought trees caused pollution, we still had someone in the White House who had a brain and wasn't afraid to use it.</span></p> <p><span>The very qualities that we can accept in a female politician are the ones we condemn in politicians' wives. In political rhetoric, there's always a good guy (good gal?) and a bad one, an image of what the candidate wants to be and an image of what she rejects. But when Hillary Clinton speaks out to define herself in public, she has to hush up for fear of offending someone with her angry slogans. Is this concern for the cookie-bakers of America, or is it our fear of a woman who doesn't \"know her place\"?</span></p> <p><span>Mrs. Clinton didn't create the cultural atmosphere that plays off the two female stereotypes, homemaker and hard yuppie, against each other. She shouldn't be blamed for reinforcing this dichotomy when she was actually rebelling against its effects on her.</span></p> <p><span>The spectacle of Hillary Clinton switching from business suits to pastels and handling out cookies isn't cute. It's degrading. And it's a depressing reminder that we're not as progressive as we think we are, that we'd rather cut the brain power of the Clinton team by half than have a strong-willed and politically active First Lady. As Dan Quayle once said, what a waste it is to lose one's mind.</span></p>"}

{"title": "A Slice of Life | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>By the time I decided to apply here, I was hyper-conscious about the Harvard thing. I noticed the kids in malls with crimson veritas t-shirts and caught the ubiquitous references to the school in movies and sit-coms. I was also struck by the virulent rhetoric used by then-presidential candidate George Bush. Bush, furiously trying to dewimpify himself, had a line in his stump speech about \"Dukakis' Harvard liberals\" and their elitist agenda on the left.</span></p> <p><span>The former Skull and Bones member and son of a millionaire had a hard time convincing me of his populist mentality. But Bush's message was popular because he was preying on the pop-culture image of Harvard as a 350-year-old conspiracy against the ordinary person. \"You can always tell a Harvard man.\" read a sign on my Yale brother's door, \"but you can't tell him much.\"</span></p> <p><span>The image many people have of Harvard involves cocktail parties in New England estates, or a collection of famous faces: John F. Kennedy '40, T.S. Eliot '04, Norman Mailer '43. I think of it more like a Rorschach inkblot. If you look carefully, you can see those old-monied types with caviar and martinis. But in my little corner of the inkblot you're more likely to see slices of pizza and newspaper presses. I've not been plotting to take over the world in the last three years. I've just been learning how to survive--with as much style as I can muster.</span></p> <p><span>The first real character in my Harvard experience was my roommate Ashvin. Ashvin was born in India and moved to the States in the third grade. It must have been the enthusiasm of having met my first real friend at Harvard that inspired something I called <i>Ashvin of the Day: Part I...\"And on the seventh day,\" I wrote the second week of school, \"the Lord created Ashvin. And the Lord looked down and saw that Ashvin was good. And the Lord smiled upon Ashvin.\"</i> This started a series of messages that I posted each night on our entryway door. If Dwight, our proctor, noticed them, he never mentioned anything--he didn't talk much, that Dwight.</span></p> <p><span>Someone in Grays discovered Pinochio's and that great Eastern institution, the slice. We would congregate for pizza just after midnight and come home to work and, in my case, fritter away some more time. On day four, I wrote <i>\"Critics are raving about Ashvin.\"</i></span></p> <p><span><i>\"Ashvin is sophisticated and marvelously humane.\"</i> -New Yorker</span></p> <p><span><i>\"Raw Power. The American spirit defined. How do I get to Braintree?\"</i> \u00a0\u00a0Washington Post</span></p> <p><span><i>\"Funky. Very Funky. Funkiest guy in the dorm. Extremely funky.\"</i> \u00a0\u00a0-Jenny Mayher</span></p> <p><span>The daily series created a minor cult following in our dorm. I think people enjoyed the notes because they were so inexplicable--I certainly didn't have any explanation. My enthusiasm for college was tempered with some hard realities. I had a hard time with the work, didn't meet as many people as I wanted, etc. Charmaine and I remained distant friends and I began to get to know Jenny pretty well. But orientation week ended, and that easy familiarity with which a first-year could approach a stranger in the Union and strike up a conversation hardened into intense romances and newly-founded social cliques.</span></p> <p><span>Consider this. My second day here I <t>met Lauren in front of Matthews Hall. She had ablue bandana and was shining an apple. I assumedthat she was going to eat this apple but it turnedout Lauren just liked to shine apples. People atHarvard will surprise you like that. We had aconversation about becoming Friends of the FoggArt Museum. When I turned to leave she gave me theapple. I was hungry. It was fantastic.<p>Still, a few weeks into school it seemed thatmeeting people was increasingly a chore. So Icelebrated Ashvin. For a while, he was all I had.</p><p>In class I seemed to float from one lecture toanother, toughing out the papers and the labs.Still, the wisdom and enthusiasm of the professorswas astounding. I took E.O. Wilson's course onevolutionary biology. \"you know,\" he said during alecture on reproduction, \"each ejaculationproduces a hundred million or so sperm. you arethe product of a sperm that beat out millions ofothers--kind of like a genetic megabuck winner.\"</p><p>I made it through to winter break. All my highschool friends rushed to tell me how great schoolwas. I doubted that they were being completelyhonest with themselves. As far as I know no onehas first year free from emotional turbulence.</p><p>I should know. I was one of the \"great\" sayers.My first semester had been okay, nothing wrong,nothing truly fantastic. Spring semester was adifferent story.</p><p>It started with my Expository Writing course.Every first-year has to take Expos. For many it'sa nightmare, due to professors that are eitherincompetent, annoying or both. But since it's oneof the few courses at Harvard with a maximum classsize of ten or 12 students, it has a lot ofpotential. Landing Pat Hoy as a professor was justblind luck. Maybe everybody's first year isrevolutionized by pieces of luck like this, goodor bad.</p><p>In high school, I had an inspiring, thoughsomewhat twisted, English teacher who took meunder wing both to cultivate talent and to trip onpower. In any case, I left Cincinnati consideringmyself a writer. I had a few stories and essaysunder my belt and a pile of <i>Wyoming Horizon</i>newspapers. all fall, though, I wrote a total offive paper--only two of them were more than fivepages. I came to Pat's class with a lot ofbaggage--illusions warring with great trepidation.</p><p>The first assignments were nothing complicated,just short writing exercises to be built laterinto larger projects. I was supposed to look forsome image, some event or story that had whatVirginia Woolf called \"shocking power.\" What Icame up with was, well, nothing.</p><p>Next we were to find the idea behind thatimage--the simple truth that the image supportedas evidence. Then we were to write an essay. Ieventually wrote a stilted, halting piece aboutcommunicating with my dad. Looking back at thatpiece, I do see the seeds of somethinginteresting. But just the seeds.</p><p>Meanwhile, my roommate Christopher, who was taking Expos with another professor, showed me his first piece. Christopher is a computer science major with ambitions to study artificial intelligence. I was flattered when he asked me to read his work--itseemed he wanted my approval. Turns out he hadwritten the most fluid, mature, sensitive pieces Ihad seen in recent memory. And writing wasn't evenhis thing. That killed me.</p><p>Expos got worse. If I had trouble writing aboutmy dad, producing a critical essay on E.B. Whitewas a nightmare. By the time the third project wasdue, shortly before spring break, I experiencedenormous anxiety trying to describe my piece tothe rest of the class. As they sat looking at meuneasily, I began to cry.</p><p>This wasn't just the case of an overachieverhumbled by a tough college professor. I wasn'tconcerned in the slightest about grades. Reachingdeep inside myself for creative insight, I wasfinding only unexplored pain.</p><p>My first-year at Harvard wasn't my first brushwith emotional trouble. But until then, I'd justput off my anxieties, expecting the future wouldwork things out. When I broke down, my mom steppedin to nurture my confidence about the future. Weboth figured college would be a great place tostart. My high school class numbered about 120. Ihad friends, but few of them really related to myinner core. I thought that at Harvard I would meetpeople who would.</p><p>I was right. If there is one common threadamong undergraduates here, it's that our minds areworking non-stop--\"Like sixty\" as the <i>GreatBrain</i> books used to describe it. That mentalactivity isn't always concentrated on composingpoetry or theorizing on mathematical problems,though. A lot of it is obsessive and negative.Acute sensitivity to the rich pastiche of Life isa wonderful asset but it can also lead to a lot ofpain.</p><p>Fully understanding that paradox was shocking.It meant me and my mom were only partly right.Everything wasn't going to be just fine. Somethings would. Some wouldn't. And I was just goingto have to deal.</p><p>I was right in thinking that I'd meet new andexciting people. Bet I was wrong to think thatestablishing intimacy with such delicate andcomplex men and women would be easy. I've livedwith Ashvin for three years now and we've got onemore to go. That first year was only a tiny partof the development of our friendship. Happenedthat he had a girlfriend who demanded all of histime and went on psychotic rampages when heresisted. Jenny, too, had a boyfriend, although hewas quite sane. These people, and some others,would eventually bring me enormous comfort. But Ihad a ways to go before our relationships couldmature.</p><p>The weight of Expos and my other classes becamepretty overwhelming that spring. I rememberresearching a big history paper, absentmindedlywandering through the stacks of Widener, thenLamont, then the Law School library. I returnedhome with a stack of ten books--exhausted withanxiety, sure I could never put that knowledge towork for me.</p><p>It wasn't just the schoolwork, either. My suitewas not exactly conducive to broadening one'ssocial horizons. Christopher firmly believed inbeing asocial as a way of life, except when itcame to women. His high school girlfriend was alsoat Harvard and, until they started having troublelater in the fall, I barely knew who he was. Wecalled him the phantom roommate. Takashi mainlydid his own thing. and then there was Bigley. Kenwas a special case. he really struggled hisfirstyear--spent most of his time in the roomhunched over the desk, springing up to lookthrough the eyehole every time he heard somethingin the hall.</p><p>Ashvin, as I've said, was great. But there wasalways the evil girlfriend Navarra, looming in ourroom. The stories about her are worthy of severalvolumes alone. I think the best concerns the timeshe threw a fit after Ashvin resisted going to<i>both</i> nights of her four or five hour danceperformance, She came into our room, nodded to me,wrote a note on his desk and looked in his closetfor some clothes. I didn't think much of it--shedid that all the time. Turns out she wrote in thenote that she had \"cut to shreds the thing youlove most--your crew jacket.\" She was bluffingAsbyin laughing at the absurdity of the situationwhile he anguished over how to reconcile withNavarra, insisted that we all read the note.</p><p>I wanted out. My brother David, my most trustedconfidante through that whole year, brought meback to reality every time I called him in acrisis. School is a pressure cooker, he told me.Bailing out of Harvard was not going to be myelixir, but it couldn't hurt to go home, eat somehome-cooked apple pie and collect my thoughts, ifthat was what I wanted to do. One day after RobertKiely's English class, I got up to leave, stunnedby his eloquent lecture and, again, frustrated bymy inability to concentrate and utilize thiswealth of intellectual opportunity. I shuffled outwith Charmaine and, as we passed through the doorof Emerson 105 I told her I was going to get someapple pie.</p><p>\"Enjoy it,\" she said, I was not communicating my feelings very well.</p><p>Like any good writing teacher, pat didn't letme get off the hook by running away. Good writers,he insisted, engage their anxieties anddepression. Not by pouting, but by taking the painand trying to extrapolate a universal truth. hepushed me hard to write a third essay, and afourth, that finally satisfied me. All that year,I felt I was performing for my professors,roommates and friends while my troubles gnawed atmy insides. I learned that spring to fuse the twointo a cohesive, though complex and certainly notideal, whole. I wrote about suicide, hope and my\"beautiful friend\" Kathy.

{"title": "Top Headlines on a Fickle Campus | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Harvard students receive piles of publications at their doorsteps every day, most of them filled with stories and opinions on campus events and issues.</span></p> <p><span>The Harvard campus is fickle. Most of the time the publications go from doormat to trash can without a second thought. But sometimes, for some reason, the campus latches on to an issue and decides to consider it important. Then, the whole college is reading and writing, talking and sometimes listening.</span></p> <p><span>The funny thing about Harvard, and perhaps the world in general, is that one year an issue can be hot and the next year the same issue will be virtually ignored by the general student body--even if the powers that be continue to debate it.</span></p> <p><span>Last year's losing issue was ROTC, In 1989, students debated the issue in classes and dining halls. But the students body barely peeped this year when the issue returned to the Administration's front burner. The hot subjects last year or at least last semester, were Harvard Law School protests and campus race relations.</span></p> <p><span>The protests and discussions will continue. But the pundits can never be sure which issues have the staying power to excite and incite students for more than a semester.</span></p> <p><span><b>Law School</b></span></p> <p><span>One issue that is certain to survive is the debate over women and minority faculty hiring at Harvard Law school. Last spring, law students besieged their school with protests, rallies and sit-ins demanding that more women and people of color be represented on the faculty.</span></p> <p><span>The protests were driven by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court's decision to hear arguments about whether the Law School's Coalition for Civil Rights--a student group composed of six minority organizations and the Women's Law Association--had the standing to sue the University for alleged discriminatory hiring practices.</span></p> <p><span>If the Court this summer rules in the students' favor, the school will again be the site of protests and rallies.</span></p> <p><span><b>Race Relations</b></span></p> <p><span>Race Relations will surely top this semester's agenda, as well. Dean of students Archie C. Epps III has been recently appointed to coordinate the actions of the Colleges' two race relations offices, the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations and the Office of Race Relations and Minority Affairs.</span></p> <p><span>Epps' appointment comes after a semester of tensions. In April, the director of the Harvard Foundation, S. Allen Counter, wrote a letter to The Crimson accusing the newspaper of bias in its reporting of minority issues.</span></p> <p><span>In the letter, Counter accused The Crimson of directing news and editorial content toward an \"agenda\" aligned with Jewish students who frequent Harvard Hillel. Those remarks and others in Counter's letter drew the ire of many Jewish student.</span></p> <p><span>An angry response to Counter's letter on the editorial page of The Crimson upset minority groups, which rallied to Counter and the Foundation's side.</span></p> <p><span>The Black Students Association doordropped a leaflet accusing the Harvard police, the conservative campus magazine <i>Peninsula,</i> Harvard Law School and The Crimson of insensitivity toward Black students.</span></p> <p><span>Epps is planning a retreat for student leaders in the fall, and student organizations involved in last semester's controversy have pledged to continue to meet.

{"title": "Shady Elements | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>W</b>ASHINGTON, D.C.--\"They can fight with each other from now till November as far as I'm concerned,\" Bill Clinton said of Ross Perot and George Bush last week. He was trying his hardest--at least for once--to stay out of the political slime-slinging, although NBC News reported that his advisers had been phoning reporters to point out negative stories about Perot.</span></p> <p><span>The Official Clinton campaign Line is that while the two good ol' boys were fighting the geek with a policy was talking issues with his new economic plan, called \"Putting People First.\" As Democratic consultant Tony Podesta put it, \"the news about Clinton is substantive and future-oriented--and about the others guys, it's about shady transactions.\"</span></p> <p><span>But Clinton's new plan, while clearly better for the country than Bush's tired gaggle of capital gains tax cuts and Perot's empty posturing, contains some shady elements of its own. Most disturbing, perhaps, was Clinton's attack on foreign investment in U.S. companies. Under Clinton's plan, Washington would tax that investment by between $9 billion and $13.5 billion a year for an increase of what he hopes is $45 billion over four years.</span></p> <p><span>The foreign investment tax is part of a larger revenue-swelling program involving a 10 percent marginal tax hike on the wealthy and some cost-cutting--all in the hopes of slicing the budget deficit in half during his first term. Much of the plan is exactly what America needs: to move away from the borrow-and-spend Reagan-Bush years; to rebuild crumbling roads, bridges and other elements of the infrastructure; to provide tax credits for new investment, small businesses and research and development.</span></p> <p><span>These programs, along with his plans for education and urban renewal, will begin to reverse the disaster of the last decade. But the foreign investment part of the plan is just plain wrong.</span></p> <p><span><b>F</b>oreign investors' dollars sustained an otherwise declining capital pool during the 1980s. The U.S. can--and has--used those dollars to invest in its own companies, increasing its productivity and, ultimately, its wages. All of this is basic Ec 10. So why is Clinton targeting foreign investment?</span></p> <p><span>Because when you're running for office, you have to hunt where the ducks are. And the ducks believe foreign investment hurts America. One 1990 poll revealed that 86 percent of those Americans surveyed said they would rather see slower growth in both Japan and U.S. and than faster growth in both countries with Japan in the lead.</span></p> <p><span>And 75 percent of the respondents in a 1989 poll said they favored limitations on the level of foreign investment in the U.S. In a separate 1989 poll, only 10 percent of those questioned said they want to encourage Japanese investment.</span></p> <p><span>Many economic observers and politicians fuel these beliefs by charging that foreigners invest in American companies--particularly high-tech, high-profit companies--and then ship either the jobs or the technology overseas, depending on how devious they are. Most of the jobs apparently come from bread-and-butter industries like auto-building. Most of the technology apparently comes from the electronics or weapons industry.</span></p> <p><span>Clinton is not alone in highlighting concerns. Last week, the Investigations Subcommittee of the House Armed Service Committee held hearings on the proposed sale of the missiles and aircraft divisions of Texas's LTV Aerospace and Defense Company to a couple of companies controlled at least partially by the French government.</span></p> <p><span>Some committee members worry that the French will gain access to American missile technology of the sale goes through. Admittedly, this should generate some uneasiness. The French might well use this knowledge to build advanced weapons and sell them to Third World nations like Libya. Keeping the technology secret keeps such weapons from some of the world's nut cases.</span></p> <p><span>But others are using the proposed sale to ignite unnecessary fear that we are selling off our security--to the French, of all people. During the hearing, Rep. Joel M. Hefley (R-Col.) actually said. \"We are not dealing with a friend country here. We're dealing with a <i>friendly</i> country, but even though we've saved their bacon time again, they have not always been a friend.\"</span></p> <p><span>The potential for demagoguery on this issue is huge. Again and again, high-profile foreign investment cases spark new rounds of foreigner-bashing that all too often teeter on the edge of racism. Previous cases such as the sale of the Rockefeller Center to Japanese real estate moguls and the more recent purchase of the Seattle Mariners by Japanese investors come to mind.</span></p> <p><span>But the figures tossed about in these debates over foreign investment are usually wildly overstated--or, more often, quietly overlooked. The Commerce Department reported last week that in 1987, foreignowned U.S. companies employed just 3.7 percent of the American work force and paid only 4.7 percent of Americans' wages.</span></p> <p><span>The rest was all American. And the Commerce Department defines \"foreign-owned\" as \"a U.S. business that is owned 10 percent or more by a foreign investor.\" By this absurd measure, companies with almost no foreign control are defined as \"foreign-owned.\"</span></p> <p><span>In 1987, for the first time ever, the Commerce department broke down the foreign investments by specific industry. The figures indicate clearly that foreign investors do not specifically target high-tech American firms. Levels of foreign investment in these firms were relatively high, but the levels were also high in some low-tech, mundane industries.</span></p> <p><span>For example, the industry in which foreigners employed the largest percentage of American workers (61.2 percent) was cement manufacturing. By comparison, only 39.7 percent of American workers in household audio and video equipment manufacturing worked for foreign-owned companies. Foreigners do control 12.5 percent of the sales in electronics manufacturing, but they also control 16.8 percent of the sales in mining.</span></p> <p><span>The point is, foreign investors make no broad attempt to target one segment of the American economy. Like all investors, they seek to make money wherever they can.</span></p> <p><span>Finally, the statistics reveal that Japan is less involved in the American economy than the Japan-bashers charge. The <i>rate</i> of growth in investment in U.S. companies was higher for Japan than for other nations from 1979 to 1988. But in 1987, Japan's share of American industry was less than half of Britain's and only slightly larger than the Netherlands'.</span></p> <p><span><b>O</b>f course, Americans should not use foreign dollars as am investment crutch that allows them to consume more and invest less. This is precisely what happened during the Reagan years, and Clinton wants to fix it. But the answer cannot be to punish foreign investors. Instead, we should concentrate on another element of the Clinton plan: providing tax credits for Americans to invest in U.S. companies.</span></p> <p><span>Clinton says he is simply trying to \"prevent tax avoidance by foreign corporations.\" He couches his tax increase on foreign investors as a plan to begin collecting taxes foreigners have been avoiding for years. But the net effect is still an increase in the real tax burden for these investors. And anyway, many economists deny that foreigners have been cheating as much as Clinton charges.</span></p> <p><span>We probably shouldn't be too hard on the governor. After all, he's the only one who's found the wherewithal to release an economic plan. And this is not intended to echo the charge that Clinton merely panders to voters according to poll numbers. His willingness to anger some of his most dependable voters--however calculated it may be--should be enough to dismiss the idea.</span></p> <p><span>But in this case, Clinton has let the tendency to foreigner-bash influence an otherwise solid plan. He would be better to leave the xenophobic idiot vote to Ross Perot, who will win it anyway.</span></p> <p><span><i>Editorial Chair John A.

{"title": "What the Heck is This Dilbert? A Neophyte's Guide to the Funnies | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>When mild mannered classical archaeology concentrator David Rogers '92 left Harvard, and took his high-caliber comic strip \"Dim Wits\" along with him, The crimson had to fill the void with several syndicated strips. Although it was high praise for Rogers that his strip could only be replaced with several professional ones, many readers were confronted with a serious question. \"What the heck is this Dilbert?\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Dilbert\" needs to grow on the reader. upon first introduction to Scott Adams' strip about an inept scientist/bureaucrat and his fiendish canine, one might find the artwork too primitive, and the dog to be just too darn cruel. however, one soon realizes that the artworks is more stylistic than crude-the strip works partly because of its uniquely flat look. In addition, one starts to actually like the megalomaniacal mutt, Dogbert, and his some time sick sense of humor.</span></p> <p><span>Dilbert is nothing more than a pathetic stooge. It's the scheming dog, and Dilbert's cruel co-workers that often provide the jokes at Dilbert's expense.</span></p> <p><span>The current storyline about a clearly fraudulent \"investment advisor\" seems to be pretty good although Dilbert's alter ego, Dogbert, and his School of Common Sense for truly stupid people are nowhere to be found. What's funnier is that although Dilbert recognizes that to give his money to this guy is the equivalent of \"flinging\" his hard earned cash \"out the window,\" he will probably invest with this guy anyway, just as he always asks out women who will inevitably humiliate him in some excruciatingly painful fashion.</span></p> <p><span>Is sum, Dilbert, despite all his brainpower, is a hapless fool. Good strip, though.</span></p> <p><span>Another recent addition is Mike Peters' \"Mother Goose and Grimm.\" Peter is a solid cartoonist known not only for this strip, but also for his work as a political cartoonist, often seen on the Perspectives page of Newsweek. Although he is not the greatest talent ever to grace to medium, he produces consistently good work, despite being occassionally tasteless, in both his daily and his political cartoons.</span></p> <p><span>Grimm, the rather deranged Old Yeller (I'm referring to the pre-rabies Yeller of course) has done one too many \"fire hydrant\" jokes for my tastes, but he's weird enough to like. The strip alternates between one shot gags and storylines, the one shot gags often being funnier. A recent \"Soup of the Day joke\" involving some confusion between they day (Wednesday) and the soup, was stupid, but funny, which is perhaps a good way to summarize the strip.</span></p> <p><span>The third addition to The Crimson is Jeff MacNelly's \"Shoe.\" MacNelly's a Pulitzer Prize winner, is really much more at home with political cartooning. Shoe, his daily strip about a community of journalists living in the trees (they're birds) was at its best when he started it a number of years ago, and now has settled into a \"better than average state,\" One wonders if MacNelly does this syndicated strip more for the daily cash than anything else: as good as the strips is (it's usually worth at least a chuckle) his political work is much better. Though his work is consistently above average, it still does not live up to his potential. Perhaps this is why Shoe, although a current mainstay of the industry, does not enjoy the Widespread popularity of other strips such as \"Calvin and Hobbes.\" How imaginative can one be with a bunch of crusty old birds? At least, there are some brains behind this strip, which make it a decent choice for The Crimson, as opposed to say, Dennis the Menace or Marmaduke. Unfortunately, the strip doesn't seem to have much a of a storyline, other than running jokes about Roz's restaurant, the Professor's messy desk, or his nephew's poor performance in school.</span></p> <p><span>A mainstay of The Crimson is the classic comic strip, \"Doonesbury,\" by Gerry Trudeau. Despite the fact that he went to Yale, Trudeau is an artist who is remarkably sensitive to the pulse of our society. This is why Doonesbury will often be found on the nation's editorial pages as opposed to the comics pages, a sign that Doonesbury's work is lightyears ahead of the inanities of Jim Davis' Garfield.</span></p> <p><span>Trudeau, Through his cash of well-developed characters, has dealt with the issues on the American scene for about two decades. He has centered storylines on the conflict in Vietnam, to AIDS related death on a character, something that no other popular cartoonist has ever been able to do.</span></p> <p><span>Furthermore, no one has been able to capture the essence of and crush public figures like Trudeau. In Doonesbury, he doesn't bother to draw actual portraits of prominent politicians. Instead, he reduces them economically and hilariously to talking symbols, conveying their characters with just a few strokes of the pen. Dan Quayle is nothing but a talking feather; George Bush a Few symmetrical lines floating in the air and David Duke a talking swastika.</span></p> <p><span>A recent story line reflects some of the strips lighter humor. Boopsie, the airhead actress has been telling a charming, yet typical tale of all her reincarnations from \"a plague-stricken calligrapher... from Gunbad-i-Qabus\" to a victim of headhunters in the Malaysian Archipelago. From the highly political to the highly bizarre, Trudeau's Doonesbury is always entertaining and is definitely one of the best strips running in newspapers today.</span></p> <p><span>Bill Watterson's \"Calvin and Hobbes\" is a pure joy to read. This is quite ironic considering that the title characters are named after two philosophers who had rather bleak views of human nature. The adventures of mischievous and precocious six years-old Calvin and his quiet, reflective, stuffed tiger Hobbes a not only capture a child-like sense of fun and adventure, but also at times see as social commentary. Watterson's recent leave of absence is understandable give his wonderful consistency. It must be imaginatively exhausting to continually come up with stuff this entertaining. Perhaps the strip isn't s sophisticated as Doonesbury, but that doesn't matter. Calvin and Hobbes is the best strip around.</span></p> <p><span>The recent stroyline about art and whether it should by produced for its sales value or for its own sake was quite entertaining. Hobbes, the idealist made a lovely clay tiger. Calvin the cynic, took his play-doh and produced a hundred shrunken heads of popular cartoon characters\" and \"stitched their mouths shut.\" Sick, but funny.</span></p> <p><span>Now Calvin is dealing with the fact that he saw disturbing omen in the sky of late...his own face in the clouds, sticking its tongue out at him. Calvin however, in another telling reflection of our society's emphasis on science and fact, at the expense of fantasy, merely sees this as being a sing of \"very peculiar high altitude winds,\" and doesn't worry.</span></p> <p><span>As funny as the strip is now, it's not quite at the creative level it was during the days of the cardbrod transmogrifier/time machine, or the mutant snowmen that came to life. Still, the strip is top notch.</span></p> <p><span>And, although not all of the strips are currently living up to their potential, they're Still a fine selection of the industry's talent, each black and white gems of sequential art worthy of replacing the home grow Dim Wits.</span></p>"}

They said the act \"will help insure, through our financial aid practices, that a college education at our institution remains accessible to the maximum possible number of needy student.\"</span></p> <p><span>The act also included changes making more federal financial aid available. It makes Pell Grants available to families that would not have qualified before, and it also greatly increases the availability of student loans.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard students currently receive $35 million in federal loans each year.</span></p> <p><span>The act's impact on the bidding wars which recently began between Ivy League colleges vying for desirable students is still unclear.</span></p> <p><span>College officials say the bidding wars are the result of their agreement last spring to stop sharing financial aid information. The Department of Justice maintained the cooperation, known as \"overlap\" violated antitrust laws, and the colleges ceased sharing information in exchange for the Justice Department dropping a lawsuit against them. The colleges had defended the practice because they said it kept money from becoming a factor in college choice .</span></p> <p><span>The statement from the Ivy League president said, \"Our universities have long agreed to award our own financial aid funds to undergraduates only on the basis of demonstrated financial need. Last year we were obliged to suspend this agreement because the Department of Justice disputed its legality under the anti-trust laws. Now that the Higher Education Reauthorization Act has been signed into law, we plan to resume our financial aid agreement in the manner authorized by the new statute.\"</span></p> <p><span>But the agreement limits the extent to which the institutions can cooperate.</span></p> <p><span>\"They don't tell in the press release that [the act] explicitly forbids them from going back to doing what got them sued,\" said one Democratic Senate staff members who worked on the 411 page, $115 billion piece of legislation .</span></p> <p><span>In fact, the act says colleges cannot \"discuss or agree with each other on the prospective financial aid award to a specific common applicant for financial aid.\" Until 1991, representatives of the schools met annually to discuss specifically financial aid packages for individual students.

They took on Hitler in 1939, two years before Pearl Harbor woke this country up.</span></p> <p><span>That's heady stuff. But it's also old stuff. Of more recent interest is the Brits' behavior at the voting booth since 1979.</span></p> <p><span>That's when they catapulted Maggie Thatcher and her Conservative Party to a parliamentary majority in 1979, one year before Americans elected Ronald Reagan president. And while the Brits went for Thatcher twice-more over the next decade, we Americans followed them by re-electing Reagan in 1984 and then Bush in 1988.</span></p> <p><span>And just last Thursday, they went for the Conservatives for the fourth straight election, keeping 10 Downing Street the home of Prime Minister John Major, Thatcher's successor as the Conservative Party leader.</span></p> <p><span>By George, Bill Clinton should be shitting in his britches.</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>ITH BRITAIN mired in its biggest recession since the 1930s, the big election debate in 1992 centered on taxes and health care.</span></p> <p><span>Neil Kinnock, leader of the Labor party, promised to increase public services by raising tax rates on the wealthy and to undo the Conservatives small market-oriented reforms in the National Health service. Major, on the other hand, told voters that Labor's proposed tax increase would inflict further damage on the economy and defended his government's health policies.</span></p> <p><span>And while Britain's position on European integration had been the focus of much debate in recent years, foreign policy issues were hardly discussed in this year's campaign at all.</span></p> <p><span>There was also the personal factor in the election. While personality was probably not as important as substantive economic issues, voters found Major dull though inoffensive, compared to the flamboyant Thatcher who had led the Conservatives to their past three election victories.</span></p> <p><span>More importantly, though, voters were somewhat uncomfortable with Kinnock, who had in the 1980s led a party that advocated more radical left-wing positions--like hefty tax increases, nationalization of industries and unilateral nuclear disarmament--than it did this year.</span></p> <p><span>And when the fat lady finally sang, the Conservatives got 336 seats and Labor 271 in the 651-member parliament. A handful of smaller parties took 25 seats between them.</span></p> <p><span>In a post-election New York Times editorial, Anthony Lewis called Kinnock's record \"historical baggage,\" writing that \"perhaps it will just take time, and a new party leader to giver Labor the modern look of a European social democratic party.\"</span></p> <p><span>The only other party that has a significant delegation in Parliament is the Liberal Democrats, who have 18 Members of Parliament. They actually received 18 percent of the popular vote, but Britain's electoral system, like America's, is not proportional. The top vote-getter in each district gets the seat in parliament.</span></p> <p><span>The bottom line, of course, is that the Conservatives got another 5-year mandate from British voters.</span></p> <p><span><b>S</b>OUND FAMILIAR?</span></p> <p><span>There's no question that the U.S. is in a recession. And there's precious little talk about foreign policy in this year's primary season, despite historic changes in the world and America's role in it over the last several years.</span></p> <p><span>In terms of policy, Bill Clinton, who calls for a more active government than Reagan and Bush have, sounds at least a little like Kinnock (though not as much as Joe Biden did in 1988).</span></p> <p><span>George Bush, meanwhile, is playing Major's role, trying to convince the public that the economy is recovering and defending the status quo legacy of his more charismatic predecessor.</span></p> <p><span>In terms of personality, Clinton has a flowering reputation as the \"scandal-a-week\" candidate. Bush, like Major, is dull but inoffensive.</span></p> <p><span>And let's not forget that billionaire H. Ross Perot could play the third-party foil in November, perhaps skimming votes from Clinton and preventing him from winning majorities in key states.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE CASE, of course, should not be overstated. At least not too much. There are important differences.</span></p> <p><span>While Kinnock would have raised taxes on the middle class, Clinton offers tax cuts. And where Kinnock calls for expanding a nationalized health system, Clinton favors a much more conservative plan which would broaden employers' burdens for providing employee health care.</span></p> <p><span>And while questions of Kinnock's judgement stemmed form past political blunders, Clinton's come from largely unsubstantiated allegations about improper personal behavior. (The British aren't as puritan as we are. When it came out last month that Paddy Ashdown, the liberal Democratic leader, had committed adultery, his popularity ratings actually swelled.)</span></p> <p><span>But the similarities between the two 1992 elections are striking. That's unfortunate for American.</span></p> <p><span>Because while the British have sent a lot of good things to this side of the Atlantic over the past 500 years, we should remember that they've sent some bad ones, too--like the Redcoats at Lexington, the war of 1812 and Canada, among other things.</span></p> <p><span>And a precedent that calls for four more years of George Bush would certainly be one of the worst.</span></p>"}

As he drank in the flavor the orange pekoe and contemplated the meaning of life, he would have appreciated the pearl of wisdom on the back of those unassuming red octagons.</span></p> <p><span>After all, who could fail to be inspired by lines like \"If you don't try, you can't fail\" or \"Your thoughts can't soar if you think like a turkey.\" Certainly it is not possible to resist the wit behind such zingers as \"apartment hunting...scouring for a pad\" or \"Shakespeare ode much to publishers,\" And even the greatest literature cannot match such insights into the humanity as \"Laughter is the shock absorber of life's blows\" or \"No one is a failure who is enjoying life.\"</span></p> <p><span>These pithy maxims and precepts represent nothing less than the distilled wisdom of the ages, a Ten (Thousand) Commandments for a generation of tea drinkers. Surely such wisdom can only come from someone who spends his life in constant meditation, carving his maxims into stone tablets and passing them on to his disciples to disseminate in the form of Tag Lines--the wise, bearded Salada man.</span></p> <p><span>Alas, there is no Salada Claus. The real gurus are a bunch of ordinary Joes like Salada employees and humor writers and occasionally even (Gasp)! advertising agencies.</span></p> <p><span>Just imagine--slick, unscrupulous admen coming up with the lines in between shots at their mini-basketball net [\"Hey Michael, how about this one: `Smart golfers never play through without a tea.' (Swish) \"sounds great, Elliot! Whaddaya' think about `if you need to get somewhere, take the Tea.' (Swish)].</span></p> <p><span>The good folks at Salada, however, maintain that the saying serve a higher purpose. Although the Tag Lines were the brainchild of a Salada ad man--one John W. Colpitts in 1962--the purpose behind them has never been a \"commercial one, but mainly one of public service,\" according to Gerry J. Doutre, the president of the company that owns Salada. The idea behind the Tag Lines is to the give tea drinkers \"something to do while you dangle,\" as an old advertising campaign ran.</span></p> <p><span>But there is no doubt that Salada takes their saying the seriously. A Salada promotional brochure from the 1960s reads: \"The sayings fall into the categories of Witty, Philosophical, Inspirational, and Humorous; many are Maxims for Daily Living in Brief Form [MDLBFs, of course], while some are really Home Truths which Really `Hit the Nail On The Head' [HTWRHTNOTHs, for those in the know].\"</span></p> <p><span>The categories give rise to great debates such as whether the observation that \"a successful supervisor knows how to delegate the blame\" is a HTWRHTNOTH or a MDLBF.</span></p> <p><span>Salada researchers discovered that in the 1950s tea drinker had begun brewing tea right in the cup instead of in teapots. The idea of giving customers something to do while their tea steeped fit well with Salada's claim that theirs was the \"world's slowest teabag,\" the assumption being that the longer the steeping takes, the better the flavor.</span></p> <p><span>According to Doutre, a particularly successful advertising campaign in the midsixties recounted the plight of the mythical American Federation of Gypsies as they sought in vain to get Salada to stop putting fortunes on their tea bags. As the story in the ad went, the Tag Lines were driving the gypsies out of business.</span></p> <p><span>The five-and-a-half minute-long radio commercial described the picketing activities of the Salada factory, which was then located in Woburn, and invited listeners to listen to the \"heart-rending tale of the gypsies,\" No \"War of the Worlds,\" but a fine fabrication nonetheless.</span></p> <p><span>Today, there are 195 Tag Lines in circulation, although the company hasused well over 2,000 different saying since their introduction in 1962.</span></p> <p><span>The supply is periodically replenished by write-in contests and the efforts of various adverstising agencies, although some are direct quotes from famous people (four from Benjamin Franklin, one each from Confucius, Thomas Edison and Ralph Waldo Emerson).</span></p> <p><span>Doutre says that the current purpose of the Tag Lines is \"to provide pithy, cogent comments on today's living conditions, not be controversial or political.\" He admits, however, that his company receives periodic complaints about certain Tag Lines, particularly those that concern lawyers.</span></p> <p><span>\"Every once in a while, we'll get a letter or a call saying `No, we don't exactly agree with that.' It's happened a couple of times with the ones about lawyers,\" says Doutre. Perhaps the attorneys in the Kalahari felt they were being defamed by the charge that \"verbose tribal lawyers beat around the bush.\"</span></p> <p><span>Indeed, today's Tag Lines seem to lack the inspirational quality of their ancestors. Among the original batch, the Tag Lines carried instructive messages like \"Great men never fell great, small men never feel small,\" and \"The opportunity of a lifetime is seldom so labelled.\"</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps it's emblematic of our society that today's Tag Lines seem much more concerned with being clever (\"When you tease someone under a pine tree, you needle them\") and cynical (\"A woman who tells her weight has nothing to lose\") than with promoting moral righteousness and responsibility (\"When the wells dry, we know the worth of water\").</span></p> <p><span>Maybe what we need to get this country back on track are some better Salada Tag Lines. Tag lines like they had in the sixties, when John F. Kennedy asked Americans to make sacrifices for their country. Maybe what President Bush and Governor Clinton should be doing is drinking more tea.</span></p> <p><span>Or maybe what we really need is for the wise, bearded Salada man to come down from his mountaintop and run for the president.</span></p>"}

Roughly 15 percent of the population has plan no medical insurance, and that number is expected to increase, as medical costs continue to take up a larger and larger proportion of disposable income.</span></p> <p><span>Faculty members and officials at Harvard Medical School and the School of Public Health declined this week to state personal opinions on the candidates' health care proposals. But several said they believe that health care reform will be one of the most pressing issues faced by the next administration.</span></p> <p><span>\"We have the highest health care costs and the least number of insured citizens of any industrialized country,\" said Dr. Robert J. Blendon, professor of Health policy and management at the Harvard School of Public Health. \"In other industrialized nations there is no such thing as an uninsured' citizen.\"</span></p> <p><span>Medical School Dean Daniel C. Tosteson '44 said that the high costs of health care are of increasing concern to the organizations that pay for most Americans' insurance, namely employers.</span></p> <p><span>\"Faced with health care bills that are increasing greater than inflation, [employers] are determined to contain these costs,\" Tosteson said.</span></p> <p><span>Though he said he believes it is crucial that everyone have the necessary access to health care, Tosteson noted that unwillingness to support health care for members of the lower income tax bracket is what destroyed earlier plans for national health care.</span></p> <p><span>\"[Equal access to health care] was the intent of the Medicare and Medicaid programs when they began in the 60s\" Tosteson said. \"Taxpayers of the nation balked at contributing taxes to support programs to provide care.\"</span></p> <p><span>The four major candidates currently running for president agree that the U.S. health care system needs to change. But they are far from unanimous in their ideas about what kind of changes should be pursued.</span></p> <p><span><b>BUSH: TAX CREDITS</b></span></p> <p><span>Last February, President Bush forwarded a health care plan intended to aid the 36 million Americans who are uninsured. The plan, now incorporated into his campaign platform, centers on providing tax credits to offset health care costs.</span></p> <p><span>Under the Bush plan, families below the poverty line could receive either a voucher or a credit subtracted from their tax bill. Families with a total yearly income of less than $70,000 would be able to deduct up to $3750 of taxable income for health care or unreimbursed medical bills.</span></p> <p><span><b>BUCHANAN: INCENTIVES</b></span></p> <p><span>Of the candidates, conservative columnist Patrick J. Buchanan has the least detailed plan. Buchanan's plan is similar to Bush's in that he supports the establishment of incentives for employers and individuals who purchase insurance.</span></p> <p><span>Buchanan also favors halting new Medicare regulations, and would issue vouchers to families to help pay the costs of long-term care of the elderly.</span></p> <p><span><b>BROWN: NATL. INSURANCE</b></span></p> <p><span>Democrat Edmund G. Brown Jr. is proposing the most drastic changes in American health care. Brown, the former governor of California, is calling for a system of national insurance similar to that of Canada.</span></p> <p><span>In this system the 1500 private health insurance and public health care plans currently operating would be replaced with a single national insurance program. The program would establish set fees for doctors, hospitals and medical procedures, and would give everyone equal access to these services.</span></p> <p><span>Brown also proposes increasing funding for \"wellness and prevention\" programs.</span></p> <p><span><b>CLINTON: 'PAY OR PLAY'</b></span></p> <p><span>Combining the private and public health care policies supported by the other candidates, Democrat Bill Clinton has come up with a \"pay or play\" model of health care. In Clinton's model, everyone would be covered either by private insurance plans provided through their employers--pay--or by a public program serving those who are uninsured or covered only by Medicaid--play.

{"title": "The Many Lives of Jerry Brown | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>\"What we need,\" Jerry Brown liked to say when he was young, \"is a flexible plan for an ever-changing world.\"</span></p> <p><span>Flexible he is. In fact, the former California governor who is now doggedly nipping at the heels of Bill Clinton, frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination, has been called downright elastic.</span></p> <p><span>These days, Brown is the outsider--pitching himself as the vessel of the next great populist movement. He moralizes on the evils of monied interest and accepts no donation larger than $100.</span></p> <p><span>And in his effort to stay close to the people, Brown repeatedly urges calls to his toll-free information number.</span></p> <p><span>800-426-1112, Jerry Brown practically has it tattooed on his forehead.</span></p> <p><span>But Brown hasn't always been a populist. Ever obedient to his creed of flexibility, he has at times defined himself as heir to his father's political throne, as dreamer, environmentalist, rock 'n' roller, pragmatist and technocrat.</span></p> <p><span>In fact, those who know Brown best say the former governor has reinvented himself more times than any Californian politician since Richard Nixon.</span></p> <p><span><b>THE BROWN PRINCE</b></span></p> <p><span>Although his father, Edmund G. \"Pat\" Brown, had been governor of California from 1959 to 1967, Edmund G. Brown Jr. had little inclination towards politics when he was young.</span></p> <p><span>When he grew up, the young Brown wanted to be a Jesuit priest.</span></p> <p><span>The religion thing at the Sacred Heart Novitiate, though, only lasted three years. At that point, Brown quit the seminary and enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley.</span></p> <p><span>There, he kept a low profile for three semesters. But the budding politician still had a sense of who he was.</span></p> <p><span>Asked by a good friend how he was able to enroll in Berkeley so quickly, Brown answered, \"Are you kidding? My father owns the university.\"</span></p> <p><span>After graduating from college in 1961 and then Yale Law School three years later. Brown lived the life of a liberal activist. he traveled around the South observing the civil rights movement and helped organize the coalition of Vietnam doves that backed former Minnesota Sen. Eugene J. McCarthy in the 1968 presidential election.</span></p> <p><span>But when he decided to run for public office, the idealistic Brown did not hesitate to trade on his father's established political name.</span></p> <p><span><b>THE GUV</b></span></p> <p><span>Known to everyone as Jerry, Brown went on the 1970 California ballot as \"Edmund G. Brown Jr.\"</span></p> <p><span>Many voters did not care about the \"Jr.\", and Brown took the race for secretary of state even as Republican Gov. Ronald Reagan swept to a decisive re-election victory.</span></p> <p><span>Ironically, Brown's ambitions then led him away from Pat Brown's old style politics.</span></p> <p><span>Running for governor in 1974, he cast himself in the role of the outsider, rejecting state lobbyists and special interest that were essential to his father's administration.</span></p> <p><span>Only 36 when he was elected, Brown quickly charmed Californians, cultivating a reputation as an energetic but easygoing leader--with a record 87 percent approval rating.</span></p> <p><span>But behind the scenes, Brown was anything but easygoing. His style of micromanagement put Jimmy Carter to shame.</span></p> <p><span>The long hours that Brown required of his staffers also took their toll. Carl Werthman, a special assistant to Brown, had a heart attack. Tom Hickey, who had been Pat Brown's travel secretary for two years, developed pneumonia and hepatitis after less than six months as an aide to the younger Brown. David Jensen, a press aide, developed an ulcer.</span></p> <p><span>All three men, according to Robert Pack's biography of Brown, were in their 30s and in good health before they went to work for the governor.</span></p> <p><span>Brown <i>was</i> firm in his public position on corruption. Like any politician he said he opposed it. But unlike most, he took dramatic steps.</span></p> <p><span>Brown's office would not accept gifts. And, foreshadowing the populist impulse that defines Brown in 1992, he refused to live in the governor's mansion built by Reagan, instead opting to sleep on a mattress on the floor of a state-owned apartment.</span></p> <p><span>\"We find a dramatic difference in that living in the apartment costs $22,000 a year,\" Brown said in 1976. \"Living in the new mansion will cost $391,000 a year--for a grand total of $1,476,000, which will save enough money to build a new mansion if the next governor would care to have two off them.\"</span></p> <p><span>With this virtually unblemished reputation, Brown decided to take his flexible persona to the big show. Against the advice of friends and advisers, he made a bid for the presidency in 1976.</span></p> <p><span>The 1976 Democratic race was not unlike the 1992 version. Jimmy Carter, a southern governor with only lukewarm support in the North, was winning votes but not much loyalty.</span></p> <p><span>Eschewing his gubernatorial record and instead running on a platform of environmentalism and space exploration (hence the nickname \"Moonbeam\"), Brown presented himself as the alternative to Carter and won five late primaries--Maryland, New Jersey, Nevada, Rhode Island and California.</span></p> <p><span>Brown embarrassed Carter in the California race, trouncing him by 39 percentage points, but left the party convention empty handed.</span></p> <p><span><b>THE ROCK 'N' ROLL YEARS</b></span></p> <p><span>Despite his family's wealth and power, Brown was unfamiliar with the high life that he was confronted with upon returning home with status near a Hollywood celebrity.</span></p> <p><span>The would-be Jesuit priest was now all the rage. He dated Linda Ronstadt (his only public romance so far) and began a life-long custom of throwing big-name parties.</span></p> <p><span>In his '92 race, in fact, Brown has racked up endorsements from stars like Graham Nash, David Crosby, Tim Nash and Carol O'Connor and has appeared on stage with the B-52's.</span></p> <p><span>But the wheels soon came off the bandwagon.</span></p> <p><span>For some Californians, Proposition 13, a landmark tax-cutting initiative, destroyed the perception that Brown was a man of his word. Brown opposed the measure vigorously, but when it passed overwhelmingly in June 1978, the governor did an about-face.</span></p> <p><span>\"He was personally opposed to Prop 13, but the day after it passed he got on the national news, saying how great it was, how he would enforce it,\" says Mark J. DiCamillo '75, a California polling executive.</span></p> <p><span>Brown was re-elected in 1978, but many Californians had lost confidence in the governor. In 1981, the Mediterranean fruit fly invaded the state's Central Valley, threatening to wreak havoc on California's huge agricultural industry.</span></p> <p><span>Despite farmers' concerns, Brown waffled for months before finally deciding to use the pesticide Malathion to fight the fly.</span></p> <p><span>But workers in the California Conservation Corps (CCC), many of whom were assigned the task of stripping trees of fruit as Malathion-carrying helicopters circled overhead, refused what they thought was hazardous duty.</span></p> <p><span>Rebuked by his own volunteers, Brown dispatched chief of staff B.T. Collins to restore order in the CCC. Collins saved the organization, but not without several dramatic confrontations that were embarrassing to the governor. At one meeting that has since become legend, a frustrated Collins responded to CCC worker complaints by downing a glass full of the pesticide.</span></p> <p><span>Still, the damage was done. Brown failed to carry a single state primary in his 1980 presidential bid and, meanwhile, faced threats of an insurgency by his Republican lieutenant governor.</span></p> <p><span>Brown ran for a U.S. Senate seat in 1982 against little known San Diego mayor Pete Wilson, now the state's governor. The election, however, quickly became a referendum on brown the governor--a referendum he lost.</span></p> <p><span>\"The election was all about Jerry Brown,\" says DiCamillo. \"It was a giant thumbs down on Jerry Brown.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>BROWNING OUT</b></span></p> <p><span>After the 1982 Senate defeat, Brown dropped out of politics, having learned the lesson that being the consummate political insider could be career-damaging.</span></p> <p><span>He travelled though Mexico, He helped Mother Theresa tend to the sick and poor in Calcutta, India and spent time in Japan studying Buddhism.</span></p> <p><span>After seven years in the jungle, Brown caught the political bug one again. In 1989 he reappeared, bearded, in California, offering his skills as a technocrat to the state Democratic Party.</span></p> <p><span>He was the insider again. The party made him chair, although they soon regretted it when Brown proved poor at getting out the vote--a weakness that may have cost the party several key elections.</span></p> <p><span>Although Brown had said repeatedly he would not run for office again, he openly flirted with the idea of running for one of California's two open Senate seats before finally opting for a presidential bid last September.</span></p> <p><span>\"He was ahead in the Democratic party poll in the senate races,\" said DiCamillo. \"I thought [the decision] was more personal--his interests were more on a national level.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>BACK IN THE RACE</b></span></p> <p><span>Jerry Brown's colorful career before he arrived on the presidential trail in 1992 speaks for itself. Besides the time off, he had spent nearly his entire adult life in the political arena--at times the upstart, at times the entrenched incumbent, but always a politician.</span></p> <p><span>So when Brown came on the scene with his \"outsider\" persona and a message that politicians can't be trusted, many long-time Brown Followers were cynical.</span></p> <p><span>\"His current incarnation is the most political of calculations,\" John B. Emerson, Los Angeles Brown counsel in the 1982 Senate race, told The New York Times.</span></p> <p><span>\"He believes the way he is campaigning is the only way Jerry Brown can resurrect himself politically,\" Emerson said.</span></p> <p><span>Besides capitalizing on the strong anti-incumbent trends in 90s U.S. politics, Brown has also tried to recapture his former aura of hipness.</span></p> <p><span>Endorsed by <i>Rolling Stone</i> and appearing regularly on MTV, Brown went hard after the young vote.</span></p> <p><span>\"I don't think there's any other candidate out there who could talk about Chuck D and Public Enemy and what his music means,\" says Tabitha Soren, political reporter for MTV.</span></p> <p><span>Still, Brown was not seen as a serious contender. Though he won points for his down-to-earth image, other Democratic candidates seemed annoyed at the air-time consumed by repeated pitches for his 800 number.</span></p> <p><span>But Brown is nothing if not tenacious. When the field narrowed to him, Clinton and Paul E. Tsongas, Brown began to build momentum. And, face to face with Clinton after Tsongas bowed out, Brown captured Connecticut and Vermont.</span></p> <p><span>New York was billed as a high pitched battle with Brown as the underdog. But, in that race, the man of many faces was slapped with the reality of his past.</span></p> <p><span>There were extensive reports on his ever changing persona. The Los Angeles Times charged that Brown had given key judicial appointments to large campaign contributors while he was governor.</span></p> <p><span>And even the name Edmund G. Brown Jr., which had served him so well on ballots in the past, confused Empire State voters who had come to know him as Jerry. He finished a disappointing third.</span></p> <p><span>Brown has sounded tired and defeated on the campaign trial in recent weeks, and aides say he has not decided what to do next. He has talked on occasion about starting a permanent campaign for political reform like Ralph Nader's, but some wonder if Brown will want to labor politically when the media spotlight is off.</span></p> <p><span>What persona Brown will take on next is anybody's guess. But almost assuredly he'll be back.</span></p> <p><span>He's flexible.</span></p>"}

He agrees <i>with a former leader of the KKK.</i> He must be a racist!.</span></p> <p><span>There you have it. The perfect syllogism. Duke supports workfare. Duke is a racist Clinton supports workfare. Ergo Clinton is also a racist.</span></p> <p><span><b>U</b>FAIR? Faulty reasoning? Tarring a perfectly legitimate candidate with the same brush as a blatantly racist hate-monger? yes. Anyone who finds such reasoning sound needs to take a basic logic course. No one with working neurons can say that just because a bigot like duke espouses a position, all who hold that position are racists.</span></p> <p><span>But that's what liberals, and The Crimson in particular, have been able to do to conservatives ever since Duke entered the national scene a few years back. And during Patrick J. Buchanan's presidential campaign, they've been doing it time and time again.</span></p> <p><span>Now don't get me wrong. I disagree with Buchanan's approach to politics and with many of his positions. The idea of throwing up a wall along the Mexican border to keep Latin American immigrants out of the U.S., for example, turns my stomach. I'd much rather have open borders.</span></p> <p><span>But Buchanan and other conservatives have many legitimate gripes.</span></p> <p><span>Take, for example, welfare reform. When ever Duke mentions welfare reform, I hear liberals huffing about \"code words.\" Well, perhaps, in Duke's mouth, \"welfare reform\" is a code phrase. He sure as hell didn't show too much compassion for Blacks or Hispanics or other poor people before.</span></p> <p><span>But when Buchanan mentions welfare reform, is he talking about the same thing that Duke is? Can liberals deny that a welfare system that raises a single mother's public housing rent from $60 a month to $600 a month if she marries needs reform? I hope not.</span></p> <p><span>Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack F. Kemp has been talking about welfare refrom for years. Even Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) admits that many welfare recipients are caught in a \"cycle of dependency.\" In Thursday's Boston Globe, Ellen Goodman came out in support of using welfare reforms to discourage women on welfare from having children out of wedlock. Are they too using code words?</span></p> <p><span><b>O</b>F COURSE, by definition conservatives have fundamental disagreements with liberals. To liberals, the conservative idea that the government should be \"tough on crime\" seems contradictory when viewed in light of an ideal of personal freedom. But only if the government punishes violence, thereby discouraging it, will society remain peaceful. Only a peaceful society can guarantee its citizens' freedom.</span></p> <p><span>Liberals, however, believe that equality should be he prime concern of the government. Along with equality, total freedom in the sexual realm and complete submission to government meddling in the economic realm (to foster equality) are hallmarks of liberalism.</span></p> <p><span>All that's needed for utopia, liberals imply, is more government spending on education (or Head Start, or housing, or drug counseling, or health care). If equality is at stake, freedom can fall by the wayside.</span></p> <p><span>Liberals, that is, don't trust the members of society to care. But they do trust the government to make everyone care.</span></p> <p><span>Conservatives like Buchanan and Kemp (and even President Bush, who is hardly a conservative) aren't against \"community feeling,\" They just think that \"community feeling\" is better expressed by community members rather than government bureaucrats (Who, after all, are in it for the money and power more than anything else.)</span></p> <p><span>Conservatives believe that the Reagan and Bush administrations haven't done enough to reform the federal government. or to return responsibility and power to the communities and states which have (and understand) local social problems.</span></p> <p><span>Under liberal direction, the U.S. government has created, in the name of equality, newer, more dangerous ghettos and an underclass dependent upon government funds. Conservatives say it's time to think about changing our welfare system, because <i>it doesn't work.</i></span></p> <p><span>Because he recognizes the rottenness of the welfare system, Buchanan appeals to lots of resentful people angry about \"welfare cheats.\" And he has waged a somewhat negative campaign, based on resentment of the Bush administration and arrogant government in general.</span></p> <p><span>But it's just a little too convenient for liberals to brand him a racist and an anti-Semite and leave it at that. I won't defend the infamous \"Israeli defense ministry and its amen corner\" assertion of Buchanan's anti-gulf War days.</span></p> <p><span>What I will say is that by tarring Buchanan and his ideas with the \"racist, sexist, homophobe\" brush, liberals easily escape having to debate him on his policy suggestions--which show no traces of racism, sexism or homophobia.</span></p> <p><span>By demanding that conservatives prove they aren't bigots before debating them, liberals can avoid proving their own positions. Affirmative action is a case in point.</span></p> <p><span>This type of discrimination will conservatives note, only increase the resentment of those whites who think they might be passed up for a job by a less-qualified member of a minority group. In fact, because affirmative action increases white resentment of minorities, the brunt of its negative effects fall upon...minorities.</span></p> <p><span>But because some liberals have already decided that affirmative action is just, they won't admit its ineffectiveness. Anyone voicing dissent about the means by which we should encourage minority participation in professions must, liberals say, be a bigot. The liberal message: If you disagree with our means, then you must not agree with our ends.</span></p> <p><span>Liberals, in other words, jettison the old maxim of moral philosophy, \"the ends do not justify the means.\" For liberals, \"the ends justify any means whatsoever, even if they're proven wrong.\" And if you disagree with the means, then you are a fascist.</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>HEN DAVID DUKE began sounding like a conservative rather than a fascist, conservatives should have worried more than liberals. Liberals squawked about him (and, thankfully, did a lot to help defeat his various bids for higher office). But they proceeded to equate his unprincipled adherence to certain conservative ideas to a proof that those ideas can only be held by bigots. David Duke, in other words, was a windfall for liberals.</span></p> <p><span>Now that Duke is all but gone from the national scene, however, liberals want to keep his memory alive, Because some of Duke's ideas sound conservative liberals think they can defeat conservatives by equating conservatism with Dukeism. Or Nazism.</span></p> <p><span>If they succeed, they will have proved only that they are masters of deceit. And they will still have failed to prove that their policies, embodied without success in American government for the past six decades, can do anything to help America.</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps it is because they recognize the bankruptcy of their ideas that liberals would rather call names than discuss issues.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Jews' Condemnation of Jesse Jackson Is Racist,  Unfair | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><i>To the Editors of The Crimson:</i></span></p> <p><span>There are a lot of people who do not agree with your April 15 editorial's dismissal of the notion that Black-Jewish tensions are serious problem right now, on campus and elsewhere. The Crimson, by so vehemently denying that there is a deeper problem, seems determined, as in the earlier Leonard Jeffries affair, to present only one side of the situation: righteous Jews crusading against anti-Semitic Blacks.</span></p> <p><span>I hope that by acknowledging that there is another side to Black-Jewish tensions, and making clear that there is a diversity of views even among Jews here, we can lift our discussion of this very emotional subject to a higher level.</span></p> <p><span>A key reason for Jerry Brown's poor showing in the New York primary was his declared wish to nominate Jesse Jackson as his running mate. This was apparently a crucial factor in the choice of an enormous majority of Jewish voters--90 percent--to vote against him.</span></p> <p><span>Although I am supporting Bill Clinton, I was hardly elated by Brown's \"blunder.\" It is hard to feel anything but sorrow and anger at this spectacle.</span></p> <p><span>As a New Yorker, I cannot imagine anyone who would be a better president or vice president for New York City than Jesse Jackson. No one has spoken more clearly than Jackson about the unmitigated catastrophe that the Reagan/Bush years have been for New York and other American cities. No one speaks more passionately then Jackson about the need for groups like Blacks and Jews to heal their differences and join together in pursuit of common goals.</span></p> <p><span>Jackson is a former associate of Martin Luther King, a leader in the Democratic Party, a man who has worked for years toward the goal of empowering and reintegrating poor people into our political and social systems. But he was so hated that even the <i>suggestion</i> by Brown that he would choose Jackson as his running mate was enough to rule out any consideration of the rest of Brown's message.</span></p> <p><span>We all know the supposed reasons for what happened, First, Jackson, in 1984, referred to New York as \"hymietown.\" Second, although he clearly repudiates the anti-Semitic remarks of Louis Farrakhan, Jackson refuses to condemn Farrakhan outright. Third, Jackson has met with Yassir Arafat and other Arab leaders, and urged the U.S. government to follow a Middle East policy that recognizes both Israel's right to peace and security and the rights of Palestinians to dignity and justice.</span></p> <p><span>These explanations are at best incomplete, and more likely downright disingenuous. The hymietown remark is a handy soundbits for Jewish antagonism toward Jackson, but the problem runs much deeper than that.</span></p> <p><span>It is ironic can hypocritical that Jews, who have such a hard time accepting the public airing of disagreements among Jews, should demand that Jackson go beyond a disavowal of the objectionable aspects of Farrakhan's message to a complete denunciation of the man. The demands that have been made of Jackson, with regard to Farrakhan, seem more like an attempt to humiliate Jackson in front the Black America than an expression of serious doubt about where he stands personally about Jews and anti-Semitism.</span></p> <p><span>As for his views on the Middle East, Jackson does discomfit some pro-Israel groups, because he understands that much of the world sees the Israeli-Arab conflict not as a battle between Jews and anti-Semites but as one between white European colonialists and colored natives. Jackson would never support a return to the blank check American patronage of Israel that some groups demand. I know that this is reason enough for some American Jews to refuse to support him for president, as is their right. It is wrong, however, to proclaim that Jackson's stance demonstrates anti-Semitism and makes him an enemy of the Jewish people. Jackson's views are not all that different from those of a substantial number of Jews.</span></p> <p><span>The New York Jewish community has shown itself to be a voting group with a very disturbing racial agenda. As they attempt cloak their intolerance in self-righteous outrage at persecution against Jews, they display their own bigotry in its full ugly colors.</span></p> <p><span>Last month I went home to New York to join my family in a service marking the 50th anniversary of the murder of my father's parents at Belzec, a Nazi death camp in Poland.

{"title": "Take Back the MAC | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>W</b>ITH THE arrival of spring comes the predictable surge of activity at the Malkin Athletic Center (MAC) as Harvard students frantically prepare their bodies for the transition from libraries and lecture halls to sea shores and swimming polls. Yet with each new face I see at the MAC these days, I grow ever more disdainful of Harvard's egalitarian approach to physical fitness.</span></p> <p><span>Some people just don't belong at the MAC. Plain and simple.</span></p> <p><span>You see, I'm what you might call a \"MAC rat,\" one of those fanatical, all-season, rain or shine, day and night devotees of Harvard's most extensive exercise facility. I resent the amateurs and dilettantes who have invaded the MAC at the expense of its most loyal users.</span></p> <p><span>We are to the MAC what Norm, Cliff and Fraser are to <i>Cheers,</i> the athletic equivalent of the Society of Nerds and Greeks.</span></p> <p><span>MAC rats have watched as the Harvard masses turned what was once a decent, wellkept gym into a noisy, overcrowded circus where one must scramble for weights, fight for dumbbells and stand in long lines for the most popular (and most misused) equipment. That's why so many of us wake up early to beat the crowds.</span></p> <p><span>But beyond the sheer volume of users these days, the MAC suffers other problems as well. For example, equipment frequently breaks or, worse yet, disappears--no doubt the handiwork if ingenious thieves who think they can accomplish more with a single 25-pound dumbbell in their room than with the entire set at the MAC.</span></p> <p><span><b>O</b>VER THE LAST few months I have identified several types of individuals whose expulsion from the MAC is necessary before we can reinvigorate the ideals of hard work and excellence that inspired its creation. While not scientific, my findings are the product of hours of frustrating encounters with countless nincompoops.</span></p> <p><span>The <i>talker.</i> By far the most common irritant in the MAC, the talker chit-chats with his buddies about last night's party or tomorrow's midterm while others wait for the equipment he pretends to be using. Loud and obnoxious, he disturbs others with his incessant guffawing and meaningless banter. The talker should take his tea party to Boston Harbor.</span></p> <p><span>The <i>reader.</i> Perhaps the most studious user of the MAC, the reader cannot pry herself away from a long enough to complete a workout. She fruitlessly attempts to build her mind while building her muscles. Often seen clutching a book while climbing the Stairmaster, the reader belongs in the library, not the MAC.</span></p> <p><span>The <i> meditator.</i> This one mystifies me. He seems eager to perform an exercise and may even ask you to spot him. But upon grasping the equipment, the meditator drifts into a trance of sorts, sitting motionless and staring into space. The meditator resembles the average student in a statistics lecture. He should seek professional counseling before ever coming near the MAC.</span></p> <p><span>The <i>grunter.</i> The most comic of all MAC miscreants, the grunter cannot help herself. When performing an exercise, she invariably growls, gasps, moans, snorts, screams or even yells to convey to everyone the intensity of her efforts. An interesting note: The grunter's loudness is inversely proportional to the quality of her workout.</span></p> <p><span>The <i>poser.</i> Closely related to his friend, the grunter, the poser spends most of his time in front of the mirror. Whether flexing his muscles, straightening his shirt or fixing his hair, the poser seems more interested in picking up dates than in packing up weights. To regain his focus, the poser should spend an evening with an officer of the Radcliffe Union of Students.</span></p> <p><span>To be sure, this list is not exhaustive. I have encountered many individuals whose behavior places them in more than on category. For example, the <i>mediator-poser</i> zones out while staring at himself in the mirror, as if frozen by the mere sight of himself in shorts. Others, like the guy who tried to do dumbbell biceps curls while holding a three-month-old infant in the other arm, defy any classification whatsoever. They're just weird.</span></p> <p><span><b>B</b>UT MORE importantly, they're dangerous--not only to themselves, but also to the continued maintenance and proper functioning of the MAC. As I see it, the MAC suffers from two principal problems that stem from its excessive accessibility to the public--overcrowding and misuse. To combat these evils, I propose two reforms: First, a <i>membership fee</i> of say, $25 per term, would force students to think seriously about their pursuit of physical fitness, thereby discouraging dabblers and jokers from wasting time at the MAC.</span></p> <p><span>Moreover, individual investment in the MAC would help alleviate the problems normally associated with public goods, such as Aristotle's famous \"tragedy of the commons.\" Right now, the MAC suffers the same neglect and mistreatment that afflict public housing projects, local parks and other products of modern socialism.</span></p> <p><span>Students with a financial stake in the MAC would no longer tolerate the incompetence of its current management. A $25 investment might concentrate responsibility and ownership enough to deter would-be thieves and abusers.</span></p> <p><span>Revenues generated by the fee could be used to repair damaged machines or purchase new equipment altogether.</span></p> <p><span>Admittedly, the imposition of a membership fee would be wildly unpopular, particularly in the wake of soaring tuition costs and George Bush's tax increases. What's worse, it might not produce the intended effect. Rather than reducing attendance at the MAC, such a fee might actually encourage rich students with no coordination or competence but lots of disposable income to return to the MAC more frequently and get the most for their dollar.</span></p> <p><span>Which is why, in addition to a membership fee, I also propose:</span></p> <p><span><i>Periodic certification.</i> You need not be a professional bodybuilder nor have an intimate knowledge of muscular kinesiology to qualify for membership at the MAC. But you would have to demonstrate a basic level of commitment to physical fitness and a level of competence that go beyond that of the typical back-to-school, New Year's resolution, Spring Break Crowd.</span></p> <p><span>Certification would insure not only the proper use of and respect for MAC equipment but also the safety of its users-- something the University talks a lot about when it comes to parties and fire extinguishers. A mandatory tutorial on weight training, taught by a friendly MAC rat, would be entirely consistent with the array of workshops, presentations and speeches that the administration forces firstyears to endure each fall.</span></p> <p><span><b>P</b>ROPONENTS of diversity will challenge the principles behind my proposals. Rather than merely promote bodybuilding excellence among a select elite, they would argue, the MAC should strive to include students of all skill levels and backgrounds. To do otherwise would smack a Buchanan-like nativism, even fascism.</span></p> <p><span>MAC rats, some might claim, apply too narrow a standard of \"excellence.\" We simply do not <i>understand</i> the reader nor appreciate the unique \"perspective\" she brings to the weight room.</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps. But there are plenty of gyms around campus where a reader can more effectively lend her unique perspective--Adams and Dunster come to mind--without causing so much consternation. Because it boasts the broadest selection and highest quality of equipment this side of the river, the MAC should cater only to the serious and successful, not the incompetent and insane.</span></p> <p><span>Besides, the combination of free weights, universal machines and Nautilus equipment already guarantees some degree of pluralism and diversity at the MAC.</span></p> <p><span><b>P</b>LEASE don't misunderstand us. MAC rats support, indeed encourage, the popular pursuit of physical fitness at all levels of skill and interest, just as celebrated pianists might promote an appreciation of music among the general public. But never having taken piano lessons, I have no more a right to bang the keys in Paine Hall than the <i>talker</i> has to bang the weights in the MAC.</span></p> <p><span>Ever suspicious of regulatory red tape, conservatives might object to user fees and certification requirements as unwarranted intrusions into the pocketbooks and lives of Harvard students, the latest steps down the path of administrative micromanagement that began with randomization in 1990.</span></p> <p><span>The current situation, however, contains market distortions painfully obvious to any defender of free enterprise. Moreover, one must recall Thomas Jefferson's dictum: \"eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.\"</span></p> <p><span>Indeed, MAC rats must vigilantly protect their precious liberties before they are drowned in a cesspool of mediocrity. To do any less would be unhealthy.</span></p> <p><span><i>Mark J Sneider '93 has seen every Arnold Schwarzenegger film. Twice.</i></span></p>"}

{"title": "Don't Ignore East Timor | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>HE NOVEMBER 12 massacre of 100 men, women and children in East Timor by the Indonesian army was unusual only because there were American witnesses to the crime. Since Indonesia's 1976 occupation of the island, 200,000 people, or roughly a third of East Timor's population, have been killed by the army or starved by the Indonesian occupiers.</span></p> <p><span>Amy Goodman '79, a news editor for WBAI/Pacifica Radio, and Allan Nairn, a reporter for the <i>New Yorker</i>, who both spoke last night at the Kennedy School, witnessed the November 12 massacre and were nearly killed themselves by the Indonesian soldiers. The soldiers beat the reporters with the butts of their M-16s, fracturing Nairn's skull, The two journalists believe that it is only the fact that they are American that saved their lives.</span></p> <p><span>Goodman and Nairn arrived in East Timor, which is off the North coast of Australia, to cover the visit of a United Nations/Portuguese team investigating the island's political future. Portugal ruled the island for 270 years until its withdrawal in 1975.</span></p> <p><span>The investigation was cancelled by the Portuguese due to the tension it created in East Timor. The army threatened to kill anybody who would meet with the delegation. One senior officer told villagers in the Venilale region that if they spoke to the foreign delegates, everyone between the ages of 10 and 45 would be shot. They said that the army had already dug mass graves.</span></p> <p><span>On November 12, 1992, thousands of Timorese gathered for a procession and demonstration in memory of Sebastiao Gomes, a young man who was killed for speaking out against the Indonesian government. They met at the church in Dili, East Timor, in which Gomes had sought refuge and where he was found by the Indonesian soldiers. His blood was still caked on the church steps.</span></p> <p><span>The people in the procession proceded from the church to the Santa Cruz cemetery, carrying banners and shouting for the independence of East Timor. After the procession reached the Dili cemetary, the Timorese noticed that soldiers had closed off the street and were marching towards the demonstrators.</span></p> <p><span>The soldiers, in formation, raised their M-16s and took aim at the procession. They opened fire directly into the dense crowd of men, women and children. The Indonesian government claims that only 19 people were killed. Eyewitnesses to the massacre (and Amnesty International) say that about 100 were killed and hundreds more were wounded.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>G</i></b>OODMAN AND Nairn's report has provoked an international outcry against the Indonesian government. The Netherlands, the former colonial rulers of Indonesia, suspended all aid--totalling some $100 million--pending the outcome of an Indonesian investigation into the massacre. Representative Ronald Machtley (R-R.I.) has sponsored a bill to cut off US military aid to Indonesia. A letter to President bush signed by 50 congressmen urged him to reconsider Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor. Current U.S. aid to Indonesia totals $50 million. But the support of the U.S. government for the Indonesian regime is far more valuable than that figure would indicate, as it enables Jakarta to secure $5 billion annually from American and European sources.</span></p> <p><span>The U.S. State Department, however, is not in favor of any suspension of American aid because it, \"contributes to the professionalism of the military and exposes it to democratic and humanitarian standards,\" according to a State Department spokesman.</span></p> <p><span>Furthermore, the U.S. government accepted the official Indonesian account of the massacre, minimizing the political damage to Jakarta from the massacre.</span></p> <p><span>The United States bears a particular responsibility to the people of East Timor because it sanctioned and encouraged their 16-year occupation by Indonesia. Our government even supported Indonesia's occupation of East Timor even before it happened. The invasion of East Timor occurred on December 7, 1975, the day after President Ford and Secretary of State Kissinger visited Jakarta and were informed of the planned invasion. Despite the fact that 90 percent of Indonesia's arms came from the U.S., they raised no objection to the plan.</span></p> <p><span>The invasion, and the Ford administration's tacit approval, violated the terms of a 1958 U.S.-Indonesian accord which stated that U.S. arms could not be used for external agression. After the annexation of East Timor, Kissinger said that \"we understand Indonesia's position.\"</span></p> <p><span>When a junior officer in the State Department reported the violation, his superior ordered the report shredded, so that there would not be a record of the government's duplicity on the issue.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE INTERNATIONAL awareness prompted by last November's massacre has not brought an end to the strife in East Timor. Clashes between groups at odds over Indonesia's presence persist. As of February 26 this year, Indonesia instituted a ban on any foreign journalists entering East Timor.</span></p> <p><span>The Bush administration should not ignore the illegal occupation of East Timor just because it is not as rich as Kuwait. East Timor is as deserving of self-determination as the Arab sheikdom or the former republics of the former Soviet empire. Its oil resources, so coveted by the Indonesian and Australian governments, would guarantee it economic stability. There are dozens of nations of smaller size in the UN.</span></p> <p><span>In this period in which dozens of peoples are finally seeing the end of military rule, it would be appropriate for our president to be on the side of those struggling for self-determination for East Timor, rather than extending the dreadful status quo.</span></p>"}

Sound like Stephen King? Try again. Christopher Durang, modern bard of the dark comedy, brings us his persistent television whose violent and tasteless programming reflects the horrific state of modern society.</span></p> <p><span>Although <i>Media Amok's</i> concept is an intriguing one, Durang fails to develop it into more than that. Thin writing and uninspired humor, uncharacteristic of Durang's usual sharp-wittedness, leave us only with the television gimmick, and it is simply not enough to sustain an entire evening in the theater.</span></p> <p><span>\"Poor us,\" gripes gray haired Cecilia (Anne Pitoniak),\"the ozone layer is disappearing, we don't know what to do about nuclear waste. Should we try to distract ourselves and watch a little television?\" She and husband Nigel (Alvin Epstein) turn on the television, only to find a scorching intensification of their worries in the coarse, vulgar, and manipulative personalities who grace their set.</span></p> <p><span>Enter foul-mouthed Morton Hell (Steven Black) and his four Yahoos (living incarnations of Morton Downey Jr. and his obnoxious studio audience); Felicia Falana (Christina Estabrook), a Sally Jesse Raphael-like monster woman whose concern for her interviewees is as genuine as her hair piece; and Phylicia Butterworth (Starla Benford) and Chuck Buck (Michael Starr), early morning talk show hosts who sit on giant coffee cups and are equipped with saccharine sweet salutations.</span></p> <p><span>They are joined by a motley crew of transvestites, transsexuals, presidential candidates (George Bush and \"Some Tired Old Liberal\"), heartless right to lifers, leather clad feminists and a bevy of other ingratiating characters (35 in totem), all played by a very versatile 12 member ensemble.</span></p> <p><span>Durang aims to devour them all, and a sumptuous feast it should be. However, his character assassinations go too often for the obvious, never really piercing the level of sophomoric, imitative humor one might find in an amateur parody.</span></p> <p><span>Morton Hell curses. Forty \"fucks\" in the first five minutes of his appearance. Fine. But that is all he does. Durang makes little attempt at any satire more insightful than this. Of all Morton's lines the one which the audience seems to find most amusing is his holler at a reticent nun, \"Get off my show you fucking, fuck face penguin.\"</span></p> <p><span>Even when Durang does come through with a witty line, he buries it in script which takes the joke too far and detracts from its effectiveness. \"Sorry, I don't mean to act like I have an opinion,\" says a momentarily sincere Felicia Falana to her TV audience. Funny, really funny. But when she goes on and on, asserting, among other things that she \"agrees with everyone,\" the line just loses it humor. By stating the obvious in what seems like a deliberate over-kill of the lines, Durang weakens some of his best satire.</span></p> <p><span>The play certainly has moments which work, and some on-target performances which are really fun to watch. Christine Estabrook creates a delightfully caustic Falana who is rapidly loosing her cool after 20 consecutive hours on the television, and Michael Starr has the sleazy, pretty boy Chuck down to a science. The eventual crossing between \"reality\" and the world of TV--when Cecilia becomes trapped in the television set after \"accidentally walking into a talk show\"--is truly frightening.</span></p> <p><span>Durang and director Les Waters do manage to create an intolerably grating atmosphere through the use of screeching sirens, loud music, and strobe lights. However, blasting loud music and shouting curses does not a clever satire make. And unfortunately for Water's concept, this pandemonium makes the evening a little too unpleasent for an audience which, after all, has chosen to go to the theater rather than watch it on</span></p>"}

The Rodney King verdict touched off violence around the country. It is horrifying to watch videotaped footage of this--of buildings burning out of control in Los Angeles, of Black businesses burned down, of a truck driver being pulled out of his truck and beaten into critical condition, of Korean shop owners with semi-automatic weapons defending their property from looters, of young children running scared through the streets.</span></p> <p><span>Still, it is understandable given how horrible it is to watch the tape of Rodney King being billyclubbed dozens of times.</span></p> <p><span>Indeed, most people are justifiably angry about the verdict.

The only threats he presented to the officers were his color and his gender. By virtue of being a Black male, by virtue of being strong and able (\"like a bear,\" as characterized by the defense), King was immediately suspect and automatically assumed to be guilty.</span></p> <p><span>Blacks in Los Angeles rioted because they are psychologically and physically beaten on a consistent basis. To most Blacks, the King verdict revealed that the American judicial system could not provide justice for them.</span></p> <p><span>Neither the American government nor the public should direct their energies toward controlling the intensity of Black anger. The reasons why we are angry need to be addressed--not the anger itself or the manner in which we choose to express it. Americans must be willing to attack the cause of this country's problems, not the effects of those problems.</span></p> <p><span>Rioting itself is an extension of the politics of protest. In<i> Political Process and the Development of Black Insurgency</i>, Doug McAdam analyzes the effectiveness of disruptive political action. Both riots and non-violent demonstrations such as sit-ins and marches \"may constitute the only available means by which excluded groups can overcome their traditional powerlessness within institutionalized political channels.\"</span></p> <p><span>In the past, Black riots have stimulated or hastened long sought-after federal action. In<i> Black Violence</i>, a study of the federal reaction to urban riots, James Button concludes that in response to riots, government enacted national socioeconomic reform policies more quickly than in response to \"conventional forms of political participation\" in many cities throughout the country.</span></p> <p><span>\"Those who argue that collective violence is necessarily beyond the pale of effective political action and is totally counterproductive in terms of achieving any of the goals set forth by the practitioners of violence are, on the basis of this study, in serious error,\" Button wrote.</span></p> <p><span><b>B</b>LACK AMERICANS do not receive equal concern and respect typically given to oppressed peoples by the national government. When riots occur in other parts of the world, Americans applaud the civilians who are attempting to correct or overthrow repressive, Communist or hostile regimes.</span></p> <p><span>In the case of the Soviet Union, President Bush has not only applauded the sometimes violent transformation, but has allocated millions of dollars in aid to new republics.</span></p> <p><span>However, many Americans cannot or will not understand the Los Angeles riots, because they believe that America is above repression.</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately, the violence and uncertainty that many white Los Angeles residents experienced because of the rioting is equal to what residents in neighboring minority communities suffer daily.</span></p> <p><span>Although we are not responsible for the subordinate position we occupy in this society, most Blacks are willing to solve their own problems. However, we cannot uplift ourselves when we are constantly affected by outside influences that effectively maintain the status quo, including the infusion of drugs and guns, severely underfunded and inferior schools, police brutality and general disrespect.</span></p> <p><span>Black people can exercise control over their own destiny if they are given the means to exercise economic empowerment. We need economic and political control over our own communities.</span></p> <p><span>Operating under the assumption that they must \"study\" the \"ghetto mentality\" before releasing control over public resources, whites are often wary of Black community control.</span></p> <p><span>There is no ghetto mentality. Blacks from all economic and social classes are capable of undertaking the task of restructuring their surroundings--and they are the only ones who really know how to do so.</span></p> <p><span>Blacks do not enjoy crime and violence any more the whites do. But the two groups differ in their ability to effectively institute solutions because Black Americans are burdened with the legacy of second-class citizenship and the continued existence of racism and discrimination.</span></p> <p><span><b>P</b>ERHAPS the Rodney King verdict most vividly reveals the entrenchment of institutionalized racism and the depth of racial prejudice in America. King's trial demonstrates the continued effectiveness of racial stereotypes in both delegitimizing legal processes and altering individual perceptions.</span></p> <p><span>Blacks cannot solve their problems until whites solve theirs--the fear of inner-city youths and the fear of educated ones.</span></p> <p><span><i>Jenifer E.

{"title": "Buchanan Was Misrepresented | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><i>To the Editors of The Crimson:</i></span></p> <p><span>I read your reluctant endorsement of President Bush with great interest, and one sentence in particular caught my attention: \"The future of the Republican Party--admittedly, not usually a prime concern of The Crimson--is at stake.\"</span></p> <p><span>Actually, I think the future of the Republican Party is one thing you do care about--you want it to lose the coming elections. What you really don't care about are minor details like accuracy and fairness when writing about the Republican Party and its candidates, especially Pat Buchanan.</span></p> <p><span>One glaring inaccuracy is your charge that Buchanan is an anti-Semite, which you backed up solely by saying, \"even his archconservative pal William Buckley admits it.\" I am happy that you trust Buckley, but I don't think that's what he meant at all when he wrote about Buchanan in the December 30 issue of <i>National Review</i>, although his words have been misinterpreted. In the March 16 issue of <i>National Review</i>, Buckley wrote the following in response to a letter signed by 13 prominent conservatives:</span></p> <p><span>\"I wrote that the content of Mr. Buchanan's quoted remarks was indeed anti-Semitic, 'whatever it was that drove him to say and do it: most probably, an iconoclastic temperament.' In short, I communicated my own private guess that Buchanan is not anti-Semitic.\"</span></p> <p><span>So really, you didn't use any evidence whatsoever to back up this charge. But I guess you don't have to use facts in editorials, or mention that Buchanan emphatically denies the charge, or that his Maryland campaign chair is Jewish.</span></p> <p><span>If you think he is anti-Semitic, you should at least present <i>some</i> proof. I suggest that you were so eager to denounce Buchanan that it really didn't matter if you knew what you were talking about or not.</span></p> <p><span>Equating Buchanan with David Duke is also entirely inaccurate. It seems to me that Duke has coopted Buchanan's rhetoric, and not vice versa. Buchanan has been penning his conservative opinions for decades, while Duke is only a recent (and quite dubious) convert to conservatism.</span></p> <p><span>And as William F. Buckley (whose opinions you seem to respect) wrote in the December 30 issue of <i>National Review</i>, \"The linkage [of Duke and Buchanan] is morally irresponsible....Duke the sometime KKK wizard and Nazi enthusiast is as reasonably linked with Buchanan as Norman Thomas is with Stalin.\" That is to say, not very.</span></p> <p><span>Does Buchanan really use \"Dukesque racial code words\"? No. You just took his words out of context. What Buchanan did was to express his opinion that America is a Western nation.

{"title": "What You Can Do for Syria's Jews | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>W</b>E ALL REMEMBER the headlines that accompanied Terry A. Anderson out of Lebanon in December. The last American hostage in the Middle East had been freed. An era of kidnappings, death threats and black-and-white prison photos had come to a close.</span></p> <p><span>It was, in fact, a sickening sight: The newly released hostages pictured in their first news briefing beneath the all-knowing gaze of Syrian President Hafez el-Assad. We had to thank our suddenly pro-Western friends, Iran and Syria, for their deep concern for human life.</span></p> <p><span>We should have recognized them as dictatorial regimes pandering for money before democracies. That's all. Nothing else.</span></p> <p><span>But before we pack up those \"Number of Days in Captivity\" signs and heave a sigh of relief that our new-found allies have finally read Locke and Rousseau, we need to take a closer look.</span></p> <p><span>There are thousands of hostages still being held in the Middle East. I can name 4000 to start.</span></p> <p><span>They're all Jews. They're all trapped in Syria. And with a guy like Assad staring down at them day and night, their prospects for a freer life in the near future appear dim at best.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>ODAY IS A DAY observed across the globe as one of prayer and mourning--prayer for the rescue of the oppressed Jewish community in Syria and mourning for the four women who were murdered while trying to flee Syria in 1974.</span></p> <p><span>The Sebbagh sisters--Laura, 28; Mazal, 26; Farah, 20--and their 18-year-old cousin, Eva Saad, were caught at the border, raped and murdered by Syrian authorities, who then stuffed the women's disfigured bodies in trash bags and dropped them off at their parents' doorsteps.</span></p> <p><span>This was a warning to Jews everywhere not to repeat such attempts to escape. The message had been broadcast loud and clear.</span></p> <p><span>This signal of sinister hatred has reached outraged groups and individuals around the world. The Sebbagh and Saad murders have become a symbol of the struggle to free Syrian Jews. The blood of those innocent women, shed 18 years ago, was not spilled in vain.</span></p> <p><span>Most of the Jews left in Syria live in Damascus and about 500 others live in Aleppo and Kamishli. The community confined to the Syrian capital resides in a ghetto, called Harate Al-Yehud (\"the Jewish Quarter\"), and is subject to 24-hour-a-day surveillance by the Mukhabarat, the Syrian secret police.</span></p> <p><span>For the Jews living in Damascus, there's one secret police officer for every 20 Jews. And Assad is worried that Jews might be able to escape?</span></p> <p><span>The Mukhabarat keeps individual files on all Syrian Jews. It taps Jews' phones, reads their mail, monitors their contracts with foreigners, restricts the sale of their property and prohibits the teaching and speaking of the Hebrew language.</span></p> <p><span>But worse of all is Syria's ban on Jewish emigration. Syria is the only Arab nation that, since 1949, has denied its Jewish citizens the right to leave. No Jew is allowed to leave the country for good.</span></p> <p><span>To travel abroad, he or she must first go through a lengthy procedure, including a government interview, and then post a substantial bond--between $5000 and $10,000--and leave at least one family member behind. This ransom requirement applies to the Jewish community--not to any other minority group.</span></p> <p><span>The case within the Syrian Jewish community that has received the greatest international attention is that of the Swed brothers. Eli, 31, and Selim, 51, were arrested in 1987 on suspicion of traveling to Israel while abroad. For two years, Syrian officials refused to acknowledge whether the brothers were dead or alive and not until 1990 were they allowed regular visits with their families.</span></p> <p><span>The damp subterranean basement which was their prison cell caused the two to become severely ill and Eli is said to have contracted tuberculosis. Last May, in a closed trial, the brothers were officially charged with \"illegally traveling to enemy-occupied territory\" and sentenced to six and one-half years in prison, where they remain to this day.</span></p> <p><span><b>C</b>ERTAINLY JEWS are not the only group in Syria oppressed by Assad's iron fist. Thousands of political prisoners are held without trial, some languishing in their cells for over 20 years. A 1987 Amnesty International report identified 35 forms of torture used in Syrian prisons--cruelty that knows no sectarian or religious boundaries.</span></p> <p><span>But while Christian, Muslim and Druse communities face restrictions on travel and emigration, none are fully barred from permanently leaving as are Jews. With the stamp <i>Musawi</i> (\"Mosaic\") on their passport, Jews are the only Syrians whose religious identity appears on internal travel documents.</span></p> <p><span>Jews have the dubious distinction of being subjected to greater persecution and lack of liberties than any other group in a country where human rights means little more than the privilege to breath the air.</span></p> <p><span>What, if anything, can be done to break this merciless oppression? Call me an out-of-touch, overly idealistic college kid, but student activism can truly make a difference. When it comes to fighting oppression of minority communities around the globe, those in universities have shown they can influence positive change.</span></p> <p><span>Take, for example, Harvard Students for a Democratic China. Addressing the human rights situation in China following the 1989 Tienanmen Square massacre, the student group has organized rallies, vigils, fasts and forums in an attempt to draw attention to the efforts of a beleaguered pro-democracy movement.</span></p> <p><span>In May 1990, the organization successfully passed a resolution in Congress that was then ratified by President Bush. At the time, President Derek C. Bok called it \"the most successful student legislative effort ever in his 20 years at Harvard.\" A group of students clearly showed that campus activism can produce results.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard's Amnesty International chapter has shown the productive nature of fighting oppression as well. By organizing letter-writing campaigns, circulating petitions and marching in rallies, the group has, for example, publicized the plight of the Haitian refugees.</span></p> <p><span>Another recent project has involved correspondence with the Guatemalan government in an attempt to ease the political persecution of trade unionists in that country. Of course one can't gauge a direct cause-and-effect with such student efforts, but focusing attention on the oppression of a specific community may change international attitudes on the subject.</span></p> <p><span>The siege situation of Syrian Jewry is no different. While no one expects even a flinch from Assad--a man who had no qualms about bulldozing over the northern Syrian town of Hama in 1982, burying 20,000 of his own citizens in the process--in response to a student protest, possibilities for change are beginning to surface.</span></p> <p><span>Beyond letter writing and protesting, students could aid the effort to organize proxy marriages in order to get single Jewish women out of Assad's oppressive country. Since many Jewish men have managed to escape, Jewish women are frequently left with no one within the faith to marry. Marrying Americans as a matter of convenience has worked in the past to satisfy Assad's conditions for emigration.</span></p> <p><span>The U.S. government has been working on other positive efforts. Last November, as a result of State Department efforts, Assad agreed to release four Jewish prisoners being held for trying to leave the country. At least in order to further his rapprochement with the West, Assad may become more receptive to overtures from U.S. officials regarding issues of human rights in his country.</span></p> <p><span>Congress has also taken up the cause. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy '54-'56 (D-Mass.) is circulating a \"Dear Colleague\" letter this week on the Hill that, among other issues, pleads the case to Assad for allowing free emigration for Syrian Jews. The House of Representatives has come forward on this matter as well, forming the Congressional Caucus on Syrian Jewry two years ago. The caucus now claims more than 65 members.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE HIGHER PROFILE accorded to the plight of Syrian Jews is evident in its mention in international arenas. At the recent Middle East peace conference in Madrid, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir raised the issue, saying the Jews in Syria have \"been exposed to cruel oppression, torture and discrimination of the worst kind.\" Turning to the Syrian delegates, he pleaded, \"We appeal to you to let Jews who wish to leave your countries go.\"</span></p> <p><span>The response of Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa was far from encouraging: \"Everyone knows that Syrian Jews live on full equality and with the same freedoms of other Syrian citizens who happen to have other faiths.\" The equal right to choose which method of torture to take is really a great way of establishing a level playing field.</span></p> <p><span>Even less hopeful was the action of a senior Syrian diplomat at the February 1991 meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva. He advised others to get a copy of the book at the top of his recommended reading list, <i>The Matzah of Zion</i>, an updated version of the infamous <i>Damascus Blood Libel of</i> 1840, which accused 16 Jews of murdering a Catholic priest and his servant in order to use their blood to bake Passover matzah. At least the issue of Syrian Jews is surfacing in the corridors of international meetings.</span></p> <p><span>Students have made a difference in the past on issues of human rights abuses. In the case of the Syrian Jews there is a lot that needs to be done, and a lot that can be done by students.</span></p> <p><span>A campus that is concerned with securing human rights for people all over the world should take up the cause of Syrian Jews. The American hostages may be out of the Middle East, but we can't stop fighting until the last captives of such oppressive regimes are truly free.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Beating the System | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>F</b>RONT-RUNNERS often have a hard time recognizing that they are not the centers of the universe. This is what helped doom Gary Hart's campaign when he invited the press to follow him around to see if he was up to any hanky-panky. And it's what helped do in Michael S. Dukakis when he rolled his eyes and ignored his staff's advice to counter the Willie Horton ad directly.</span></p> <p><span>And now, as Bill Clinton responds to near-weekly allegations with little more than a made-for-TV smile, some voters seem to think that his response typifies easy Southern charm and resilience. My inkling is that Clinton is just a candidate who can already smell the velvet drapery of the Oval Office.</span></p> <p><span>As the apparent dog-fight between Bill Clinton and Paul Tsongas degenerates into barb-trading and negative campaigning, they've begun to ignore real issues.</span></p> <p><span>But former California Governor Jerry Brown has talked directly about the issue of power--the only real issue.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>N A WORD, it comes down to money. The 800 number, the $100 cap on contributions, the grass roots style--Brown has based his campaign on refusing to accommodate the powerful elite in America.</span></p> <p><span>This strategy has been scorned by many pundits and media consultants alike. But it's working. Long after Senators Bob Kerrey and Tom Harkin dropped out, saddled with millions in debt, Brown is still alive.</span></p> <p><span>And although he cites his 800 number every time you turn around, earning him derision as the most annoying candidate in the race, such tactics deserve to be the centerpiece of a campaign.</span></p> <p><span>Throughout the primary season, the Democratic contenders have railed against Brown's assertion that they are part of a corrupt system that is rigged in favor of \"big-money interests.\" Yes, it's the stuff of stump speeches, but corporations, political action committees (PACs) and wealthy individuals do have an unparalleled impact on the way the public chooses its leaders.</span></p> <p><span>And although a congressional effort to reform campaign finance in 1974 limited personal contributions to $1000, the move was a simple palliative which did little to curtail the prohibitive costs of campaigning for national office.</span></p> <p><span>The one characteristic that large campaign donors seem to have in common is that they are wealthy--and intend to say that way. They tend to be conservative, which is why centrist candidates like Bill Clinton, a former chair of the conservative Democratic Leadership Council, often attract the most money.</span></p> <p><span><b>B</b>UT THE OTHER candidates just don't get it--or pretend not to get it. The most chilling moment of the campaign occurred in a recent debate when former Sen. Paul E. Tsongas tried to dispute Brown's point about how monied interests influence the system.</span></p> <p><span>Tsongas lamely claimed that even without an artificial limit, his average donation remained about $100. But a recent USA Today article on fat-cat financing showed that fully 30 percent of Tsongas' funds came from contributors who gave $1000. The figure for Bill Clinton was higher, 41 percent, and, as expected, still higher for President Bush at 70 percent.</span></p> <p><span>The problem is that these candidates refuse to acknowledge that the people from whom they accept big donations and PAC funds are the same ones who demand disproportionate influence in Congress. The average voter can probably give $100, but when the stakes start getting much higher, they've become too great for the average citizen to participate.</span></p> <p><span>And there are other problems. The current tax code, for example, is over 4000 pages long and is unintelligible to the average American because it is riddled with so many loopholes and tax breaks for various corporations and even wealthy individuals. Tax reform in the '80s closed some of these loopholes, but the system is still an unfair one.</span></p> <p><span>The second part of Tsongas' rebuttal to Brown was that, as he rather proudly asserted, he had only had one Wall Street fund-raiser--just three days before, in fact. But that was precisely the point.</span></p> <p><span>Tsongas admitted that he raised more money in the three days after New Hampshire than in the nine months leading up to it. One might think that his pro-business message would have been a natural for corporate donors.</span></p> <p><span>But if they were so impressed by Tsongas' message, they had plenty of time to give money in the year-long period that Tsongas had been stumping. What changed wasn't the message, but that Tsongas won New Hampshire. Suddenly, he looked electable. Suddenly, it was his influence the Wall Streeters were after.</span></p> <p><span>The point is that big money follows the front-runner. Bill Clinton's huge war chest proves that. As G.W. Dumhoff documented in <i>The Powers That Be</i> (1978), it doesn't matter whether the candidate is a Democrat or a Republican--fat cats want a stake in the winner. In fact, a 1972 study showed that 36 percent of contributors who gave $10,000 and up contributed to candidates of both political parties.</span></p> <p><span>The point of Jerry Brown's focus on money and power is that he wants to empower regular people and pull them back into the system. Voter participation rates have followed a declining trend, and voter apathy appears to be reaching an all-time high--either because people are unimpressed by the candidates or feel that they can't influence them.</span></p> <p><span>Money has a lot to do with that. It has dead-locked the political process and stacked it in favor of the wealthiest interests. Ineffectual policies regarding the environment, tax reform, health care, energy and campaign finance all result from the undue influence of these interests.</span></p> <p><span>But Brown has attempted to show that telephone technology (of all things) can actually circumvent the conventional channels for reaching out to the public. And laugh as much as you want--it's kept him in the race.</span></p> <p><span><b>O</b>NE REASON THAT Brown may have been ignored or characterized as flaky by the media--even after winning three states and finishing a close second in several others--is that he has refused to play by their rules. Television stations have received millions of dollars from the other candidates for paid advertisements, but much less from the Brown campaign. Brown has rejected $1000-a-plate dinners and eschewed most 30-second commercials.</span></p> <p><span>Discounted by the media with the two-word epithet \"Governor Moonbeam,\" Brown was relegated to the second tier from the start. He doesn't have wellpaid publicists, speech writers or pollsters. With only seven paid people and all the rest volunteers--unheard of in a national campaign--he managed to outlast many rivals.</span></p> <p><span>But even many of those who understand Brown's message of political stagnation stop short of supporting him. Some claim that they'd vote for him if only they thought he was electable. That's something I've heard again and again--and it's part of the process that Brown's talking about.</span></p> <p><span>We have come to a point in our history where ideas may languish because of overzealous political punditry. People feel that elections are decided in advance by political consultants and media commentators. Indeed, as the drama, is played out--in a series of out-takes and sound-bites--these commentators have a vested, professional interest in making sure the outcome coincides with their predictions.</span></p> <p><span>Others claim that Brown is disingenuous because as the chair of the Democratic Party of California, he was a master at fundraising who even opposed limitations just two years ago. Indeed, Brown raised millions of dollars during his period in office. And it was because of that experience that he realized how pervasive a hold money has on the system. If from his experience Brown doesn't have the right to expose the system and try to reform it, who will step forward?</span></p> <p><span>It certainly won't be George Bush. Or Bill Clinton.</span></p>"}

And he became president--while in the 1990's, Bob Kerrey and Paul Tsongas couldn't even afford to hang on until the Democratic Convention.</span></p> <p><span>Call it trite--that old \"American Dream\" of rags to riches, which (like most political ideals) was probably always more of a dream than a reality. Though the cliche may not accurately describe the workings of America's economy, it embodies certain democratic values--like the openness of the political system to all worthy individuals regardless of their class background--values which are so engrained in the American character that every candidate still feels obliged to pay lip service to them even when they are less of a reality than ever.</span></p> <p><span>The presidential primaries' emphasis on style over substance too often weeds out candidates who can't afford expensive public relations campaigns, and allows the more well-heeled survivors to repackage themselves as men of the people.</span></p> <p><span>Is it any wonder the last few administrations have been insensitive to the poor, when successful presidential candidates must either be wealthy themselves or pander to rich special interest groups in order to survive the campaign process?</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>SONGAS' RECENT LOSS to Bill Clinton is a case in point. Clinton is an upper middle class, Ivy League-trained politician, and also a frequent guest at an all-white country club whose dues are $20,000 a year. Yet his professional PR consultants (including the producers of <i>Designing Women</i>) had successfully turned him into the blue-collar candidate--until Jerry Brown took over that image--while the comparatively less affluent Tsongas was pegged as the representative of Brie and squash courts.</span></p> <p><span>In addition, skillful media handling has enabled Clinton's campaign to survive revelations that would have derailed many another candidate's career. One cannot underestimate the role of the media in establishing and maintaining Clinton's status as front-runner despite his alleged financial and marital indiscretions.</span></p> <p><span>But it would be all too easy to give up and say that only expensive PR campaigns matter to the voters any more. Tsongas' success in the Northeast showed that people are ready for an end to the hype. Jerry Brown's lowbudget campaign has filled the void Tsongas left behind. The Connecticut primary resulted in a one percentage point difference between Brown and Clinton, and polls indicate that there would have been a majority for Tsongas had he not quit. Showy packaging isn't everything--yet.</span></p> <p><span>Kerrey and Tsongas did the voters a disservice when they dropped out of the race. If they had stayed in and conducted less expensive no-frills campaigns--as Tsongas did at the start--they might have helped shift the focus of the electoral process from images to ideas. Instead, Kerrey blew all his money on PR, and even Tsongas attempted to fight on Clinton's terms. This just reinforced the destructive notion that the race is to the slick.</span></p> <p><span>Moreover, there was a chance (at least for Tsongas) that the \"uncandidate\" approach might have won out. The Connecticut primary, and possibly the upcoming New York primary, could have made him a serious contender again despite his defeat in the South. But now the public perception that you have to be rich (or have rich friends) to be president is stronger than ever, adding to the growing disillusionment among American voters.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>N A TIME OF economic crisis, when the country awakens with a hangover from the feel-good '80's, candidates who spend too much money advertising themselves arouse many people's suspicions. However, if less affluent candidates accept the system as it is, they end up spending all their money on insufficient PR and then dropping out, a form of Darwinian natural selection of the rich and famous that leaves the voters no choice but to support a style-over-substance candidate because he's the only one left.</span></p> <p><span>It's time for the less wealthy presidential hopefuls to stop disappointing the voters and to make the most of who they are, glamorous or not. Jerry Brown's unstylish style may set a good example in this respect, whether or not he has the other elements of a good president. At least he believes that the Oval Office doesn't have to be the playground of the upper classes.</span></p>"}

We welcome your submissions.</i></span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>FTER MONTHS OF hard-fought battling between numerous candidates, the '92 campaign is beginning to fall into place. The lengthy winnowing process is virtually over, and two leading candidates have emerged, ready to face the nation.</span></p> <p><span>One is nearing the end of a wildly successful career. The other is a rising young star. One is plagued by setbacks but still commands great national respect for his past accomplishments. The other is riding the tide of solid southern support while constantly pursued by rumors of womanizing.</span></p> <p><span>While each side has its fervent supporters, many voters plan to stay home, complaining that the choices are too similar. Who will prevail? Only the American public knows for sure.</span></p> <p><span>A succinct review of the upcoming Bush-Clinton battle? Not quite. I'm following the real race: the Elvis Election.</span></p> <p><span><b>Y</b>ES, THE NATION is in worse shape than you thought. The U.S. Postal Service has decided to let the people choose which visage of the King will adorn the inaugural stamp of the Legends of American Music series. After considering over 50 designs, the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee (this actually exists) submits for your approval two Elvises: the pelvic '50s \"Love Me Tender\" crooner and the fur-clad '70s Vegas denizen of \"Burning Love\" fame. Larry Agran will not be included.</span></p> <p><span>How will democracy run its course? Simple. Your friendly neighborhood post office will provide \"pre-adressed polling cards\" featuring the dueling Elvises. Just select the desired image, apply a stamp and send your ballot on its way. Vote early and often--\"polls\" open on April 6 and don't close until April 24. Ain't that America. (Ain't that Chicago.)</span></p> <p><span>This is no April Fools' joke. People in the Postal Service are genuinely excited about this. They don't have much else to be excited about, granted, but they're pulling out all the stops for this one. In February, Postmaster General (great name for a band) Anthony M. Frank unveiled the stamp designs on the Showroom stage of the Las Vegas Hilton, site of 839 sold-out performances by the King (someone in the Post Office actually counts these things).</span></p> <p><span><b>S</b>OME CRITICS DOUBT the wisdom of exalting such a legendary offender of controlled substance laws. But I have a different bone to pick. Why is the Postal Service violating its ban against portraying living Americans on postage? \"We've had tremendous interest in this particular stamp,\" says Frank frankly. And why this sudden burst of <i>glaspost?</i>? \"I wanted Elvis' fans to play an active role in the stamp selection process.\"</span></p> <p><span>And why not? Maybe the Postal Service is on to something. The results of the election will be announced in May, but don't you dare touch that dial. The King was always known for his encores.</span></p> <p><span>Try this on for size: if Bill Clinton slips between now and July, it's entirely possible that the Democrats could have a brokered convention in which an entirely new candidate could emerge victorious. Speculation has centered around Cuomo, Bentsen, Gephardt and Gore.</span></p> <p><span>But the self-imposed experts may be missing the boat. Allow me to be so bold as to suggest that the Democrats may very well spring for a braver choice: Elvis.</span></p> <p><span>The King would be a Democratic dream come true, the ideal candidate for an election year that's all shook up. He's a complete outsider, without any ties to Washington, S &amp; L's or Gennifer Flowers. In fact, he's dead. Or once was. You don't get more outside than that. He's wealthy enough to finance his own campaign. He plays well in the South. He can tailor his message to different audiences, as the stamps ably depict.</span></p> <p><span>Of course, the Dems would have to balance the ticket. Janis Joplin would fit the bill nicely. Or maybe Itzhak Perlman. An Elvis-Joplin (or even Elvis-Cuomo) ticket would galvanize the electorate as never before. Will past drug use sink the nominees? Chalk it up to youthful indiscretion, as President Bush did when explaining away Clarence Thomas' joint ventures.</span></p> <p><span>No one claims Elvis would be a shoo-in. Bush will put up a hard fight. He'll undoubtedly revert to the sleazy tactics of his '88 campaign. Perhaps he'll run commercials with Little Richard complaining that Elvis stole all his songs. Perhaps he'll run commercials with Willie Horton complaining that Elvis stole all <i>his</i> songs. And Elvis' foreign policy inexperience will certainly cost the Democrats votes.</span></p> <p><span>Will Elvis' grace land him a spot on the ballot in November? He is, by his own admission, the longest of long shots. But with antipolitician fever running rampant, anything can happen.

{"title": "Manufacturing My Game | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b> GET A LITTLE misty-eyed every time I walk into an old-time ballpark. The day I first caught a glimpse of Wrigley Field on a summer trip I took around the country to visit major league baseball stadiums, I immediately dropped to my knees and began to pray in the direction of the oldest thing in the ballpark: Cubs announcer Harry Caray.</span></p> <p><span>But of all the ballparks I saw that summer, the old, storied ones--Tiger Stadium in Detroit, Fenway Park, Yankee Stadium and even Baltimore's Memorial Stadium--were the most memorable. And I still cannot look at pictures of the old Comiskey Park, which stood on sainted ground in one of the worst areas of South Chicago for eighty years, without breaking down in tears.</span></p> <p><span>That is why I had such great hopes for Oriole Park at Camden Yards, the new home of the American League's Baltimore Orioles and the most ballyhooed new landmark since the Colossus at Rhodes.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>T FIRST BLUSH, Camden Yards was the stadium of my dreams. Sports columnists in the know promised it would bring the old-time charm back to ballpark design that Watergate-era concrete monoliths like Philadelphia's Veterans Stadium had stolen away.</span></p> <p><span>The new park, which was completed in time for yesterday's opening day game at a price of $106 million, even had the endorsement of the greatest baseball fan who ever lived, the late commissioner of baseball and former Yale president A. Bartlett Giamatti. Bart, when shown the plans for the proposed stadium, was heard to remark, \"once you build this, everyone will want one like it.\"</span></p> <p><span>Thinking of a summer trip to the new shrine, I began to research the stadium. And while Giamatti's statement is widely regarded as an endorsement, I like to think he, too, may have secretly known the truth: Camden is part of a conspiracy to conquer the Western world first by seducing it with manufactured history and then by numbing it with high-tech convenience.</span></p> <p><span>This conspiracy has long been in the making. What evidence I do have suggests that the conspirators first struck thirty years ago in Houston, Tex. It was there, in 1962, that, in the name of convenience, the Astrodome opened complete with glass roof and real grass.</span></p> <p><span>Like Camden Yards, it looked good on paper. But then they built the glass dome and a little too much light began to shine on the project. Players taking batting practice under the dome were so blinded by the glare that four glass panels had to be painted white. That, in turn, killed the grass. The grounds keeping compromise that artificially grew out of this crisis--Astroturf--haunts the national pastime to this day.</span></p> <p><span>A second and more toxic assault on baseball was waged in the late '60s and early '70s by the multi-purpose school, a group of well-intentioned but misguided municipal officials who widely spewed the sacrilege that football and baseball could be played in the same stadium.</span></p> <p><span>The poisoned fruits of their efforts are huge monuments to concrete that currently desecrate skylines in St. Louis, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and Cincinnati. The cheap Astroturf and symmetrical, cookie-cutter dimensions of these fields hurt both sports.</span></p> <p><span>They also have one other thing in common: they have eroded support for the grand old game--the most valuable treasure our nation possesses--among the newest generation of Americans. Recent surveys show that young Americans prefer basketball and football to baseball.</span></p> <p><span><b>C</b>AMDEN YARDS constitutes the greatest threat to the integrity of baseball since the designated hitter rule precisely because it is not the eyesore that the Astrodome or the concrete monoliths are.</span></p> <p><span>Camden is dangerous not only because it will fail to inspire the young but because it has charmed baseball purists--people who would throw themselves in front of any wrecking ball that came within a Mickey Mantle home run of a big league ballpark.</span></p> <p><span>The ballpark has the non-symmetrical dimensions that every baseball purist has built into their ideal stadium: 335 feet to left field, 319 right field, with a deeper power alley in right-center field than in left-center and a 25-foot tall wall in right. The deepest part of the ballpark isn't even dead center field--it's to the left of dead center, 410 feet away from home plate.</span></p> <p><span>But the dimensions are not what these poor, deceived purists like most about the new ballpark. They romanticize about its placement in the middle of Baltimore's rustic harbor district. Sixty feet on the other side of the right field fence stands the 94-year-old B &amp; O warehouse, the longest building on the East Coast and the ballpark's signature piece.</span></p> <p><span>And when the purists have finished gazing longingly at the historic red brick building, they can fix their eyes on the grass (home grown, one Oriole official reminded me, in Salisbury on Maryland's Eastern Shore) in right-center field, where the parents of legendary Yankees' slugger Babe Ruth once reportedly ran a tavern.</span></p> <p><span>But look beyond these surface bits of manufactured nostalgia and there seems to be a conspiracy at work.</span></p> <p><span>The sheer convenience of the entire place is designed to make fans soft. There is a 272-by-96 foot Sony Jumbo TRON screen so that the fans don't even have to watch the game live. The seats are designed five inches wider than those of other big league stadiums, a move clearly motivated by those who would profit from our sloth and obesity. There is also an extra half-foot of leg room, which promotes the exact sort of relaxed lounging that causes bad posture. The bullpens are elevated so fans do not need to strain themselves to see which pitchers are warming up.</span></p> <p><span>This conspiracy is so far-reaching that even the ballplayers are targets. They have warm-up rooms, video rooms, press rooms, locker rooms, training rooms, bed rooms. The clubhouses and training rooms are huge and plush, and the bullpens are wired for cable TV. All this extravagance can only hurt the quality of the game. What ballplayer will want to leave the warm waters of the clubhouse jacuzzi for the burning August sun?</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>HO IS BEHIND this conspiracy? Theories abound--the military-industrial complex, the money that has corrupted big-time politics, The Crimson business office--but no one is sure who's responsible.</span></p> <p><span>And just when we need it most, there is a dearth of brave politicians willing to stand up to the conspiracy. President Bush, the ultimate political wimp, gave his tacit support for the stadium by throwing out the first ball in yesterday's sold-out opener with the Cleveland Indians.</span></p> <p><span>Those who think that a Democrat in the White House would take action will also be disappointed. Though aides to Democratic presidential candidate Bill Clinton told me their man loves the game, I'm not convinced. Clinton is widely rumored to be a fan of the Houston Astros, a team that plays in the ultimate baseball horror--a domed stadium.</span></p> <p><span>Even joining a grass-roots movement won't make any difference. When I asked a press officer in the Santa Monica, Calif. office of Jerry Brown about the new stadium, he scornfully replied that the former California governor has more important things to worry about.</span></p> <p><span>Right. As if he has any chance of winning the nomination. Absent a nuclear Saddam or a beefed-up QRR requirement, fighting Camden should become the ultimate apple pie issue.</span></p> <p><span>But while baseball fans are seduced and softened by Camden, the conspiracy is planning similar new ballparks in Cleveland, Milwaukee, and Arlington, Tex. The sad truth is that unless fans fight to take it back, the game of the old Comiskey Park will one day be little more than ancient history.</span></p>"}
{"title": "It Matters Who Pays the Bills | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b>N 1990, Harvard took a principled stand on ending systematic discrimination in the U.S. military against lesbians, bisexuals and gays. Last week, it waffled.</span></p> <p><span>On Wednesday, the Faculty Council voted to dump its ultimatum to the Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) in favor an ageold stall tactic: they want to study the problem further. Specifically, the council gave its committee on ROTC an extension in preparing its report until next fall.</span></p> <p><span>\"There are lots of people who have views on the subject,\" said Pforzheimer University Professor Sidney Verba '53, chair of the ROTC committee. \"We wanted to make sure that we have heard from everyone.\"</span></p> <p><span>But Verba's invocation of open discussion is a distraction. The only issue is whether the University will tolerate discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.</span></p> <p><span>The council should immediately reverse its decision, and it should include other discriminatory scholarships as well. In fact, it's time that the University revamp the way it thinks about how students pay Harvard's bills.</span></p> <p><span><b>O</b>FFICIALLY, Harvard says it will not recognize organizations that engage in such discrimination. But by continuing to accept ROTC scholarship money, the University ignores this policy.</span></p> <p><span>Verba and the council never would have succeeded with the delay had the discrimination involved other minority groups. No study would be called for if ROTC denied its funds to, say, Blacks.</span></p> <p><span>By backing down from its ultimatum, the University offers a poor precedent for other schools and an empty threat to the Pentagon. MIT and the University of Wisconsin, among other colleges, have considered cutting ties to ROTC.</span></p> <p><span>But public schools such as Wisconsin often face state laws which require them to provide military education. It's up to private universities--especially those with Harvard's prestige--to take a stand.</span></p> <p><span>Since the debate reopened last fall, some have argued that Harvard should wait on American politicians to change the military's policy and that Harvard's action would be a meaningless waste of energy that would hurt poor and middle class students who rely on ROTC funds.</span></p> <p><span>They point to recent meetings by the Bush administration with a gay and lesbian group and Democratic presidential contender Bill Clinton's promising statement that he would end the ban on gays in the armed forces. The proper arena for the debate is the political one, they say.</span></p> <p><span>But this attitude ignores Harvard's influence over other schools and the fact that if no schools accepted the discriminatory scholarships, ROTC would be forced to change. Besides, the real issue is that Harvard has the right--and the responsibility--to make ethical decisions about the sources of its funds.</span></p> <p><span>As Harvard backpeddles, the military can both continue its policy (until at least 1997 at the College) and use rationales provided by the University to postpone change.</span></p> <p><span>What about those students who could not afford to attend Harvard without ROTC funds?</span></p> <p><span>The answer to the high costs of college education is not to accept money from discriminatory organizations.</span></p> <p><span>In fact, to be consistent, Harvard should refuse to accept money from all organizations that discriminate on the basis of sex, religion, race <i>or</i> sexual orientation. That means nixing those \"prizes\" for descendants of white students from old New England families and any church-based scholarships.</span></p> <p><span>Now the University incorporates such scholarships into financial aid packages, often providing grants and low-interest loans as part of such packages. In theory, admissions are \"need-blind\" since Harvard helps students pay what they cannot afford.</span></p> <p><span>Refusing to accept discriminatory scholarships would increase Harvard's financial burden to provide need-blind admissions. But the ideal is worth the cost. The University should make it clear to all prospective students that Harvard will cover costs that discriminatory funding might otherwise pay.</span></p> <p><span>In other words, no students--not even the poorest--should be able to say that because Harvard opposes bias against homosexuals (or anyone else) by ending discriminatory scholarships, the University effectively prevents them from attending.</span></p> <p><span>And the need-blind admissions funds should be generous enough to live up to their name. Some students complain that Harvard offers their parents impossible choices. Sure, those students say, they could accept the financial aid packages offered them--but only if their parents remortgaged their homes.</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>HAT ABOUT race-based scholarships for minorities? And how about class-based monies for poor students? Recently, the Bush administration said that minority funding is illegal because it discriminates on the basis of race.</span></p> <p><span>In a narrow sense, they are correct. Indeed, this conclusion would flow from my general standard of nondiscrimination as described above. But draconian meritocratic standards do not account for past and present bias. Minorities who face the psychological, economic and social barriers of societal bias cannot be held to the Bushies' level-playing-field argument. Thus minority scholarships should be allowed.</span></p> <p><span>Still, giving a scholarship to a Black son of a Harvard grad from Andover and not to a poor white from a rural working class family (Who faces similar psychological, economic and social barriers) seems skewed.</span></p> <p><span>So if Harvard is truly to increase fairness, it should in addition to allowing minority funds accept such class-based scholarships as those given by unions or corporations for children of workers.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>ND ALL THIS should be done soon. The Faculty Council voted nearly two years ago to levy the ultimatum against the Department of Defense. That should have been plenty of time to come up with a funding plan to allow needy ROTC students to attend the school (i.e., deepening the need-blind admissions coffers).</span></p> <p><span>The other major issue--what to do about the loss of ideological diversity accrued when some students choose ROTC over Harvard--seems like a specious one.</span></p> <p><span>First of all, as an Undergraduate Council study found last fall, only a few ROTC students would have chosen not to attend Harvard <i>solely</i> because it had banned ROTC completely. In other words, given University funding to make up for what would be unacceptable ROTC money, most would have come to Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>Of those who would not, their loss is a price I'm willing to pay to oppose the military's biased policy. It's not these particular ROTC students' ideology I oppose--but if they positively cannot attend Harvard just because they won't be able to play soldier here, I can stand to lose them. Opposing vicious state-imposed discrimination is more important.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard has dragged its feet long enough on the ROTC issue. And now is the time to reject other discriminatory scholarships as well. Otherwise, Harvard's commitment to fairness will be little more than window dressing.</span></p>"}

It is his uncanny public rapport, some say, that causes voters to doubt the substance behind the frontrunner.</span></p> <p><span>Clinton's victory party last night was yet another rehearsed stage performance. At the posh Ritz Club, a 100-screen video wall flashed red, white and blue until Clinton arrived on the scene.</span></p> <p><span>As the Arkansas governor stepped on stage, the video wall was mechanically raised, replaced by the backdrop of a two-story American flag.</span></p> <p><span>The high-tech show provided an appropriate introduction for Clinton's victory speech, which was lengthy and filled with references to liberal heroes Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.</span></p> <p><span>Brown, known for his 1-800 number and grassroots campaign, chose a less formal site--the headquarters of Hospital Workers' Union Local 1199 on the outskirts of Times Square in the heart of the Big Apple.</span></p> <p><span>An ordinary room and simple platform was enough for the former California governor. A bunch of balloons and a few posters scattered around the \"auditorium\" were the only ornaments--besides the plastic Lady Liberty.</span></p> <p><span>Likening himself to John Paul Jones by saying that he has \"just begun to fight,\" Brown declared that yesterday's primary was just the beginning of his race for the Democratic nomination. The crowd ate it up, carrying out a poster wishing the bachelor candidate a happy 54th birthday.</span></p> <p><span>In his \"victory\" speech last night, Brown congratulated rivals Clinton and Paul E. Tsongas because \"it is not a time for mean-spiritedness.\" He spoke briefly, but included praise for his competitors, a call for party unity and, of course, his infamous 1-800 number. The toll-free hotline was also prominently displayed on a banner behind him as well on T-shirts and buttons on sale in the lobby.</span></p> <p><span>Clinton's celebration attracted an upscale, professional crowd, enjoying cocktails served uniformed waitresses.</span></p> <p><span>Brown's party-goers were distinctively Budweiser and blue jeans. The crowd did not hesitate to ridicule Bush's sickness in Japan by making vomiting gestures en masse to a bank of television cameras when prompted by a campaign official.</span></p> <p><span><i>Brian D.

{"title": "Post-Coup Peru | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>A</b>S PRESIDENT Alberto Fujimoro suspended democracy in Peru Monday, one could hear Americans across the country asking the burning question:  Peru?  Where the hell is Peru?</span></p> <p><span>Well, it was first found by Francisco Pizarro, an illiterate swineherd.  It's west of Brazil and north of Chile.  First faltering democracy on your right.  You can't miss it.</span></p> <p><span>It's a messy society, where institutions are weak and don't mean much to the people.  There's not much consensus on the system (which was democratic until Monday), and most real authority lies with groups outside of the formal structures of government--like the vicious Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) guerrillas.</span></p> <p><span>And the economy is a basket case, boasting the second lowest per capita GNP in Latin America.  Despite impressive metal resources, the only time foreign investors got really excited about Peru was during the 19th century, when 80 percent of government revenues were derived from the export of guano (which is, well, bird shit).</span></p> <p><span>In fact, there were widespread rumors in 1989 that the only reason why the military hadn't pulled a coup yet was that they could not deal with the sliding economy.</span></p> <p><span>Despite the economy, Peru managed to look pretty democratic until the government fell apart.  The 1979 constitution is a model of liberalism--it allows for a diverse and noisy political spectrum that keeps politics lively.  And since 1975, both Spanish and the native Quechua have been the official languages.</span></p> <p><span>The problem, as Tina Rosenberg of the Overseas Development Council has argued, is that the commitment to democracy and fairness was largely formal.  Money and connections still mean more than formal rights.  Civilian control over the military exists in name only, and the government has not had the guts to send a single Peruvian soldier to jail for their many human rights abuses.</span></p> <p><span>Result:  a government by, for and of rich white people, seen with general contempt by everyone else.  Result:  everyone else seeks representation outside the system, which in extreme cases means casting their lot with the urban-based Marxists of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement--or, even worse, with the notorious Sendero Luminoso.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE MOST VIABLE force in Peruvian politics has been, traditionally, its hugely popular left-wing political party, APRA, or the Alianze Popular Revolucionaria Americana for short.  (APRA is also sometimes known as the Partido Apristo Peruano--that is, PAP.)</span></p> <p><span>It started out as violent and seriously revolutionary in the 1920s, under the leadership of your standard Latin American charismatic type, Haya de la Torre--known affectionately as \"el Jefe.\"  EI Jefe's messianic Marxism and anti-imperialism found a receptive audience in underdeveloped Peru, forging what Peruvians call APRA's \"mistica.\"</span></p> <p><span>El Jefe's firebreathing brand of leftist politics soon led APRA into perpetual and sometimes violent conflict with the conservative government, which in its turn carried out in 1932 a rather horrendous massacre of Apristas in Trujillo.  By the 1950s, APRA had finally calmed down, and spent the next two decades sucking up to the conservative establishment.  But there was a sense that when it gave up on el Jefe's revolt, APRA had sold out, lost its soul.</span></p> <p><span>With the military still leery of APRA, a more moderate politician, Fernando Belaunde Terry of the Accion Popular, came to power.  Belaunde is the Herbert Hoover of Peruvian politics--the economy took one look at him and promptly plunged into chaotic inflation.  When he messily nationalized an oil company and the exteme left started clearing its throat in the wings, the military threw him out of power and took over themselves.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HEN IT GOT really weird.  What you might expect to be the usual sordid rightist military junta actually went on to implement, of all things, an APRA progressive reform agenda.  The regime courted the Church, sympathized with the landless peasants, stressed social justice and generally confused the life out of every political scientist in the world.  In 1980 the brass realized Peruvians were getting sick of them and returned power to--of all people--the befuddled Belaunde.</span></p> <p><span>Guess what?  The economy, still allergic to Belaunde, went blooey again.  When the kinder, gentler APRA went head to head with Belaunde in 1985, it thrashed him.  APRA's Alan Garcia, a populist who was liked but not as revered as el Jefe had been, campaigned on such perennially crowd-pleasing issues as screwing the International Monetary Fund and not paying off Peru's debts.</span></p> <p><span>He won (the first kosher transition of government since the 1940s), and then proceeded to blunder on his economic program, boldly seizing the banks and in the process terrifying the establishment.  At the same time, hyperinflation raged (prices went up literally 200 million percent) and unemployment soared.</span></p> <p><span>Again, as usual, everyone was distinctly unimpressed with the government and the system.  Protest voting brought in Fujimoro in an election characterized above all by the rejection of anyone who had ever had anything whatsoever to do with the Lima government, including APRA.</span></p> <p><span>Fujimoro, known as \"the Karate Kid\" (no, \"Fujimoro\" is not an Iberian surname), has faced an increasingly bloody war with the Sendero Luminoso, costing 25,000 lives so far.</span></p> <p><span>Lima has not found a decent way of fighting Sendero.  The army has taken to shooting up whole villages that are suspected of harboring Senderistas, which doesn't endear the government to anyone.  \"Civilian response has been to ignore it,\" one U.S. official told The New York Times.  \"The military response has been to blow everyone away.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>LL OF THIS leaves two legacies for Peruvian politics.  First, steadily decreasing legitimacy, to the point that now even APRA isn't respected.  (That didn't stop Fujimoro from jailing or harassing the top Apristas, although Garcia himself may have escaped.)</span></p> <p><span>Second, APRA left a taste for messianic solutions to the endemic problems of underdevelopment and poverty that plague Peru.  Sendero plays off of that quite handily--indeed, some Apristas have a certain grudging sympathy for Sendero.  After all, they considered violent solutions too.</span></p> <p><span>Still, Sendero is in a class by itself.  With a human rights record that makes one's head spin, Sendero's leader Abimale Guzman Reynoso aims not just at revolution, but at a society modeled explicitly on China during the Cultural Revolution.</span></p> <p><span>If it takes a million deaths to do it, that's just fine with Sendero.  The only nice thing about Sendero is that it's not getting much help--yet--from the outside.  Guzman reviled the Soviet Union, and China hasn't stepped in to help out these Maoist purists (remember, Deng Xiaoping got purged a few times during the Cultural Revolution).</span></p> <p><span>Now, Fujimoro may have a repeat of 1968 in mind--pull a putsch, but don't behave like a putschist.  Such progressive authoritarianism is sort of like smoking a joint but not inhaling.  Bad idea.  Fujimoro's best bet against Sendero is U.S. support (if Bush were wise, he'd think about debt relief instead of just throwing aid dollars into Peru), and Peruvian popular support.</span></p> <p><span>Both will evaporate in some haste if Fujimoro goes authoritarian.  Instead of a dictatorship--even a humane one, if that's what he has in mind--he ought to think in terms of presenting himself as an alternative to Sendero.</span></p> <p><span>This can work.  When the Catholic Church or APRA offers itself as a viable political option, Senderistas run scared.  (Actually, that's not entirely true.  Sendero has also been known to react by shooting nuns.)</span></p> <p><span>And if it expects to gain any support, Fujimoro's military should stop doing stupid and brutal things to Peruvians.  Fujimoro may also have been forced into this by the military, who have gained power in the struggle with Sendero.  In other words, returning to democracy, fragile as it is, may be a tall order.</span></p> <p><span>But ultimately, that is what must be done.  Only a government with legitimacy--a Peruvian oddity--can stand up to Sendero and the poverty and desperation it feeds on.</span></p> <p><span><b>Despite having a horrible economy, Peru has managed to maintain at least the appearance of democracy... ...until last Monday.  Now a civil-military coup will destroy even that.  Bad idea.</b></span></p>"}

{"title": "Broken Brokered Dreams | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>J</b>ERRY BROWN isn't the only one who has lost faith in the system.</span></p> <p><span>Three days after the New York primary, many democratic politicians still believe that only a brokered convention will save the party's chances in November.</span></p> <p><span>Some are waiting for the next high heel to drop on Bill Clinton's campaign. Some point to low voter turnout and the success of non candidate Paul E. Tsongas this week as proof of a dissatisfied electorate. Others see a compromise candidate as the only way to weaken the divisions among Democrats that inevitably help the Republican party. Unhappy with Clinton, annoyed at Brown--what's a superdelegate to do?</span></p> <p><span>Never mind that after Tuesday's primary, Clinton has almost 60 percent of the delegates needed for the nomination. Never mind that broad hints dropped all through the campaign have yet to produce an alternative candidate. Never mind that yesterday, even Tsongas, who received 29 percent of the New York vote without campaigning, rejected calls to reenter the race.</span></p> <p><span>Never mind all the good reasons to sigh with resignation and begin helping nominee-apparent Clinton to run for president. These panicked Democrats are still trying to keep enough superdelegates uncommitted until the convention so that they can manipulate some votes, give a few good sound bites, wave their magic wands and, in a puff of smoke from their smoke-filled rooms, produce a safe middle-of-the-road candidate--Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, for example.</span></p> <p><span><b>O</b>NE WORRIED politician, Rep. Don Edwards of California, lost no time. The day after the primary he called 17 other uncommitted representative into his office and urged them to stay that way.</span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile, reports in The New York Times yesterday suggested that the Clinton campaign, aided by Democratic National Committee Chair Ronald H. Brown, has begun actively wooing uncommitted superdelegates. (Superdelegates, by the way, are the 600 or so party and elected officials who automatically become delegates and who can remain uncommitted until the convention.)</span></p> <p><span>Enthusiasm for a brokered convention was apparent even before the primary. Some especially cynical New York lawmakers suggested voting for Brown as a way to embarrass Clinton and force the race to stay wide open until the convention. It was widely predicted that a sizable delegate count for brown would damage clinton enough to make a convention-drafted candidate a viable possibility.</span></p> <p><span>And while Clinton garnered enough support in New York to ward off any direct assaults to his credibility one exit poll showed that 66 percent of New York Democratic voters were dissatisfied with the current choices. To interpret that as a mandate for anachronistic power brokers to produce the Teflon candidate, however, is a serious misreading of voter sentiment.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>T SHOULD come as no shock that voters, in New York as elsewhere, are an unhappy lot. The primary campaign there was distinguished by the kind of media feeding frenzy that makes candidates recognizable only by their blood. The candidates themselves have become depressingly familiar to the electorate. The desire for something new and different isn't surprising.</span></p> <p><span>The truth, however, is that no white knight is about to come save the Democratic party. And the public is unlikely to be enthusiastic about anyone who comes riding up on a steed this last in the game. Americans may have mixed feelings about charisma, but they routinely dismiss people who don't stick it out and fight. Clinton is admired for his staying power, if for noting else.</span></p> <p><span>A drafted candidate would face the perception that he (and it would be a he) sat and watched while others did all the work. We have enough Monday-morning quarterbacks.</span></p> <p><span>And anyone who thinks the voters are just waiting for a candidate hand-picked by the Democratic congressional elite hasn't pad much attention to voter response to an otherwise tame scandal in the House bank. With congressional prestige at an all-time low, for these members of Congress of to say they are better suited to pick a popular candidate than voters is inane. As Bentsen himself might say, \"That dawg won't hunt.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HIS fascination with some mythical super-candidate also ignores the fundamental reality of presidential campaigns. It is a brutal process, exposing candidates to intense scrutiny of everything they ever said, did or thought. A new candidate will face that no less than Clinton has, but will he face it with more at stake.</span></p> <p><span>One of the biggest fallacies in the drive for a brokered convention is the idea that any untried candidate is better than one who is battle weary. The perfect candidate today may look like a public relations disaster tomorrow.</span></p> <p><span>When Thomas S. Foley became speaker of the house, a <i>New Yorker</i> profile referred to him as \"the best President who would never run.\" Few would still agree with that assessment.</span></p> <p><span>The New York primary was the last serious test of Clinton's legitimacy. Like it or not, he passed. Failing any major catastrophe in the next three months, the governor from Arkansas will be the 1992 Democratic nominee. It is long past time for the doubters and grumblers to deal with it.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Bush Is Still Gagging | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>F</b>RIDAY MARCH 20 was a bad day for women and pro-choice advocates. President Bush, in making his bid for re-election, successfully managed to sidestep the controversial abortion issue by making meaningless compromises. He placated a large segment of the electorate by making voters think he is on their side, when in reality he is doing his utmost to frustrate their efforts to guarantee the right to abortion.</span></p> <p><span>Bush has shown yet again that he has no backbone or true conviction. In recent months he has been an ardent pro-lifer, responding in part to the harsh attacks mounted by his ultra-conservative challenger, Patrick Buchanan. He has supported the movement that is gaining steam throughout the country to reverse <i>Roe v. Wade.</i></span></p> <p><span>Yet he was apparently afraid that he was alienating vocal and powerful pro-choice voters, and that there are enough of them out there to jeopardize his chances for re-election.</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>HEN INSTITUTED in 1998 through an executive order written by Bush, the gag rule did not permit medical professionals in federally funded clinics to speak of abortion as an option to their patients. By doing this, Bush hoped to gain more conservative support.</span></p> <p><span>On March 20, though, Bush flip-flopped and modified the rule. In its new form, the gag rule allows certified doctors to mention abortion as an option to their patients, but they are not allowed to refer them to doctors or clinic which perform abortions. Nurses are still not allowed to talk about abortion with patients.</span></p> <p><span>Bush hoped that changing the gag order would convince women voters that he is, in fact, a president who could respond to their needs and concerns. But in fact Bush's actions prove the opposite.</span></p> <p><span>Bush's tactic is to \"kick sand in the public's eye,\" as a New York Times staff editorial charged. It is a simple ploy to gain more votes, not the beginning of a program to help women protect their right to an abortion.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE PARTIAL lifting of the gag rule might seem like a significant step. The problem is that it does not go far enough. Many of the limitations on the kind of medical treatment a doctor can advise in a federal clinic are still in place.</span></p> <p><span>Doctors can now advise women on all relevant procedures, but they are not allowed to refer them to clinics that perform abortions. Most women already know what an abortion is. What they need help with is deciding if it is medically advisable--and if it is, finding someone to perform the operation.</span></p> <p><span>In modifying the gag rule, the President aimed not to offer better medical care to pregnant women, but to secure more votes.</span></p> <p><span>It doesn't help women to know all of their theoretical options, only to have a doctor refuse to refer them to a competent and safe abortion clinic.</span></p> <p><span>In addition, in small rural towns there is a paucity of certified doctors. Most pregnant women see nurses, who are still forbidden to talk about abortion. The new modification does nothing to help these women and in fact specifically discriminates against them.</span></p> <p><span>Women who are poor are especially hard hit. They can often use up the money they have, traveling around the country, in a desperate attempt to find a doctor willing to perform an abortion. The number of doctors who refuse to perform abortions is rising at a rapid rate, making it increasingly difficult for women with limited savings to find one before it is too late.</span></p> <p><span>In the end, many women have unwanted children and have no money left to support them. The New York Times reports that half the students at the John Hopkins School of Medicine say they will not perform abortions when they are doctors. This is indicative of the pace at which our country is moving towards a reversal of <i>Roe v. Wade,</i> and the increased difficulty women have in getting an abortion.</span></p> <p><span><b>B</b>USH'S MODIFICATION of the gag rule does not substantially change it. Pregnant women are still in a vulnerable position when they have to go to federally funded clinics to ask for medical advice. Bush's motive in changing the gag rule was not to offer better medical care to these women. His only aim was to secure more votes.</span></p> <p><span>American voters are skeptical about every politician's motives this election year. We must not let ourselves be fooled into complacency by Bush's deceptions--no matter how much he shields his waffling as standard policy changes.</span></p> <p><span>Clearly if Bush feels he is under enough pressure from pro-choice groups, and he wants a chance of winning these voters, he will attempt to please them.</span></p> <p><span>The electorate must show Bush that he has not yet done enough to win the confidence of the voters to whom he is pandering. If he wants to trade votes for abortion rights, so be it.</span></p> <p><span>Those of us who value a woman's right to choose abortion can use that to our advantage by speaking out and letting him know he has not yet done enough. We are not so naive as to think that Bush isn't just making idle campaign promises like \"no new taxes\" that will be forgotten or changed once he is in office again.</span></p> <p><span>March 20 may have been a bad day for pro-choice advocates, but if we don't let ourselves be fooled by Bush, then maybe we can finally force him to make some real concessions.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Don't Go Wobbly | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>U</b>NTIL A COUPLE of weeks ago, George Bush had been in hasty retreat from his internationalist ways. With Patrick J. Buchanan bellowing all over New Hampshire for \"America First\" and the democrats selling \"George Bush: The Anywhere But America Tour\" T-shirts, the new f-word had become \"foreign affairs.\"</span></p> <p><span>But then last month a voice from the past, belonging to Richard M. Nixon, fired off a damaging memo attacking the president for letting election-year posturing stand in the way of pursuing America's interests and ideals. (And Nixon, of all people should know.)</span></p> <p><span>Nixon said that if Western politicians--read: President Bush--failed to act decisively to help Boris N. Yeltsin weather Russia's economic and political typhoon, the refrain (or witch hunt?) of 1990s politics would be \"Who lost Russia.\"</span></p> <p><span>Nixon's warning to Bush had the same effect as margaret Theater's \"George, this is no time to go wobbly\" comment from the early stages of the Persian Gulf crisis: it motivated the president to act presidential.</span></p> <p><span>Earlier this month, with great fanfare and broad pundit support, he announced that the United States, along with some of its Western allies, had agreed to a $24 billion aid package for the former Soviet Union. This is great news for Russia, and also for America, which has shown itself not to be as shallow and self-absorbed as Buchanan wants it to be.</span></p> <p><span>President Bush has shown courage and decisiveness in going ahead with the aid plan, and the pundits are proclaiming that his self-imposed exile from the international scene may finally be over. But as he demonstrated at the end of the Gulf War, Bush is always prone to wobbliness.</span></p> <p><span>And if he now returns to his normal stance of \"prudence without purpose\" as Bill Clinton calls, it, he will have missed perhaps the last chance to help the other great democratic transformation of the 1990s succeed. If only Nixon would come out again from his political grave to frame this question: \"who lost South Africa\"?</span></p> <p><span><b>O</b>N MARCH 17, in a national referendum with an 85 percent voter turnout, South African whites voted overwhelmingly (69 percent for, 31 against) to end the system of apartheid. This was no political gimmick on the part of the governing National Party, nor was it a merely grudging acceptance of reality.</span></p> <p><span>The vote was an enthusiastic embrace of the future, and it showed a real commitment to a revolution in society that goes far beyond anything Bill \"Fundamental Charge\" Clinton or Jerry \"Take Your Government Back\" Brown has proposed for our country.</span></p> <p><span>So eager were they to cast their \"JA\" votes that thousands of whites lined up outside polling places even before they opened at 7 a.m. One woman who was experiencing labor pains insisted on being driven to the polls before going to the hospital.</span></p> <p><span>Not only whites, but a majority in all racial groups voted for a unified, multiracial South African democracy. The Indian and mixed-blood populations have long supported integration with whites, and many observers believe that if given the chance, they would vote for President F.W. de Klerk and the National Party.</span></p> <p><span>And while some Blacks want to \"throw the white bastards out,\" there are sings of moderation in their aims as well.</span></p> <p><span>A survey in the middle of 1991 found that 52 percent of Blacks were \"very satisfied\" with the present government, and another 30 percent were \"satisfied\" (those numbers are probably higher today.)</span></p> <p><span>And even the once-firebreathing African National Congress (ANC) has moderated its goal of pursuing state socialism to one of creating a multiparty democracy and \"mixed economy\" with a healthy private sector.</span></p> <p><span>So there is hope for South Africa's future. Except for a handful of right-and left-wing extremists, most South Africans want to live and work together in the new South Africa.</span></p> <p><span>But, as in the case of the former Soviet Union, South Africa needs help. The economy, once Africa's strongest (in spite of the horrendously inefficient apartheid system) is reeling under the blows of Western economic sanctions, Western divestment, desertion by South African capital and skilled professionals, and a population growth rate that far outstrips growth in the gross rational product.</span></p> <p><span>Furthermore, AIDS has spread uncontrollably across the country. It is estimated that by the year 2000, 7.5 million South Africans will be HIV positive (South African's population is a little over 32 million.)</span></p> <p><span>To make matters worse, the worst drought in a century has hit southern Africa this year--famine threatens to engulf the entire region. Normally a big exporter of food, South Africa will have to import four million tons of corn this year, or about two-thirds of its consumption.</span></p> <p><span><b>S</b>O THE CHOICE for American foreign policy is clear. We can support South Africa now, helping them chart a course toward joining the club of newly democratic, economically advancing nations. Or we can sit back and watch as it deindustrializes and collapses into Lebanon-style tribal warfare, pulling the rest of southern Africa down with it. The U.S. has made an enormous investment for change in South Africa. Have we become so penny-pinching that we refuse to make the final effort to bring democracy to the nation.?</span></p> <p><span>Some steps should be taken immediately. The American government has already lifted most sanctions against South Africa, but some loan restrictions remain in place. The U.S. should lift these and should send major economic and technical assistance, as well as food aid, as soon as possible.</span></p> <p><span>Furthermore, Washington should lean on its allies to do the same. But the federal government is only a part of the story. States and municipalities who have passed their own sanctions against South Africa should annul these as well. And government officials and activists alike should encourage American businesses which divested in the 1980s to go back to South Africa and set up shop again.</span></p> <p><span>Such economic support will give us leverage in South African politics. But we should not try to use this leverage to benefit any side in the negotiations on a new constitution. Such heavy-handed tactics could only help to jeopardize the fragile spirit of accommodation and reconciliation now taking hold.</span></p> <p><span>In his speech announcing the \"yes\" vote in the referendum, President de Klerk said, \"It doesn't often happen that in one generation a nation gets the opportunity to rise above itself.\" The U.S. has already risen above itself twice during the Bush administration alone: in repelling Saddam Hussein from Kuwait, and in creating a Marshall-type aid program for the consolidation of democracy in Russia.</span></p> <p><span>Now a third such opportunity, to promote political and economic stability in South Africa, has arisen. George, this is no time to go wobbly.</span></p>"}

Most issues are mentioned only in soundbites or promises, with little substantive debate.</span></p> <p><span>The state of education in America is one of those issues.</span></p> <p><span>Candidates in both parties say education reform is a fundamental tenet of their platforms. They agree that education is central to curing the nation's long-term economic ills.</span></p> <p><span>But professors at the Graduate School of Education say that education issues have received very little attention this election year.</span></p> <p><span>\"It's hard to see it in the newspapers at all,\" says Professor of Education Jerome T. Murphy.</span></p> <p><span>Education scholars agree that the lingering recession has pushed education down on the national agenda.</span></p> <p><span>\"Across the country, social issues, including education, have taken a back seat to the economy and the recession,\" says Arthur Levine, former president of Bradford College and a senior lecturer at the Ed School.</span></p> <p><span>Levine adds that education is at the bottom of the ladder of social issues, beneath health care concerns and prison reform.</span></p> <p><span>Although people recognize the importance of education, the issues that are at the forefront of discussion are those that affect the people most directly, he says.</span></p> <p><span>\"The position of education in this election is relative to the condition of the nation,\" says Levine.</span></p> <p><span>Other scholars, including Professor of Education and Social Structure Nathan Glazer, say education's lack of exposure is less indicative of the electorate's concerns and more a result of the campaigns themselves.</span></p> <p><span>\"This is not the kind of campaign in which the issues are playing a big role,\" says Glazer. \"I have not been impressed by the relative weight given to issues in this election.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>O</b>F THE FOUR ACTIVE CANDIDATES for the presidency, conservative Patrick J. Buchanan has the least substantive platform on education.</span></p> <p><span>As a former public official, his record on education is nearly non-existent.</span></p> <p><span>His campaign position paper devotes only three paragraphs to education.</span></p> <p><span>His main stand is his support for \"school choice,\" a system in which parents may use government-funded vouchers to send to their children to public, private or parochial schools. But Buchanan provides no details about how such a system would work.</span></p> <p><span>He also calls for increased parental, church and community involvement in education, as well as a merit-based hiring and pay system for teachers.</span></p> <p><span>Buchanan advocates a constitutional amendment to allow voluntary prayer, Bible reading and religious instruction in public schools.</span></p> <p><span>\"A nation where the Ten Commandments are ordered out of classrooms and where 14-year-old girls are given condoms and told to go practice `safe sex' has lost its moral compass,\" he says.</span></p> <p><span>Buchanan, whose campaign slogan is \"America First,\" also stresses a greater emphasis on U.S. history and English and American literature.</span></p> <p><span><b>L</b>IKE BUCHANAN, Democratic contender Edmund G. Brown Jr. has few detailed proposals for education reform.</span></p> <p><span>The former California governor has spoken frequently--especially on college campuses--about his plan to replace college tuition loans with scholarships and work-study grants.</span></p> <p><span>Brown says he would also increase spending on education programs and establish a \"civilian conservation corps\" where young people can develop skills.</span></p> <p><span>He calls his entire proposal \"a 21st-century educational plan.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"The purpose of education is not to produce a new generation of robots to compete with the Japanese. Education should be broadly based in literature, art, music, and the sciences. We should ... invest in accessible education as an unalienable right,\" Brown says in his campaign literature.</span></p> <p><span>Echoing the views of many Democrats, Brown says he will immediately push for full funding of programs such as Head Start, designed to give preschool children better preparation through a combination of school and health programs.</span></p> <p><span>Brown's record on education during his two-term tenure as governor of California receives mixed reviews.</span></p> <p><span>His harshest critics are at the university level. During his term, Brown froze faculty salaries arguing that professors were compensated by what he called \"psychic income.\" Several officials at the University of California system have criticized Brown's leadership, some arguing that he made the system worse.</span></p> <p><span>By most accounts, public education in the state weakened during his years as governor. As the public voted in a referendum to pass a major tax-cut, funding dropped. During his tenure, California slipped from 18th to 31st nationally in per pupil school financing.</span></p> <p><span>The governor threatened to constrain school budgets in an effort to inspire reform. He reportedly answered \"I don't know yet\" when asked what he had in mind.</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>HILE BROWN presses for increased funding for education, one striking aspect of President Bush's education program is the modest increase in funding.</span></p> <p><span>Instead of more money, the Bush administration highlights more experimentation with education programs and has endorsed \"school choice\" that allow parents flexibility in selecting schools--public or private--and introduce competition into the public school system.</span></p> <p><span>The administration is basically saying it can do more with less.</span></p> <p><span>His four-point program, titled \"America 2000: Excellence in Education,\" seeks to set national educational goals and develop a community-wide strategy to reach them, establishes a \"report card\" to measure schools, and supports the creation and funding of \"New American Schools\" that experiment with innovation.</span></p> <p><span>His new Secretary of Education, former Tennessee governor Lamar Alexander, has already earned the respect of Democrats and Republicans inside and outside of Washington.</span></p> <p><span>Bush sees education as the vehicle for a more competitive global economy. He writes, \"A better educated workforce is essential to America's economic growth and world competitiveness.\"</span></p> <p><span>The president also proposes an increase of funding for Head Start of $600 million.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>RKANSAS GOVERNOR Bill Clinton's most dramatic education proposal is a plan to double federal spending on education, concentrating resources on the inner city and rural areas.</span></p> <p><span>Clinton also supports a \"service option\" for students to pay off tuition loans--a work-study program geared toward public service.</span></p> <p><span>Clinton says he would also create apprenticeship programs for high school graduates not planning to attend college as well as adult education programs for those without high school diplomats.</span></p> <p><span>The Democratic frontrunner receives a generally positive review for his record on education. He has been credited with turning around the Arkansas school system, or at least preventing it from slipping further behind.</span></p> <p><span>A 1978 University of Florida study concluded that Arkansas schools were the worst in the nation. In 1989 Time magazine named Arkansas as one of two states whose schools improved the most in the 1980s.</span></p> <p><span>While high school graduation rates improved during that period, standardized test scores, per-pupil expenditures and teacher pay remain among the nation's worst.</span></p> <p><span>His initiatives are a mix of old and new. He increased state funding for Head Start and set academic achievement standards. He also pushed through a proposal to test teachers for competency and fine parents who tolerated student truancy.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>LTHOUGH OPINION is far from unanimous at the Education School, most professors interviewed seemed inclined to support Clinton given the present alternatives.</span></p> <p><span>And some scholars said that as far as education issues are concerned, Clinton would be the clear favorite.</span></p> <p><span>\"His background of knowledge in education is unmatched,\" says Murphy, a former associate dean at the graduate school.</span></p> <p><span>\"One would expect an understanding of schools from him,\" adds Levine.</span></p> <p><span>Professor of Education Gary Orfield, whose research has focused on education opportunities for minorities, says education is an \"important secondary issue\" and playing an increasingly more important role in the Clinton campaign.</span></p> <p><span>Orfield also says that the candidate's wife, Hilary Clinton, is a plus. She is currently the general counsel for the Children's Defense Fund.</span></p> <p><span>Scholars interviewed were also disappointed with President Bush's performance as the self-proclaimed \"Education President.\"</span></p> <p><span>Levine praises Bush for experimenting with \"good ideas,\" but says his \"American 2000\" program is simply inadequate.</span></p> <p><span>\"It is very simple answer to very complex questions,\" says Levine, a higher education specialist.</span></p> <p><span>Orfield agrees. He says the president has set high goals but has devoted few resources to meeting them.</span></p> <p><span>Although Bush has made substantial efforts in areas such as financial aid and Head Start, several professors believe more money is necessary.</span></p> <p><span>Harold Howe II, a senior lecturer on education who has headed a variety of foundations and national commissions, says Bush should put more into Head Start.</span></p> <p><span>\"Good research has shown that it works,\" says Howe.</span></p> <p><span>Insurgent candidates Brown and Buchanan also receive poor reviews from professors interviewed.</span></p> <p><span>\"Brown's record in California was not impressive,\" says Levine, adding that the candidate was less supportive of the university system there than former governor Ronald Reagan.</span></p> <p><span>But Buchanan would be even worse, the scholars say. Because he advocates a minimist federal role, Buchanan would almost certainly reduce federal funding for schools.</span></p> <p><span>\"I have absolutely no idea what [Buchanan] wishes to do on education--and I would suspect that he has none as well,\" says Murphy.</span></p> <p><span>Neither Brown nor Buchanan are \"education presidents,\" says Orfield. \"Neither of them has run a coherent campaign. So far, they are just full of slogans,\" he says.</span></p> <p><span><b>S</b>EVERAL IMPORTANT education issues are not being discussed and examined thoroughly enough this year, professors say.</span></p> <p><span>Glazer points out that too many candidates and interest groups are simply calling for more money.</span></p> <p><span>\"The easiest thing to say is, `We need more money,'\" says Glazer. But education as a whole, he says, has sufficient funding. The focus needs to shift from how much money is spent toward how that money is spent, he argues.</span></p> <p><span>Different professors point to different programs. Financial aid programs, Head Start, school choice and programs designed to assist economically disadvantaged children are mentioned regularly.</span></p> <p><span>Setting national standards and the quality of teachers is a concern of a number of professors, as is the touchy subject of school desegregation and the debate over whether resources should go to the poor or the middle class.</span></p> <p><span>But some professors emphasize that \"the education deficit\" is only a symptom of a greater social problem.</span></p> <p><span>\"It is not as simple as this: if you fix the schools, you will fix the kids,\" says Howe.</span></p> <p><span>\"If a child does not live in a decent house, have enough to eat, have sufficient parental support, regardless of how good the school is, he will do badly,\" he says.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Waffling in the Granite State | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>W</b>ITH the New Hampshire primary only 15 days away, voters in the Granite State remain a remarkably undecided bunch. None of the five major Democratic candidates--not Bob Kerrey, Paul Tsongas, Tom Harkin, Jerry Brown or Bill Clinton--has successfully won the hearts of a wide swath of New Hampshire voters.</span></p> <p><span>The polls that show Gov. Bill Clinton and former Sen. Paul Tsongas leading the pack with 20-30 percent of the vote are deceptive: the percentages cited in the polls reflect <i>preferences</i>--they do not specify the candidates' established support. There is a little-under-stood but crucial distinction between people who <i>plan</i> to vote for a candidate and people who are leaning toward a candidate. The numbers reported in most polls account for the percentage of voters who, when pressed, express a preference; they are not--and should not be read as--evidence of firm support for any candidate.</span></p> <p><span>In a recent Boston Globe poll establishing Clinton and Tsongas in the lead, the most notable statistic was the percentage of undecideds, the proportion of registered voters who have not yet made up their minds. That figure--a striking 79 percent--illustrates that almost eight of ten New Hampshire voters are still wavering. Although most voters are leaning toward a particular candidate, only 20 percent know for whom they will be voting in two weeks. Of course, some candidates do have broader support than others. But that support--particularly for the front-runners--is decidedly shallow.</span></p> <p><span>It's difficult to determine exactly why New Hampshire voters are having such a hard time making up their minds. It would seem that President Bush's failure to revitalize New Hampshire's sagging economy--among the worst in the nation--would provide an environment conducive to competition among the Democratic candidates.</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps a later-than-usual start to the campaign season gave citizens of New Hampshire fewer opportunities to hear the candidates. Maybe everyone is so busy being mad at George Bush that few New Hampshire voters have given serious effort to distinguishing among the president's potential Democratic opponents. Whatever the reason, most voters are still undecided--and decidedly so.</span></p> <p><span><b>N</b>ASHUA, N.H.: One of the Granite State's cities hardest-hit by the recession. When I went to Nashua for a day to canvass for Tom Harkin last week, I fully expected that the economy would be the most important issue on the voters' minds--and it was. But I was surprised by the voters' near-universal indecision about which candidate to support.</span></p> <p><span>Of the forty to fifty people I spoke to, only four had made up their minds: I found one Tsongas supporter, two Clinton backers, and one who planned on voting for Harkin. Nearly all of the Nashua residents I met claimed that they planned to vote in the February 18th primary, but 90 percent had not decided on a candidate. Many didn't even know who was running. Here are profiles of some of the voters I talked to:</span></p> <p><span>. Sharon, a young single mother, had just returned from the grocery store with her six-year-old son when I arrived at her apartment. She had not chosen a candidate yet, but was very interested in what Harkin would do for the economy and the health care system. In her neat lower-middle class apartment, Sharon told me that although she resented Bush's handling of the economy, she \"hadn't gotten around to looking into all the candidates.\"</span></p> <p><span>. Jill, an articulate and well-informed woman in her thirties, was supporting Tsongas for the nomination. Harkin was her second choice.</span></p> <p><span>. Jim, an annoyingly talkative older man, identified health care as his number one concern. \"Fifteen minutes in a doctor's office shouldn't cost 95 dollars,\" he told me. \"We need to get rid of the career politicians in Washington and put somebody in there who can really make a change.\" Who was Jim's candidate of choice? Ironically, it was the candidate with the least commitment to reforming the health care system: Republican Pat Buchanan. Buchanan's virtue as a candidate, according to Jim, was that he wasn't a \"career politician\" who played to the special interests.</span></p> <p><span>. Esther, whose family recently emigrated from Israel, was <i>leaning toward</i> Clinton. She and her husband were impressed by Clinton's centrist message and were concerned that the Democratic nominee should be electable in November. Esther was happy, however, to hear of Harkin's strong pro-Israel stance.</span></p> <p><span>. Cecile, a sharp middle-aged woman with an attack dog at her side, stayed behind her screen door as she expressed her disappointment with the Democratic field. While Clinton was too much a shifty politician, Kerrey was too boring, Tsongas too technocratic, and Harkin too short on details. She wanted the candidates to elucidate their messages with more specifics.</span></p> <p><span>. Barbara, who also stayed in her doorway as she talked to me, was primarily concerned about the environment and the economy. She said that she seldom votes in primaries, and did not like any of the candidates in the race; she was waiting for a Green Party candidate. But for her good intentions, Barbara was badly uninformed about the presidential candidates. When I started discussing Harkin's environmental record, she asked: \"Is Harkin a Democrat or Republican?\"</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>T THE end of my day going door-to-door in one of Nashua's very white, very middle-class neighborhoods, I was disillusioned. It's not that the people were apathetic; many expressed anger toward President Bush's bare domestic agenda and uncaring attitude about the economy. But very few people had committed themselves to a candidate. And those leaning toward certain candidates did not have strong reasons for supporting them.</span></p> <p><span>Pre-primary polls are notoriously poor predictors of how the vote will turn out. This year is no exception. For all the media attention and candidate effort and money poured into New Hampshire's primary campaign, the voters aren't doing their part yet. They recognize the issues, but aren't choosing candidates. In these next two weeks--with a barrage of television commercials, debates, and candidate tours of the state--New Hampshire voters will have their final look at the five Democrats vying for their party's nomination. Whether today's preferences will turn into tomorrow's votes is impossible to say.</span></p> <p><span>The only predictable outcome is that George Bush won't do so well. The sole voter I talked to who supported George Bush was a woman who would only speak to me through her living room window. I asked her which issues led her to choose Bush as her candidate. Her answer? \"None.\"</span></p> <p><span><i>Steven V. Mazie '93 is the associate editorial chair of The Crimson. He was formerly the President of Harvard for Harkin.</i></span></p>"}

The John DeLorean-Stealth Bomber-Dynasty-Gordon Gekko-Material Girl-Black Monday-Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous-SDI-Ivan Boesky-Trump Tower-Trump Palace-Trump Castle decade. The decade of Nancy Reagan's $200,000 china, the Pentagon's $640 toilet seat, the country's $200 billion budget deficits. A shamelessly materialistic decade. An irresponsible decade. A morally bankrupt decade. Bad, Bad, Bad.</span></p> <p><span>These are oversimplifications, but facts are facts: America's national savings rate declined by 58 percent during the 80s. And anyway, Hollywood loves oversimplifications. So it's no surprise that an avalanche of cinematically correct movies rumbled out of La-La Land in 1991, dedicated to the proposition that Homo Eightitatus was an obnoxious, Mammon-worshipping egotist. In <i>Regarding Henry,</i> it took a bullet in the head to turn the 80s lawyer into a compassionate human being. In <i>The Doctor,</i> it took a bout with cancer to cure the 80s doctor of his own chronic self-absorption. In <i>Hook,</i> it took a trip to Never-Never Land to cure the 80s corporate raider of his careerist monomania. In <i>Life Stinks,</i> the 80s millionaire didn't know what he had until he literally lost everything.</span></p> <p><span>All of these movies accepted the recent verdict of <i>Time</i> that \"...the 1980s [have] come into focus as a misguided era of borrowed luxury.\" All of these films self-righteously painted the conspicuous consumer of the 80s as a greedy, uncaring bastard. And all of them were boring, hokey pieces of crap that lost millions of dollars for their studios. (Except for <i>Hook,</i> which starred actors with big enough names to turn it into a financially successful, boring, hokey piece of crap.)</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>HICH BRINGS ME to <i>Father of The Bride,</i> a 1991 movie which was neither boring nor overwhelmingly hokey nor crap. But--and this But has gotten me into more heated arguments in the last few months than <i>JFK,</i> the '92 election and the Super Bowl combined--I also think it's a pretty disturbing movie. Billed as \"a comedy about letting go,\" <i>Father of the Bride</i> is the story of an immature but lovable daddy who learns that if he really cares about his daughter's happiness, he must let go--not only paternally (by agreeing to stop trying to control her) but also financially (by agreeing to stop trying to control the costs of her wedding). The explicit message of <i>Father of The Bride--</i>the 1950 Spencer Tracy/Elizabeth Taylor original as well as the 1991 version--is that people are more important than money, and there's nothing wrong with that. But the implicit message of the remake is that the soft budget constraints of the 80s were nothing to be ashamed of; that conspicuous consumption is not only understandable, but admirable; that people who dare to voice concerns aboutextravagant spending are irrational, insensitivegoofballs who need to be taught a lesson. And inan insidious way, it's a pretty convincingmessage.</span></p> <p><span>The main plot of <i>Father of the Bride</i>deals with a sneaker manufacturer named GeorgeBanks (Steve Martin) and his deep love for hismarvelous 22 year old daughter Annie (KimberlyWilliams). The general pattern of thisSilly-Daddy-Doesn't-Want-to-Lose-His-Beautiful-Baby story goes like this: First, something happensthat makes George squirm (Annie cheerfullyannounces that she's engaged; Annie's angelicfiancee puts his hand on her leg; Annie's fianceecalls George \"Dad\"; etc.) Then George unbuttonshis top button, makes funny grimaces and shoutsirrational nonsense. Then George's wife Nina(Diane Keaton), the film's voice of reason, tellshim to stop acting like a lunatic. Then Georgeapologizes like a good dad (\"I come from a longline of overreacters\") and promises to try not togo ballistic anymore. Hugs and smiles all around.</span></p> <p><span>This pattern is repeated whenever George isreminded that he is no longer his daughter's hero.It's cute. It's sweet. It's funny. This pattern, Ihope, is what producer Howard Rosenman was talkingabout in the movie's press release when he saidthat \"The story is a reaffirmation of commitmentto basic family values.\" But this pattern is alsorepeated whenever George is reminded howoutlandishly expensive her wedding will be. TheSilly-Daddy-Doesn't-Want-to-Spring-for-a-Gorgeous-Wedding plot goes like this: First, George hearsbad financial news--the wedding cake will costmore than his first car ($1200); the weddingreception will cost more than his first house($250 a head for 572 guests, $143,000); the churchwill cost extra. Then George histrionically freaksout (the unbuttoned button, the trademark Martingrimaces, the trademark Martin blather). Then Ninacalmly convinces George that he's beingridiculous. Then George apologizes for acting likea total ninny. Hugs and smiles all around.</span></p> <p><span>Moral of the story: you're a total ninny if youworry about outrageous expenditures.</span></p> <p><span><b>D</b>O YOU THINK I'm overreacting? (I do,after all, come from a long line of overreacters.)Meet Franck (Martin Short), the Banks' vaguelyextraterrestrial \"wedding coordinator.\"Extravagance personified. Frank is George's comicfoil. His role is to prance around the peripheriesof the Banks family like a Martian ballet danceron speed, constantly inventing innovative albeitincomprehensible ways to make Annie's \"lohhhvlahwahhhdink\" cost more while George winces andbellyaches about bankruptcy. (Annie is far toonice to ask for anything fancy herself. But youjust know she's beggin' for it.)</span></p> <p><span>Franck always gets his way. Franck wants swansat the wedding, so the Bankses splurge on swans.Franck doesn't want \"chip\" chicken at the wedding,so the Bankses splurge on seafood. Franck wants torepaint the Banks' house, remove all theirfurniture, install a tulip border...you get theidea. If Annie is going to have a lohhhvlahwahhhdink, George is going to have to cough up the$1200 for Franck's kek, even though, as George soinsensitively points out, a kek is just flour andwater. \"Wilcome to za Nahntees, Moostah Bahnks!\"Franck cackles with tyrannical glee. So Nina tellsGeorge to stop being such a spoilsport. So Georgerelents. So Annie smiles with relief. Good boy,George.</span></p> <p><span>Why does George relent? Because he cares abouthis daughter's happiness. The night after one ofhis typical whining sessions (in which hesuggested holding the wedding at The Steak Pit),he sees Annie asleep on the couch where she hadbeen reading a Modern Bride article on \"How toGive a Beautiful Wedding on a Budget.\" Overcomewith emotion, George begins to read aloud: \"Bakeyour own wedding cake...Find a good tailor andcopy a designer dress...Have a friend take thepictures.\" Horrified, he vows that from thatmoment on, he will \"go with the flow.\" No more ofthis insensitive caterwauling about money. Ofcourse, George has a bit of trouble keeping hispromise. A few scenes later, Nina refuses to bailhim out of jail until he agrees to \"pull ittogether,\" to stop hyperventilating, rolling hiseyes, unbuttoning his top button and making facesabout his daughter's astronomical matrimonialprice tag. Every eye roll, he admits, detractsfrom Annie's happiness.</span></p> <p><span>When George does try to save money, itinevitably backfires on him. Instead of laying outfor an expensive Armani tuxedo at a fancy clothingstore, he buys a discount tux from a fast-talkingsheister. No difference, right? Wrong. Bigdifference. George's tux isn't even black. Ofcourse, it looked black to George, and it surelooked black to me. But everybody else can tellthat stingy George is the only character in a navyblue tux. And they go out of their way to mentionit (four, count 'em, four blue tux jokes), much toGeorge's chagrin. He shoulda known better. Georgealso skimped on parking attendants--he hired onlytwo, instead of the four Franck recommended. Sowhile his guests are enjoying the party Georgepaid for, George is stuck outside parking Beamers.He never does get a chance to dance with thebride. Serves you right, George.</span></p> <p><span><b>M</b>Y FAVORITE MOMENT in <i>Father of theBride</i> takes place in the Banks' driveway onthe night before the wedding. Annie and George,unable to sleep, are discussing how difficulttheir imminent separation will be. And then itbegins to snow. The first snowfall in San Marino,California, in 36 years. George starts to speak,then stops.</span></p> <p><span>\"This is going to cost you more money, huh?\"Annie asks sheepishly.</span></p> <p><span>\"No,\" George replies. \"I was just thinking thatI'm going to remember this moment for the rest ofmy life.\"</span></p> <p><span>Hugs and smiles all around. And they're goodhugs and smiles, because they have absolutelynothing to do with money. The hell with Franck.The hell with the swans. The hell with the tulipborders. The hell with a fancy wedding. All thatmatters is that Annie is happy, right?</span></p> <p><span>Wrong. The next morning, Franck's constructioncrew melts the snow off the tulips with a blowdryer. The swans are given lukewarm baths and aredeclared ready to go. Sure, a beautiful weddingrequires love, but it requires swans, too. Thismakes sense in a Franckophilic world where theultimate badge of dishonor is a blue tuxedo, where\"a commitment to traditional family values\" costsnearly $150,000, where the ultimate moral maladyis an inability to \"let go.\" Poor people can'trelate to these values? Well, let them eat kek.</span></p> <p><span>A LITTLE ADDENDUM: Last week, George Bushannounced his new budget proposals, complete withan unprecedented $400 billion deficit. It markedan unabashed return to the free-spending 80s, abold negation of the economic gloom-and-doomers, arevisionist affirmation of the culture of partyingnow and paying later. Good boy, George.

{"title": "Buying (Un) American | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>A</b>MERICAN BUSINESS, reacting to President Bush's recent failure to open Japanese markets to American goods, has reignited its \"Buy American\" campaign. As the argument goes, Americans should buy American products to save American jobs. At least in theory.</span></p> <p><span>In reality, the \"Buy American\" campaign accomplishes little--and probably causes more problems than it solves. In its attempt to use feelings of patriotism (with lots of superimposed red, white and blue) to encourage Americans to purchase domestically made products, the Buy American campaign sidetracks Americans from the fundamental economic problems that are the root cause of our trade deficit.</span></p> <p><span>The oppressiveness of the Buy American campaign is best seen by recent events in Los Angeles. Last December, the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission voted to buy $122 million in rail cars from Sumitomo, a large Japanese conglomerate. Following the President's trip, the Commission bowed to enormous public pressure to Buy American and reneged on the contract.</span></p> <p><span>They decided instead that contractors must keep 70 percent of labor within the United States and 60 percent within Los Angeles itself. The Los Angeles Commission determined that protecting the rail car industry--and saving only 89 jobs in Los Angeles County, according to <i>The Economist</i>--was a higher goal than wisely spending taxpayer money.</span></p> <p><span>The embarrassing reversal of the Los Angeles Commission illustrates a new form of McCarthyism that has emerged across the country. Many U.S. companies have begun to offer rewards to employees who buy American-made products. Monsanto, an American chemical company, currently offers $1,000 to every employee who buys a car made in America. The sad part is that the extra $1,000 will probably be spent on servicing an American car that is vastly inferior to its foreign competition.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE BUY AMERICAN campaign also goes beyond bad economics--it is a not-so-subtle attempt to stir anti-Japanese sentiment. An underlying Japan-bashing theme surfaces in many Buy American advertisements.</span></p> <p><span>Deutsch Incorporated, an advertising agency, recently ran television ads for New York City Pontiac dealers featuring the words of Yoshio Sakurauchi, a Japanese politican who made disparaging remarks about the quality and motivation of American workers. Sakurauchi's comments were set against the menacing background of a rising sun--hardly a subtle allusion.</span></p> <p><span>Print ads for a Chrysler-Plymouth dealer in Anchorage feature photographs from America's battle against Japan in World War II. The message is clear: the Japan that Americans fought against in World War II is still the enemy. In retaliation for their military defeat, Japan is waging economic warfare against the United States.</span></p> <p><span>\"Buy American\" thus means \"Don't Buy Japanese,\" an appeal that comes dangerously close to racism. Japan is not alone in refusing to buy American cars. Few countries World-Wide import automobiles in significant quantities from the U.S. So why are advertisements so heavily concentrated on Japan? Why is the target of Buy American merely Japan, when most of Europe also shuns American products?</span></p> <p><span>Because Europeans look like Americans a racist appeal toward England or France would be much less effective than bashing the Japanese--an easily identified race. And attacks on Japan are especially hypocritical in Los Angeles, Since nearly 85,000 Californians work for Japanese companies and 968,000 Californians are involved in foreign trade.</span></p> <p><span>Even if the average consumer truly wanted to Buy American, he or she would have a tough time distinguishing between what's American and what's foreign. Most American cars, for example, are built with parts supplied by Japanese and other foreign companies.</span></p> <p><span>American cars themselves may be assembled outside the United States. Many American companies operate huge factories in Mexico, a practice that will increase when a North American free trade agreement is finally negotiated.</span></p> <p><span>To add to the confusion, many products with Japanese names are actually made in America. According to The New York Times, nearly 40 percent of Honda, Toyota and Nissan cars are assembled inside the United States, in American factories, by American workers. Are the 4,850 American jobs at the $1.2 billion Nissan plant in Sparta, Tennessee, worth less than jobs of General Motors workers in Detroit?</span></p> <p><span>In Greece, N.Y., the town council voted to buy a more expensive John Deere excavator instead of a cheaper Japanese Komatsu, until it was discovered that the John Deere was assembled in Japan while the Komatsu was put together in Illinois.</span></p> <p><span><b>S</b>O WHO GETS the benefits of Buy American? Channeling economic frustrations against Japan deceives Americans into thinking that the real problems with their economy are caused by Japan. The incompetence of U.S. management has a lot to do with the low quality of American products.</span></p> <p><span>And the outrageous multi-million-dollar salaries of corporate executives illustrate that their concern lies with short-term corporate takeovers and golden parachutes--not with restructuring their faltering industries.</span></p> <p><span>Although Sakurauchi's comment that 30 percent of the American workforce cannot read it surely outrageous, it does contain an element of truth. As <i>Time</i> magazine pointed out recently, nearly 15 percent of American workers are functionally illiterate. And many high school graduates go into the job market without adequate training in math, science and communications--skills critical to today's economy.</span></p> <p><span>If American workers are not properly educated, there will nothing left to Buy American except Desert Storm trading cards and McDonald's hamburgers.</span></p> <p><span>Americans also conveniently forget that, in addition to the cars and electronics that Japan exports, Japan is also a significant investor in U.S. Treasury bonds that finance debt on our spiraling budget deficit. By holding so many U.S. assets, Japan allows Americans--at least in the short-run--to get away with not saving or investing nearly as much as we should. Our economy would grind to a halt if the Japanese subscribed to \"Buy Japanese.\"</span></p> <p><span>Japan isn't the reason for our recessing economy and trade deficit. We are. Until the American people and their politicians acknowledge this fact--and abandon lame efforts to encourage Buying American--our economy will continue to struggle.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Losing His Religion | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><i>Editor's Note: This is the first of a two-part series by Wilson on the Republican party.</i></span></p> <p><span><b>E</b>LEVEN MONTHS AGO, George Bush was on top of the political world. Flushed with a dazzling success in the Gulf, the Commander in Chief reaped popularity ratings of 89 percent (according to Gallup), the highest since such polls have been taken.</span></p> <p><span>Within months, Senators John D. Rockefeller IV and Albert Gore Jr. '69 and Representative Richard A. Gephardt--the heavy hitters of the Democratic party--spared us the vicissitudes of Cuomo-esque posturing and bowed out under the assumption that Bush could not be beaten. The country seemed destined for five more years of Dana Carvey's gesticulating impressions.</span></p> <p><span>My, how times change. An already weak economy plunged into a recessionary \"freefall\" (Bush's own term). United Nations investigators found that Saddam Hussein, entrenched as ever, still possessed nuclear technology. And voters increasingly demanded attention to domestic affairs and questioned Bush's leadership abilities.</span></p> <p><span>A host of second-tier Democrats joined Paul E. Tsongas, the seemingly quixotic candidate who would prove to be astute in predicting the Bush decline. Bush's disapproval ratings, once in the single digits, swiftly spiraled upward.</span></p> <p><span>And just when things seemed bad enough, Patrick J. Buchanan, darling of the right wing, entered the fray. Suddenly, Bush faced the growing likelihood of an early retirement.</span></p> <p><span>The threat to Bush from a fellow Republican should not be written off. Four times since World War II, an incumbent president has faced a strong challenger from within his own party. The incumbent failed to return to the Oval Office in each of these cases.</span></p> <p><span>In 1952, the irascible Harry S Truman was hammered by Estes Kefauver in New Hampshire and faced an even stronger challenge from Adlai E. Stevenson, forcing Truman to call it quits. LBJ met the same fate in 1968 when \"Clean\" Gene McCarthy captured 42 percent of the vote in New Hampshire, giving Robert F. Kennedy '48 a reason to drop his hat into the ring.</span></p> <p><span>Two incumbents survived longer, only to lose in the general election. Gerald R. Ford, bruised and battered from a tough campaign against Ronald Reagan, could not hold on to the presidency in 1976. The winner of that race, Jimmy Carter, met the same fate four years later, when Sen. Edward M. Kennedy '54-'56 made another foray into presidential politics.</span></p> <p><span>In the last four decades, no candidate who has lost the New Hampshire primary has gone on to be elected president. Not one. And if any state can be expected to be unhappy with Bush, it is New Hampshire.</span></p> <p><span>New Hampshire's economy is one of the most depressed in the nation. Voter disenchantment generated by such economic hard times is a powerful tool that can be wielded by Bush opponents. In addition, New Hampshire voters feel the president has betrayed them.</span></p> <p><span>As Bush, former New Hampshire Governor John H. Sununu and a number of political pundits have argued, Bush's 1988 primary win in the Granite State played a critical role in securing him the Republican nomination.</span></p> <p><span>He won over New Hampshire voters, of course, with his now (in)famous \"no new taxes\" pledge. Bush's popular vow proved too much for Sen. Robert Dole, who waffled on the same issue, and soon threw in the towel and headed back to Kansas. Nevertheless, Bush later abandoned his most sacred political pledge, a promise whose appeal had rescued him from the snowdrifts of New Hampshire.</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>HILE BUSH, then, is clearly more vulnerable now than could have been imagined one year ago, I am not about to argue that his weaknesses are severe enough to open the door for a Democratic administration. Bush has yet to play all the cards in his hand.</span></p> <p><span>The Republican campaign team, which he is only beginning to deploy, boasts success in five of the last six presidential elections. In the coming months, he can turn to attack America's number one whipping boy, the U.S. Congress (and, by association, its Democratic majorities), for hardly considering his proposals on education, housing, energy and the capital gains tax cut.</span></p> <p><span>Also in Bush's favor is the widely predicted economic recovery--expected to arrive some time during the primary season--that will placate the electorate's greatest concerns. The proposals forwarded in the State of the Union address illustrate Bush's new focus on domestic policy concerns.</span></p> <p><span>In any case, the Republican electoral lock gives Bush a leg up on the competition. In each of the last six presidential elections, 23 states, accounting for 203 electoral votes, have sided with the GOP. Bush's position and party affiliation spell tough times for any Democratic challengers.</span></p> <p><span>Bush's chances are boosted even more by Democratic weakness. Only when faced with the alternative of \"an unnamed Democrat\" do many voters opt to abandon Bush. Lightweights such as Gov. Bill Clinton, Sen. Bob Kerrey and Tsongas have failed to whet the appetite of the electorate.</span></p> <p><span>And when polls show that perennial noncandidate Mario M. Cuomo, the besieged governor of New York who can do little more than deliver a good speech, still garners more votes than any of the declared candidates, prospects look bleak for the Democrats.</span></p> <p><span><b>S</b>TILL, WHILE THE DEMOCRATS will lose in November, a significant hole exists on Bush's ideological right. First, the Republican primary process is guided by its conservative wing. Just as in the Democratic party, individuals on the extremes are more likely to be involved in the primary process, and, therefore conservatives play a substantial role in the selection of the Republican presidential nominee.</span></p> <p><span>Conservatives have <i>never</i> felt comfortable with George Bush. The man who, in 1980, was in favor of abortion rights and a critic of Reagan's economic policy, which he termed \"voodoo economics,\" has never truly held the support of the Right. The last four years have served to vindicate those fears.</span></p> <p><span>Bush has retreated on conservative positions on issues. For example, funding for the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) is at its highest level ever. Conservatives have long opposed the NEA's grants process, which provides financing for many projects the Right finds objectionable. In addition, Bush has also departed from traditional conservative support for Israel.</span></p> <p><span>He did not rush to support the right of self-determination for the people of the Baltics or the remainder of the former Soviet Union, for Croatia and Slovenia, or for the Kurds. He has continued to coddle China, despite the fact that over one billion people are without virtually any political or economic liberty and despite that government's continuing practice of questionable foreign arms sales.</span></p> <p><span>All of these policies, along with a number of others, have alienated an overwhelming number of conservatives within the Republican party. But even this alienation may not have been politically fatal to Bush's constituency. What is even more tragic for Bush's candidacy is his alienation of fiscal conservatives as well.</span></p> <p><span>These anti-tax, anti-big spending voters--both Democratic and Republican--formed the core of the Reagan-Bush coalition. Bush's broken pledge on taxes damages this coalition more than any other deviation from the conservative agenda. A second strike against Bush is the 10 percent average annual increase in budget expenditures that have occurred in each year of his administration. These increases represent the fastest rate of spending growth since the FDR years.</span></p> <p><span>The ensuing mega-deficit has done nothing to help the economy or to soothe conservatives' anxiety. Finally, Bush is considered by many to be the \"re-regulation king.\" Some consider his administration's increased regulation to be responsible for decreasing corporate competitiveness.</span></p> <p><span>Bush's greatest vulnerabilities, then, are with the same Republican voters who elected him in 1988 (but who also defeated him in 1980).</span></p> <p><span><b>G</b>EORGE BUSH, seemingly fraught with a number of electoral and policy challenges, is weak even within his own party. And with good reason. George Bush, in many ways, has courted his own disaster. He has abandoned his major campaign plank, the continuation of Reaganism and, more specifically, \"no new taxes.\"</span></p> <p><span>He squandered the political capital he gained from the Gulf War by not spending time on the domestic front. In short, he has lost every opportunity for gain that has been presented to him. Now, he has gained an enormous opportunity for loss.</span></p> <p><span><i>Harry James Wilson '93, a Crimson editor, was president of the Harvard Republican Club last year.</i></span></p>"}

As Magic told The Boston Globe last week: \"When you're not with a team, you miss stuff. And you miss the competition. The crowd. Now I have a chance to have that one more time. All of it is going to be great. I'll bottle it. I'll put a cap on it. And I'll never let go.\"</span></p> <p><span>That's strange, Magic. I don't think too many athletes would have a problem \"putting a cap on\" five NBA championships and three league Most Valuable Player Awards--and just walking away. You had your glory days. Be happy for the career you did have.</span></p> <p><span>Furthermore, Magic, you didn't play in a single regular season game. Why should you have played in the All-Star game, which is reserved for the players who have performed the best in the first half of the season?</span></p> <p><span>As for the Olympics, no one more than I would love to see Magic and Larry Bird team up in competition--I've always dreamed of such a day. But not like this. Why don't we just invite Wilt and Kareem to join Team USA as well?</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE most compelling argument against Magic's return, however, concerns his role as a worldwide figure in combating the spread of AIDS. With an appointment to President Bush's AIDS Commission, Magic officially became a messenger to society--and especially to children.</span></p> <p><span>But by returning to the court and living in the spotlight, Magic is truly saying: \"Well, kids, in November I told you to practice safe sex or you will end up like me. But to tell you the truth, I'm fine. You don't need to be as careful anymore.\"</span></p> <p><span>While I don't doubt Magic's sincerity in wanting to assist in slowing down the AIDS epidemic, I do believe he has lost his focus.</span></p> <p><span>Even if, after every game, he was to make a public service announcement promoting safe sex, most teenagers would only remember that he is still able to play basketball.</span></p> <p><span>In fact, when Magic accepted his MVP award on television after yesterday's game, he passed up such an opportunity to promote safe sex. Instead, he delivered a different message. He said that by competing in the All-Star game, he demonstrated that the public does not need to fear people with AIDS or treat them differently.</span></p> <p><span>There is no doubt that the unwarranted fear of AIDS victims still exists in society--and must be addressed. But Magic could get that point across to the world in many other ways without bouncing a basketball.</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately, if Magic continues this basketball fantasy, teenagers are probably going to forget that he ever contracted the disease. The possible springboard to battle the spread of AIDS will be lost.</span></p> <p><span>Magic, I understand why you want those last bits of glory. But in this case, you are only thinking of yourself. The overall costs of your return to society simply don't justify your personal benefits.</span></p> <p><span>Don't get me wrong--if I were selfish, I would love nothing more than to watch you dazzle the basketball world for another five years. I oohed and aahed yesterday with everybody else while watching your patented no-look-behind-the-back passes and exhilarating 25-point performance.</span></p> <p><span>But I'm thinking of the bigger picture. Of the maximum impact you could have in the world's fight against AIDS. And so should you.</span></p> <p><span>For someone who has been such a fine decision-maker throughout your career--both on the fast break and in the public eye--you should reconsider your decision.</span></p> <p><span>It's time for you hang up your shoes for good. See you in the Hall of Fame.</span></p>"}

Tom Harkin (D.-Iowa).</span></p> <p><span>But here in New Hampshire, one of the most conservative states in the union, Harkin has had a more difficult time. The man who calls himself \"the only real Democrat in the race\" for the presidency is shown by the polls to have a dismal rate of support among party voters--about 10 percent.</span></p> <p><span>Still, Harkin supporters in New Hampshire appear to be solidly behind the Iowan, citing his unabashed liberalism.</span></p> <p><span>\"The others are closet Republicans,\" said dyed-in-the-wool Harkin supporter Tom M. Record, a volunteer in the Harkin New Hampshire campaign. \"They're frauds. They're phonies. They're failures.\"</span></p> <p><span>Record, 51, commutes from Worcester, Mass. to Harkin's Salem field office. Like many of the candidate's supporters, the father of three sees the election as reminiscent of 1932's.</span></p> <p><span>\"He's a Franklin Delano Roosevelt,\" Record said, \"a demand-side Democrat, not a fascist Republican.\"</span></p> <p><span>And as supporters compare Tom Harkin to FDR, they also equate his economic proposals with those of the New Deal.</span></p> <p><span>Field Office Coordinator David Brown encouraged that notion as he met with students from Boston-area colleges who had volunteered to canvass Salem neighborhoods.</span></p> <p><span>\"I want you to think CCC, FDR, WPA,\" Brown said, referring to the Civilian Conservation Corps and the Works Progress Administration, two programs designed by Roosevelt to battle the depression.</span></p> <p><span>\"Older people have a real attachment to that,\" he added.</span></p> <p><span>Surrounded by Harkin campaign signs--91 by one count--the canvassers said they were taking those ideas to heart.</span></p> <p><span>\"I like it when he says the best social policy is a job,\" said Angel Taveras '92, who made the one-hour trip with students from Tufts University, Wellesley College and Emerson College.</span></p> <p><span>The invocation of Depression-era politics may be well-advised. After all, Roosevelt carried New Hampshire for four general elections in a period of remarkable success for the Democratic party.</span></p> <p><span>Indeed, with the exception of Lyndon B. Johnson's 1964 landslide, the Democrats have not captured New Hampshire's electoral votes since Roosevelt.</span></p> <p><span>But regardless of whether the Democrats take New Hampshire in '92, indications here are that Tom Harkin is unlikely to be the party's candidate. The bulk of the state's Democratic voters say they are skeptical of the Iowan's politics.</span></p> <p><span>\"I think he was fine for the '40s and '50s but he's not aware of the economic realities of the world,\" said Art I. Grand, a 40-year-old Nashua resident.</span></p> <p><span>Grand, who supports former Massachusetts Sen. Paul E. Tsongas, spoke in an interview before a Nashua town meeting yesterday. Compared to Tsongas, Grand said, Harkin--and the other Democrats--is \"not nearly as smart.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"He's 20 or 30 years behind the times,\" Grand said.</span></p> <p><span>Others, however, say that Harkin's ideas are not necessarily bad but that his campaign has been ineffective.</span></p> <p><span>\"He's had some ideas, but somehow he falls short,\" said brewery worker David Hudon, 51, a life-long New Hampshire resident. \"He just doesn't have any momentum.\"</span></p> <p><span>And one Harkin supporter, attending a conference in Manchester on Saturday, saw the problem in much the same way.</span></p> <p><span>\"He'd be a great president, [but] he's a terrible campaigner,\" said Bob Egbert, 48, of Manchester. \"He can't campaign worth shit.\"</span></p> <p><span>Even so, Harkin fans demonstrate a depth of support uncommon in other Democratic voters, many of whom seem hesitant in their commitment to candidates.</span></p> <p><span>Egbert, who teaches political science at Plymouth State College, complains that unabashed liberalism is exactly what the Democrats need. <t><p>\"The rest are trying to out-Reagan Reagan andout-Bush Bush,\" Egbert said.</p><p>And Record, the ardent Salem campaigner, calledHarkin the \"most noble, patriotic\" candidate.</p><p>\"It's time that this need for patriotism isfulfilled,\" Record said.</p><p><i>Tomorrow: The effect of religion on NewHampshire voters.</i></p></t></span></p> <p>\"The rest are trying to out-Reagan Reagan andout-Bush Bush,\" Egbert said.</p> <p>And Record, the ardent Salem campaigner, calledHarkin the \"most noble, patriotic\" candidate.</p> <p>\"It's time that this need for patriotism isfulfilled,\" Record said.</p> <p><i>Tomorrow: The effect of religion on NewHampshire voters.</i></p> <p><span>\"The rest are trying to out-Reagan Reagan andout-Bush Bush,\" Egbert said.</span></p> <p><span>And Record, the ardent Salem campaigner, calledHarkin the \"most noble, patriotic\" candidate.</span></p> <p><span>\"It's time that this need for patriotism isfulfilled,\" Record said.</span></p> <p><span><i>Tomorrow: The effect of religion on NewHampshire voters.</i></span></p>"}

He's not a liberal egalitarian who thinks every place should be open to everyone without restrictions, nor does he believe some oppressive power dynamic always exists between different ethnic groups.</span></p> <p><span>In fact, he's a scholarly conservative who generally looks with suspicion on the hurling of \"isms\" as a substitute for debate. Yet on this issue, and many similar ones, he assumes that the burden of proof rests on Israel and the Jews to demonstrate their moral legitimacy.</span></p> <p><span>He's far from alone. In most of the public debates surrounding America's relationship with Israel, the question is framed in a way that focuses on what Israel, or American Jews who support Israel, must do to retain America's respect. The only other place we have seen such an obsession with the importance of ethics in politics is in discussions of Bill Clinton's sex life. No other country and no other ethnic group in America is guilty until proven innocent.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>AKE, FOR INSTANCE, the current problem of the loan guarantees. As matters stand now, someone who denounces the link between loans and settlements and who thinks Bush should not meddle in the Israeli election process by humiliating the incumbent will probably be accused of trying to take ethics out of politics. Before we give a cent to Israel, we have to be assured of its moral probity and commitment to human rights.</span></p> <p><span>It's hard to deny that concern for human rights should play an important role in our foreign policy. But the phrasing of the debate was biased against Israel from the start.</span></p> <p><span>The argument has revolved around whether or not our moral obligation to safeguard the rights of the Palestinians is greater than our diplomatic obligation to refrain from using our money to manipulate Israel's internal politics. George Bush has decided the former is more important. This is a dangerously wrong approach.</span></p> <p><span>The issue should not be human rights versus the Israeli government's autonomy--a dichotomy that turns support for Israel into an endorsement of political amoralism. Rather, it should be how to weigh the rights of Palestinians against the equally pressing human rights of the Jews who occupy the new settlements, many of whom are fleeing religious persecution greater than the abuses that the Palestinians suffer.</span></p> <p><span>Moreover, the same politicians and news analysts who turned Israel's stature into a front-page story are silent about the money that America gave to dictators like Saddam Hussein and Hafez El-Asaad of Syria, not to mention the military regimes in Latin America that are backed by the U.S.</span></p> <p><span>Had Hussein not become a threat to our own economic aims, we would never have heard of his brutality, and the U.S. government would have gone on giving him money. Yet as soon as Israel wants a loan to shelter refugees that no other country will take in, the president begins his moral posturing and the rest of America follows suit.</span></p> <p><span>American Jews' sentiments toward Israel are subjected to the same unusual scrutiny. I call it unusual not because I believe citizens' loyalty and countries' moral character are trivial matters, but because no other group is the object of such concern.</span></p> <p><span>Jewish support for Israel is taken as a sign of dual loyalty, or of disloyalty to America. Does that mean that Arab-Americans who feel a personal stake in the Palestinians' fate would also be considered \"un-American\" if they opposed U.S. policies favorable to Israel? Or that African-Americans who call Africa their heritage are not \"true Americans\"?</span></p> <p><span>Every other group is encouraged to celebrate its ethnicity, almost to the point that insisting on a common American culture is considered racist. But in September, Bush appealed to \"the American people\" to stand by him against the Jewish lobbyists for loan guarantees, whom he portrayed as a hostile foreign power hemming him in.</span></p> <p><span>Apparently Jews who support Israel are no longer part of the American people. The point is that he would never have dared try this with any other group.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>F THIS DEBATE is not re-framed in a less biased manner, the question of loans and settlements cannot be resolved without creating more diplomatic problems than it solves.</span></p> <p><span>If Israel halts settlements due to U.S. pressure, its government will lose face for having bowed to coercion. Yet if Bush decides to loan Israel money with no strings attached, he will do it in a way that makes him look like a martyr to Jewish lobbyists. We can hardly expect the Arab nations to respect Israel's right to exist when we implicitly refuse to recognize it ourselves.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Politics Beats Saving Lives | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b>N FEBRUARY OF 1991 the United States decided to send troops to the Persian Gulf to prevent Iraqi aggression against Kuwait. In February of 1992 the United States decided to deny asylum to thousands of Haitians seeking refuge from harassment and violence.</span></p> <p><span>A disturbing double standard exists in the Bush administration's decision to send troops into Kuwait last year and its present position toward the fleeing Haitians. Iraq's aggression merited definitive condemnation by the U.S. government. The brutal conduct of the Haitian dictatorship against its own people deserves similar censure.</span></p> <p><span>But instead of condemning the Haitian authorities, the administration has coddled them. The Haitians, thousands of them, say they are running for political reasons. President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III say they're lying. It's not political persecution they fear--it's American economic goodies they want.</span></p> <p><span>But this cynicism was nowhere to be found last year, when Kuwaitis in the West claimed that Iraq had committed unpardonable atrocities since invading the country. Obviously the U.S. had some reason to believe that the Kuwaitis faced such horrors. The problem is that Bush and Baker have just as much reason to think that the Haitians face political persecution. But since when has reason played any role in the Bush administration?</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE ADMINISTRATION justifies its callous policy of repatriation by denying the allegations of brutality made by these Haitians. Testifying before the House Foreign Affairs committee last month, Secretary of State James A. Baker III claimed that there is no evidence of a repatriated refugee having been the victim of government reprisal.</span></p> <p><span>Baker's casual dismissal of the refugees' claims is inadequate. The refugee project of the Lawyers' Committee for Human Rights condemned the State Department's investigation as cursory and superficial. Arthur Helton, director of the refugee project, countered Baker by asserting that the government has an obligation to prove that the refugees' allegations are false before sending them back to potential danger.</span></p> <p><span>Now the administration has even more reason to believe the Haitians. The U.S. Coast Guard has intercepted several boats of \"double-backers,\" repatriated Haitians trying to leave their homeland for a second time. Documents released by Helton containing the statements of dozens of these \"double-backers\" contradict Baker's claim that Haitian authorities are not persecuting repatriated refugees.</span></p> <p><span>Furthermore, military leader General Raoul Cedras still retains control in Haiti despite an agreement reached last week in Washington between Aristide and leaders of parliament. The proposed plan envisions Aristide's eventual return to Haiti, but this return is not expected to occur in the foreseeable future. The Cedras government which will stay in power for the interim is the same regime from which thousands of Haitians have fled.</span></p> <p><span>Despite a vow from the State Department to intensify its efforts to verify the refugees' claims, they have not halted the repatriation program. U.S. Coast Guard cutters carry hundreds of Haitians back to their homeland every week.</span></p> <p><span>By vowing to intensify verification efforts, the administration acknowledges the potential that repatriated Haitians are being targeted. They should accordingly halt repatriation until this verification can be completed.</span></p> <p><span><b>V</b>ERIFICATION WASN'T even mentioned before the U.S.-led coalition bombed Iraq back to oblivion. operating according to this precedent, the administration should be willing to accept the Haitian refugees' allegation without need for corroborating evidence.</span></p> <p><span>Last year, the U.S. government accepted the testimony of a single, unidentified teenage Kuwaiti female that Iraqi soldiers were removing babies from their incubators and leaving them in the streets to die. The image became a powerful one in discussions about the war, a sort of mantra for Bush's repeated justifications of the eventual ground assault.</span></p> <p><span>The identity of this source whose testimony has such a dramatic effect on provoking concerted condemnation of Iraqi atrocities has been revealed in recent months. She is the daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador to the U.S.</span></p> <p><span>Clearly, the U.S. government concealed her name because reporters would have challenged the legitimacy of her allegations if they had known that she was a direct relative of a high-ranking Kuwaiti official and a member of the Al-Sabah ruling family of Kuwait.</span></p> <p><span>More troublingly, the administration continues to question the veracity of the testimony of thousands of Haitian refugees. Where were these vigilant watchdogs when a lone kuwaiti teenager was telling tales of atrocities committed by Iraqi soldiers?</span></p> <p><span>The sudden, appearance of these conscientious defenders of truth is not an unexplainable phenomenon. A presidential reelection campaign advertisement announcing the influx of thousands of impoverished Haitians probably strikes Bush as far less appealing than an advertisement flaunting the triumphant victory of overwhelming U.S. military forces over a despotic and tyrannical dictator.</span></p> <p><span>Pat Buchanan would have a field-day railing against this latest group of immigrants despoiling our nation. Jimmy Carter went through hell trying to get Cuban refugees out of Florida and Arkansas in 1979. Ronald Reagan slammed him for it. Bush doesn't want to have to stave off a similar attack from Buchanan.</span></p> <p><span>If the U.S. truly concern itself with the preservation of democracy and opposition to oppression, then decisive action to help the Haitians would achieve these ends more effectively than the restoration of rule to the Al-Sabahs in Kuwait. Unlike Emir Al-Sabah, Aristide was a democratically elected leader, the first ever in Haiti.</span></p> <p><span>The administration's tacit acceptance of Aristide's ouster conveys a discouraging message to those who hope to reinstate the fledgling democracy of Haiti. The plan agreed to in Washington last week is only a token gesture which will have no effect in restoring political and personal liberty to Haiti as long as the country's military establishment opposes Aristide's return.</span></p> <p><span>But the repatriated refugees will, of course, suffer the most dire consequences of this heartless policy. If the administration can trust the testimony of one self-interested Kuwaiti teenager, then shouldn't they believe the words of dozens of \"double-backers\" and the desperate actions of thousands of other Haitian refugees?</span></p> <p><span>By choosing not to do so, Bush is guilty not just of employing a double standard--he is also responsible for the suffering that the repatriated Haitians endure.</span></p>"}

He didn't expect <i>Savage Inequalities</i> to become a bestseller. After all, it's a book about the vast differences between rich and poor schools and about how the country's system of school finance has created this gap.</span></p> <p><span>It's no <i>Love Story or even The Hunt For Red October.</i> Rather it's an indictment of the nation's present educational system which benefits only the children of the upper-middle class and the wealthy.</span></p> <p><span>Kozol calls his own ideas \"radical.\" He wants to adjust school funding so that poor and lower middle-class children can get the same educational opportunities that wealthy kids enjoy.</span></p> <p><span>\"If indeed we are a just society, then we at least have to spend as much for poor children [as we do for wealthy children],\" Kozol says.</span></p> <p><span>Although critics argue that giving more money to schools won't help, Kozol believes that smaller class sizes and \"AP\" classes instead of \"auto body and cosmetology\" would mean better performances from poor children.</span></p> <p><span>Kozol thinks that \"the nation is ready to look into its conscience after a decade in which the governing dialogue featured slogans like \"Go for it\" and \"You can have it all.\"</span></p> <p><span>Politically, Kozol realizes the debate over school funding has, and will, divide Americans along class lines. Among the middle-class, for instance, he believes his arguments have strong political support.</span></p> <p><span>\"This is an issue that affect working-class white people,\" Kozol says.</span></p> <p><span>But Kozol knows that his ideas are not political favorites among the upper middle-class and wealthy.</span></p> <p><span>If poor kids were really given equal educational opportunities, says Kozol, \"a lot of these kids would qualify to go to schools like Harvard.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"There would be more competition for people like us,\" Kozol explains.</span></p> <p><span>Kozol believes that it is no accident that schools in poorer neighborhoods often do not receive equitable funding.</span></p> <p><span>He calls this not a \"conspiracy of intent,\" but a \"conspiracy of effect.\"</span></p> <p><span>Kozol is not concerned that his ideas are not likely to garner across-the-board political support anytime in the near future.</span></p> <p><span>\"I never set out to say: here's a pragmatic battle plan for the next four years,\" Kozol says. \"I see my role as an author to envision a just society.\"</span></p> <p><span>The current system fosters inequality, says Kozol, because school funding relies heavily on local property taxes. So, wealthier neighborhoods gather a larger pool of tax money for their kids' education.</span></p> <p><span>Critics argue that simply pumping more money into schools won't help educational quality. Though he stops short of saying that money would definitely make the difference, Kozol believes putting more money into poor schools would be a \"noble social experiment.\"</span></p> <p><span>Kozol is angered by what he perceives as a nationwide lack of attention to segregated schools.</span></p> <p><span>\"They'll (the Bush Administration) talk about everything except the central moral agony of our society-that we are still two nations,\" Kozol says.</span></p> <p><span>Kozol's thoughts on desegregation are far outside the bounds of current political debate. \"In the North, the only feasible system of desegregation would have to be between the cities and suburbs,\" he says.</span></p> <p><span>But Kozol has no illusions about the political feasibility of such a system. \"Virtually no white liberals are willing to discuss this,\" he says. Even during the Boston busing crisis, Kozol says, Boston suburban liberals \"used their own racism to exonerate racists of South Boston.\"</span></p> <p><span>Kozol, an English literature concentrator while at Harvard who graduated in '58, lived in Eliot House across the hall from his classmate Senator Jay Rockefeller.</span></p> <p><span>\"All the students and faculty at Eliot House pretended they were British,\" he recalls. \"They had the 'Henry James disease.'''</span></p> <p><span>Although his academics allowed him to go to Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar, Kozol says he \"studied much too hard at Harvard.\"</span></p> <p><span>After Oxford, Kozol spent a few years writing in Paris amid older writers like Allen Ginsberg, William Styron and Richard Wright.</span></p> <p><span>In 1963, Kozol came back into the United States to \"do something respectable\" like \"go to law school and then to the Senate.\"</span></p> <p><span>But the civil rights movement inspired him to take the \"longest trip I ever took,\" a 20-minute trip on the subway to Roxbury where Kozol volunteered as a schoolteacher. Eventually he was fired from the Boston schools for reading a Langston Hughes poem to his students.</span></p> <p><span>Kozol believes he is one of the few true liberals who still fights the good fight. Even now, as a successful member of the political/literary establishment whose name is held up high by senators and journalists, Kozol feels betrayed by some of his old liberal friends, whom he calls \"all these nice people in New York who get out Pete Seeger records and reminisce about their youthful ethics.\"</span></p> <p><span>Kozol laments what he sees as a loss of idealism among these \"decent-minded, progressive people. \"While some of these people travelled to Mississippi to register blacks in the summer of 1964, Kozol says, \"today it's their kids, and they don't want them going to school with anyone who might hold them back.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "BAD to the Bone | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>\"B</b>AD IDEAS are those that are palpably unsound...BAD ideas, on the other hand, are widely accepted and so familiar as to go largely unquestioned.\"</span></p> <p><span>This distinction, invented by Paul Fussell in his Book <i>BAD, or the Dumbing of American,</i> is a godsend for the frustrated, thinking person. Fussell applies BAD only to national idiocies, but several palpably bad--and widely accepted--ideas floating around Harvard could use some scrutiny as well.</span></p> <p><span>Once one gets into the mode of identifying BAD--defined as the huge gap between appearance and dismal reality--it comes easily. Some national BAD ideas; the \"Buy American\" (i.e. \"Don't Buy Japanese\") craze, thinking that tax cuts enacted over a year from now will somehow alleviate the present recession, the assumption that we care whom Bill Clinton slept with and how many times and the idea that the public's \"right to know\" means that rape victims should be forced to testify live in front of 250 million people.</span></p> <p><span>But if you think BAD ideas are merely a product of public ignorance and demented profit seeking, you are sadly mistaken. We have a number of inanenotions circulating around Harvard under the pretense of rationality.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>N INSTITUTIONAL idea at Harvard that epitomizes BAD is the belief that extracurricular activities, such as the Parliamentary debate team, should be basically self-supporting, while sports teams should not. Who came up with this idea? Fortunately, other schools (like Princeton, Rhode Island College, and the most of the rest of the planet) do not share this mental paralysis.</span></p> <p><span>Not only does Harvard have more money than other schools (and many states and nations), but extracurriculars are so <i>cheap.</i> How much money does Harvard pour into its football team? How strong is the admissions tip (another BAD idea) for a team that can be counted on to lose? Undeniably, Harvard's extracurriculars--not sports--are its strength.</span></p> <p><span>While it is reasonable to think that some activities should fund themselves (such as publications, which can sell ads), most extracurriculars are not businesses. (Please don't respond that the nominal Undergraduate Council grant constitutes \"support\".)</span></p> <p><span>Mentioning our student government brings us to two more BAD ideas. The first is that the Council is somehow representative of anything. Wake up! We're talking about a group of students who get together and play student council. It barely qualifies as an institution, let alone a representative body.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>NOTHER BAD idea is that the Council, unrepresentative as it is, has some sort of legitimate claim to appropriations for extracurriculars. It doesn't. Not only are Council members incapable of assessing the strength of competing claims, but their logic is idiotic.</span></p> <p><span>A group or team that's been around for a few years will get a small grant, the Council reasons, because with time it should become self-supporting. Why is that? What financial means are supposed to be available now that weren't before? Why should extracurriculars be self-supporting at all? This premise is very BAD indeed.</span></p> <p><span>Yet another institutional source of BADness is the Quantitative Reasoning Requirement. Passing this requirement somehow means that we know about statistics and computers (Only statistics for the lucky class of '95). But how do writing a uselessly simple program and cramming for a test demonstrate anything? If we are expected to be statistically literate, then the QRR should make sure we are statistically literate. The pseudo-requirement we have now is pointless.</span></p> <p><span><b>S</b>OMETIMES BAD is so obvious that it is perhaps better called <i>bad,</i> because it is neither widely accepted nor unnoticed. Take, for instance, the non-uniform grading curves that exist in large courses, making getting the right TF equivalent to winning the GPA lottery.</span></p> <p><span>What is the theory behind the idea that TFs should decide grades independently? If you plan on taking Literature and Arts A 40a or b or Government 10, make damn sure you get an easy section leader. Of course, sometimes you don't have a choice. In the sophomore tutorial for history, for example, the <i>amount of assigned reading</i> varies among sections (Reaching beyond BAD into ATROCIOUS).</span></p> <p><span>The are some political sources of BAD ideas on campus. Take the conservative view that homosexuality is \"deviant\" and \"unnatural\"--an inexplicable belief given that homosexuals have <i>always</i> existed in the same proportion in <i>every</i> past society.</span></p> <p><span>And then there's the notion that homosexuality is morally bad because the purpose of love relationships is procreation--procreation assumed as <i>good</i> in a world of starvation, overcrowding and rapid destruction of the environment to sustain a human population that everyone wishes were a lot smaller.</span></p> <p><span>Some people believe that Western culture should have primacy in a liberal education either because it is truly better than other cultures or because it is more relevant to our way of life. The first claim is amusing; the second, puzzling. The whole point of a liberal education is to learn subjects like philosophy, literature and quantum physics that probably will be completely irrelevant to whatever we do in the future. Harvard, as we all know, is not a trade school.</span></p> <p><span>Probably the last great BAD idea on campus circulates among a number of men in final clubs who are definitely not fans of the Radcliffe Union of Students. Let's face it, guys: The finals clubs are sexist. And elitist. It takes so little imagination to see what goes on the Porcellian or the Fly and so little effort to realize why they don't want to admit women. Guys, why bother with the pretense that there is something beyond institutional misogyny that would suffer if women were admitted? Spare us.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HIS LIST is not all inclusive. There is a lot of idiocy going on around us waiting to be noticed. Like the absurdly few number of left handed chairs in lecture halls. Or the printing of new editions of textbooks that are virtually identical to past editions, different enough only to render to old versions unusable--this resting on the dual falsities that students are so tremendously wealthy that they can afford never to buy used books, and that the environment has an unlimited supply of trees for us to chop down. With minimal effort you're bound to find some more BAD ideas.</span></p> <p><span>They're everywhere you look.</span></p>"}
{"title": "The Foundation for Intercultural Hypocrisy | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>Y</b>OU WOULD NOT ask Paul Tsongas to donate money to Bill Clinton's presidential campaign. You would not expect Iraq's United Nations representative to vote for the resolution condemning his country in the Gulf War. You would not count on a sane squirrel to stop mid-stride to let a dog catch him in a mad dash across the Yard.</span></p> <p><span>These occurences just don't happen and few assume that they should.</span></p> <p><span>Surprise, surprise. Right here on campus, a student-run group bucked such expectations and sponsored and event that directly contradicts the organization's mandate. The Student Advisory Committee (SAC) of the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations funded a speech two weeks ago by Conrad L. Muhammad, national student representatives of the Nation of Islam.</span></p> <p><span>This is no sudden discovery. The Foundation's funding was announced before the talk and reported in The Crimson the following day. What is surprising is the absolute silence that has greatest the Foundation's actions.</span></p> <p><span>What should people be upset about?</span></p> <p><span>The Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, a group whose stated goal is \"to improve relations among racial and ethnic groups within the University,\" granted money and brought to Cambridge one of the most racially divisive speakers this campus have seen all year. This guy makes Leonard Jeffries look like a pussycat.</span></p> <p><span>Muhammad didn't limit himself to divisions along racial lines. He made sure to lash out at women, Jews and sell-out Blacks of the \"White establishment\"--few groups escaped the minister's vitriol.</span></p> <p><span><b>B</b>ILLED AS A PANEL talk on rap with Chuck D, Muhammad's lecture was more of a diatribe by a Louis Farrakhan protege than a statement about current music trends. Muhammad minced no words when discussing America's white people.</span></p> <p><span>Directing his words to Blacks in the audience, Muhammad said of whites, \"They would stab you, stick a knife in your back in a minute. \"Saying \"We must fight the evil of the white man,\" Muhammad told Black students to \"go into the sewers and the subways and actually carry out guerrilla warfare.\"</span></p> <p><span>Blacks too involved with \"white society,\" Muhammad said, were guilty of \"selling out\" and therefore \"worthy of death.\" Blacks, the minister said, should not be at Harvard, studying \"the curriculum of the enemy.\" With such talk, the Foundation certainly succeeded in bringing \"a view which is absent or lacking on campus,\" one of the group's criteria for receiving a student grant. But fostering dialogue is different from sponsoring a call for violence and racial warfare.</span></p> <p><span>Muhammad's comments about women were perhaps the most offensive of the evening. \"Woman's nature is to submit and to find comfort in a man,\" Muhammad stated, and further asserted that \"the Black woman is the field of the Black man. If the Black man would be what God made him to be, Black women wouldn't resist.\"</span></p> <p><span>Muhammad saved his words about Jews until the very end. He held up a Nation of Islam book titled <i>The Secret Relationship Between Blacks And Jews,</i> a tract filled with Jeffries-esque assertions about Jewish domination of the African slave trade. Muhammad then began defending his mentor, Louis Farrakhan, from accusations of anti-Semitism, saying \"The criminal has turned it around on the good citizen.\"</span></p> <p><span>When a Jewish `member of the audience asked the speaker, \"Who's the criminal?\" Muhammad shot back, \"You and your people have a history of crime as long as the highways of America.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Israel is an outlaw nation,\" Muhammad continued. \"Zionism is a racist philosophy. I don't believe if there is a God anywhere in the universe that he will acquit you and Israel and your brothers in America and Europe of the crimes you have committed against humanity.\"</span></p> <p><span>But that's not all. Muhammad had more to say: \"We don't stop with humanity. Because if you think your crimes are limited to humanity, just ask the ozone layer, the rivers, the streams, the oceans, the land.\" I guess Jews have worse body odor and all that extra deodorant has ripped a whole in the atmosphere above Greenland. I'll have to start buying extra strength Rite Guard.</span></p> <p><span><b>D</b>OESN'T IT SOUND like intercultural and race relations were improved in Sanders Theater that night? And what about the Foundation's started goal--\"to reduce the isolation and estrangement felt by minority students without encouraging the separation of races.\" Nothing like reverse psychology. By funding Muhammad, the Foundation supported the very concept that it supposedly is working to erase.</span></p> <p><span>And no one among the organizations which usually work to promote positive intergroup relations on campus is speaking out. There is a Radcliffe Union of Students representative sitting on the Foundation's Students Advisory Council. With no peep of protest, it seems that women on campus and the group that advocates women's concerns were not offended by funding the dissemination of the minister's sexist remarks.</span></p> <p><span><b>S</b>AC'S CO-CHAIRS, Muneer I. Ahmad '93 and Natosha O. Reid '93, offered explanations, but they are unacceptable. Ahmed cites \"the need to place speakers in their context. If Muhammad was speaking on anti-Semitism he would not have been funded.\"</span></p> <p><span>Reid agreed, saying \"We are not judging his political views but how he contributes to a particular project.\"</span></p> <p><span>This is idea of separating the speaker's personal opinions from his or her topic of discussion is ridiculous. Sure Muhammad was part of a program on Black rap music, but could he be expected not to focus on the divisive doctrines of the Nation of Islam during his speech? After all, he's their campus representative. Would SAC grant money for David Duke to speak about African-American or Jewish culture, ignoring his Ku Klux Klan and Neo-Nazi past?</span></p> <p><span>Even if there is significant Black Muslim influence in rap music, granting money to bring a leader in the Nation of Islam--a group led by a man who called Judaism a \"gutter religion\" and termed Hitler a \"great man\"--to Harvard could only do more harm than good, leading to further polarization of campus racial and ethnic groups.</span></p> <p><span>But even if Muhammad's association with Farrakhan were not reason enough to refuse funding the minister's lecture, Muhammad's past statements should have been enough to hint that he wasn't stopping by for the weekend to talk music but to bring anger and prejudice to a boil and preach the passionate polemics of hate.</span></p> <p><span>But to research speakers receiving Foundation grant money would be asking too much, I suppose, from the student group. SAC Members recall little, if any, debate accompanying the rapper/racist Chuck D/Conrad Muhammad project proposal at the group's February 10 grants meeting.</span></p> <p><span>In fact, the meeting lasted for six or seven hours, and many members who now claim they would have argued against funding a talk by a Nation of Islam leader left the committee gathering before the grant came up for discussion. Those who stayed said the Muhammad grant met with much less resistance than other proposals on the table.</span></p> <p><span>But, unfortunately, this scenario presents nothing out of the ordinary according to members of the committee. Little research is ever conducted to investigate the background of speakers included in grant applications submitted to the Foundation.</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps the large number of applications would overwhelm a student group. But read the following description of SAC found in the Foundation's booklet: \"[SAC's] primary responsibility is to review student grant requests and award funding with the approval of the Faculty Advisory Committee.\" It's not too much to expect SAC to perform its \"primary responsibility\" in a thorough and respectable manner.</span></p> <p><span>It is also not unreasonable to expect SAC to conduct in-depth checks on speakers under consideration, seeing that the group may pay the individual for coming to Harvard. Even our parents occasionally want to know what they're getting for their $20000-plus tuition bill.</span></p> <p><span>To its credit, SAC does suggest in its grant guidelines the submission of a \"short biography...to help us better evaluate the project.\" But apparently this portion of the application, if included, rarely embarks upon anything more than the speaker's title and place of residence. In any case, if SAC members did have Muhammad's biography during their meeting, then they have exhibited even greater irresponsibility and insensitivity than if they had simply approved the Nation of Islam grant unaware of Muhammad's past.</span></p> <p><span>Someone didn't do their homework. And it wouldn't even have been so difficult.</span></p> <p><span><b>C</b>ONRAD MUHAMMAD spoke only a month and a half ago in the Philadelphia Civil Center, introducing Louis Farrakhan before a Martin Luther King Day crowd of 16,000. Muhammad was featured in national headlines--ranging from <i>The Washington Post</i> to the Cable News Network--for his role in bringing Farrakhan to speak at the University of Pennsylvania less than four years ago.</span></p> <p><span>Conrad Tillard, as he was known in his pre-ministerial days, was a student at the University of Pennsylvania from 1986 through 1988, when he left without receiving a diploma to become the national youth representative for the Nation of Islam, a post Farrakhan created for him.</span></p> <p><span>While at Penn, Muhammad split the Black community on campus by forming the Organization of Black Consciousness, challenging the already-existing Black Student League.</span></p> <p><span>While in Philadelphia, Muhammad frequently addressed audiences using inflammatory and racist rhetoric, calling white people at one time,\" the blue-eyed devil,\" another time, \"the enemy of humanity\" and still another time, the \"killer\" who creates an \"unseen reality\" that manipulates Blacks to commit violent acts against each other.</span></p> <p><span>In his introduction of Farrakhan's 1988 address at Penn, Muhammad called the Nation of Islam leader \"My God.\" Is this the kind of role model you'd want a healer of racial wounds to bring to Sanders Theatre?</span></p> <p><span>With information like this readily available, there was no excuse for Foundation money to have been anywhere near Conrad Muhammad two weeks ago. This man's job for the past four years has been to travel from campus to campus advocating the separation of races, a doctrine directly in conflict with the Foundation's goals.</span></p> <p><span>The Foundation's Student Advisory Committee owes this campus an explanation of its self-defeating and irresponsible decision. And it has to come up with something better than the separating-the-person-from-the-topic argument which could be used to justify Foundation funding of an Adolf Hitler address on homosexuality.</span></p> <p><span>Expecting such and individual to limit his comments to the contribution of rap music to culture is naive at best. Even if SAC had no clue of Muhammad's past racist comments, funding a Nation of Islam speaker does anything but follow the Foundation's motto to \"enhance the quality of our common life.\"</span></p>"}

Jesse Jackson and several even less prominent candidates against the sitting governor of the commonwealth, Michael S. Dukakis. The Republican ballot was headed by George Bush, who was born in Milton, Mass.</span></p> <p><span>Dukakis received 57.3 percent of the Democratic vote in that election, followed by Jackson with 18.2 percent. Bush won 57.3 percent of the Republican votes, though only 8000 more than Jackson. Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas was second with 25.8 percent.</span></p> <p><span>The 1992 election has produced essentially the same scenario. Former Sen. Paul E. Tsongas, born and raised in Lowell, Mass. is a known quantity to the state's voters. Tsongas stands to win by a huge margin, and Republicans in the state seem unlikely to desert Bush in large numbers.</span></p> <p><span>Tsongas and his main rival Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton have criss-crossed the South in preparation for Super Tuesday, on which 11 states will hold primaries or caucuses. But Tsongas competitors have largely ignored Massachusetts until this weekend, conceding a Tsongas victory here.</span></p> <p><span>Indeed, in a poll published in The Boston Globe on Sunday, Tsongas received 64 percent of the Democratic vote here, and Clinton eight percent. Former California Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. took six percent, Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey--who dropped from the race the day after the poll's completion--four percent and Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin, who left the race yesterday, three percent.</span></p> <p><span>Massachusetts may actually have received more attention in the weeks preceding the February 18 New Hampshire primaries. Campaign advertisements aired on Boston television and radio, and candidates occasionally left the Granite State to pick up endorsements or to give speeches in Massachusetts.</span></p> <p><span>In one sense, Tsongas may have the most to lose today. A strong showing in the state by Clinton or any other candidate would be considered a blow to the Tsongas campaign.</span></p> <p><span>Such an outcome is not out of the question. Clinton has received endorsements from several Democratic legislators and other officials, including former Attorney General Francis X. Bellotti.</span></p> <p><span>Bellotti made his endorsement Saturday, saying the Arkansas governor was \"substance with style,\" parodying Tsongas' \"substance over style\" campaign theme.</span></p> <p><span>Tsongas may recognize his own mortality; he opted to return to Boston last night for a rally and to stay in the state tonight, rather than travel to Illinois or Michigan, two states with important primaries next week.</span></p> <p><span>Brown also made the journey north, speaking at a rally on the Boston Common yesterday.</span></p> <p><span>Despite the competition, political analysts are predicting that Tsongas will not be disappointed with his Massachusetts finish.</span></p> <p><span>\"You've got the person who is the most popular political figure in the state running,\" Martin A.

Almost every major Florida newspaper endorsed Tsongas, but Clinton has an organized volunteer network in the state that could be the critical difference in a close election.</span></p> <p><span>Former California Gov.

William F. Weld '66, Lt. Gov. Paul Cellucci, State Republican Party Chair Leon Lombardi and State Rep. Dave Peters.</span></p> <p><span>The event, which was closed to the public, stood in sharp contrast to the raucous rally for former California Gov. Edmund G.

And that anti-establishment attitude has not changed.</span></p> <p><span>Now, Brown runs a barebones presidential campaign that accepts no contributions greater than $100, camping out in supporters' living rooms rather than the hotel suites frequented by his rivals.</span></p> <p><span>And as the primary season enters a crucial stage, there are signs that Brown's anti-establishment message is catching on--and that his bare-bones campaign may be adding some flesh.</span></p> <p><span>\"Raise your had if you've never given a thousand dollars to a presidential candidate,\" Brown asked a crowd of more than 1000 longtime supporters, new converts, and lookers-on yesterday in the Boston Common.</span></p> <p><span>When a sea of hands went up, Brown said, \"You are the kind of people successful presidential candidates do not spend enough time with.\"</span></p> <p><span>Brown has spent nearly all of his time on the campaign trail railing against the political establishment. Still, the successful campaign that he appears to be building could make Brown a Democratic contender to be reckoned with.</span></p> <p><span>Less than a week after finishing fifth in New Hampshire, Brown used his opposition to nuclear power to secure a virtual tie with former Massachusetts Senator Paul E. Tsongas in Maine. In the pas week, the former California governor has won the hotly contested Colorado primary and the Nevada caucuses.</span></p> <p><span>In spite of these successes within the system, the candidate says he is committed to complete reform of the current political structure.</span></p> <p><span>\"This is a system here I'm trying to change,\" Brown said yesterday. \"If you feel you're being ripped off, lied to, then this is your candidacy right here.\"</span></p> <p><span>Brown's strongest supporters say that it is this particular aspect of the candidate's message that appeals to them most strongly.</span></p> <p><span>\"I've listened to liberals complain about the corruption of American government all my life,\" said John C. Cole, 28. \"And I finally found someone who's going to do some-thing about it--if he gets elected.\"</span></p> <p><span>Cole carried a sign that read \"Down with PACs, Up With People,\" a reference to the political action committees that fund many top political campaigns but have been rebuffed by Brown as well as his Democratic rivals Tsongas and Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton.</span></p> <p><span>With his populist rhetoric, Brown's critics have wondered aloud if the former chair of the California Democratic Party, whose father was also governor, is the right man for his message.</span></p> <p><span>Brown acknowledges his political history, but maintains that his association with the system will help him overhaul it.</span></p> <p><span>\"It's not that I don't know how to [raise money],\" Brown said during the rally yesterday. \"I've raised more money that Clinton or Tsongas ever have, but I know it doesn't work.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"This country has been presided over by leaders who have forgotten who they work for,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>Beyond his fierce opposition to the system, Brown emphasizes his stands for environmental protection and energy efficiency and against nuclear power.</span></p> <p><span>\"We put a space shuttle up there, we've got nuclear bombs--so we can build a car that won't pollute,\" Brown said.</span></p> <p><span>Brown has also been known to adopt policies of his rivals on issues that are not his focus.</span></p> <p><span>The candidate openly endorses the health care plan of Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey, who dropped out of the race for the Democratic nomination last week.</span></p> <p><span>And Brown has joined Tsongas in criticizing a Clinton-proposed tax cut for the middle class.</span></p> <p><span>\"I'm not for a middle class tax break like Clinton wants...that is only a dollar a day,\" Brown said.</span></p> <p><span>As the Democratic race has narrowed to three candidates, Brown and his message, once ignored by the media and derided by commentators as the product of too many meditation sessions with his Indian gurus, is now considered mainstream.</span></p> <p><span>The candidate was featured on the front page of yesterday's New York Times, and the newspaper defended his proposal for a flat, 13 percent tax rate on its editorial page.</span></p> <p><span>And while so-called \"Governor Moonbeam\" was ignored by the other candidates in early debates. Brown now receives respect and sometimes harsh condemnation from his presidential peers.</span></p> <p><span>The attention Brown now receives is commensurate with his political clout after respectful showings in the season's early primaries.</span></p> <p><span>But with Democratic voters concerned about nominating a candidate who can win the presidency, even those who agree with Brown say they are not sure they will vote for him.</span></p> <p><span>\"I think we just need a complete change,\" said Rita Carson, 52, who works in a downtown Boston bank.\"But I worry that he's not electable.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Still, I'd vote for Jack the Ripper over George Bush,\" Carson said.</span></p>"}

While our congressional representatives vote themselves a $23,000 pay raise, many Americans are struggling to make $23,000 a year. Politicians are the problem, not the solution. That's why I urge you not to waste your vote in the Massachusetts presidential primary by voting for a politician. Instead, cast your vote for Ralph Nader, and help bring the government back under the people's control.</span></p> <p><span>Ralph Nader is not a politician. He is the nation's most effective consumer advocate, a Harvard Law School graduate who has been fighting evil corporations and special interest groups in Washington, D.C. for the past 30 years. His platform includes a repeal of the congressional pay raise, term limits for elected public officials, a binding none-of-the-above option in all elections and campaign finance reform. He has hosted Saturday Night Live.</span></p> <p><span>In addition, Nader calls for giving taxpayers and consumers more control of public monopolies such as utilities and cable television. If corporations are to rake enormous profits from such monopolies, don't they owe something to the taxpayers and consumers who truly own public lands and the airwaves?</span></p> <p><span>Bill Clinton is a politician to the bone, as shown by his refusal to resist the draft out of concern for his \"political viability.\" Paul E. Tsongas has been through the revolving door, serving as a corporate lobbyist. And Edmund G. Brown is a suspiciously recent convert to the \"outsider\" fold.</span></p> <p><span>Ralph Nader is none of the above.

{"title": "Choose Tsongas | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>As the most diverse and powerful nation in the world, the United States needs a president who can lead the nation out of its economic woes. A president with integrity who will not lie to the people he represents. A president who will ensure that the American experiment does not fail.</span></p> <p><span>We are convinced that Paul E. Tsongas has the economic battle plan and the moral mettle to lead the United States--which has faltered over the last decade--back to recovery.</span></p> <p><span>Tsongas would start with the basics. The former U.S. senator realizes that a middle-class tax cut will do nothing to increase our competitiveness with foreign powers. It won't create any jobs. And it won't do anything to spur an economic recovery.</span></p> <p><span>Rival Bill Clinton calls Tsongas \"cold blooded\" because he eschews campaign gimmicks.</span></p> <p><span>Indeed, Tsongas knew he was opening himself up for criticism when he offered the truth. But if we are going to boldly address our problems, we need straight answers--not political symbols--as solutions.</span></p> <p><span>And he has done that throughout his career. When he was in U.S. Senate, Tsongas stood up to bipartisan opposition and voted to bail out the Chrysler Corporation--an effort that saved 250,000 jobs.</span></p> <p><span>Tsongas is a determined fighter. An underdog, he came out of nowhere to win seats on the Middlesex County Council, in Congress in 1974 and in the U.S. Senate in 1978.</span></p> <p><span>And less than two months ago, he was still the favorite target of jokes in the public eye. Now he has victories in three primaries and the Washington caucus under his belt. All this with the backdrop of his remarkable battle--and defeat--of cancer a few years ago.</span></p> <p><span>This guy has never lost an election, and he has never waged a dirty campaign. His trustworthiness is second to none in the field of candidates.</span></p> <p><span>But Bill Clinton's track record is far from perfect. The allegations against his character in recent months are many, and it's likely that there are more skeletons lurking in the closet.</span></p> <p><span>Furthermore, Clinton has themes and slogans, but no message. Clinton's redistribution of wealth does nothing for the poor, creates no jobs and does not improve our ability to compete--nor does it reduce the deficit. It's an election year trick. And we are tired of tricks.</span></p> <p><span>We are the world's greatest debtor, 36 million Americans have no medical insurance, and we are losing our competitive edge in the world economy. Worst of all, we have a military-dependent economy.</span></p> <p><span>Tsongas admits there is no painless way to make a transition to his new plan for America. The decision to downsize our arsenal will cost many jobs and job retraining expenditures. The reduction of our debt will take fiscal discipline and commitment. Again, Tsongas economic plan--developed with famous MIT economist Lester Thurow--is clear.</span></p> <p><span>It calls for a capital gains tax cut for stocks with cuts deepening the longer they are held. This wisely encourages long-term investment.</span></p> <p><span>It is important to distinguish this from Bush's plan to cut taxes for real estate development, which is worse than useless. Buildings with no businesses will not help the unemployed and any construction jobs created will be temporary.</span></p> <p><span>Tsongas realizes that America cannot continue to divide a shrinking pie. \"Democrats must get in the business of wealth creation,\" he has insisted. He recognizes the Democratic party's fatal contradiction of claiming to be pro-jobs while lashing out at American business.</span></p> <p><span>To reduce the deficit he would enact a flexible freeze requiring the freezing of funding for less critical programs (bombers or submarines) if the cost of critical ones (education and safety net programs) are raised.</span></p> <p><span>A Tsongas administration would also encourage and invest heavily in research and development--a key to our long-term success that has been largely ignored in recent years.</span></p> <p><span>Tsongas recognizes a desperate need for cooperation among business, labor and government, as opposed to the old confrontational methods. Here again he is willing to take the critical step.</span></p> <p><span>And Tsongas record on gay rights and a woman's right to choose has remained consistently stellar. It has not been modified over the last few years as has Clinton's.</span></p> <p><span>Clinton has shamelessly gone on the attack while offering inadequate explanations for his sordid past. Much of his support stems from the belief that only a Southerner can win the South. But American people aren't just looking for a regional candidate--they're looking for meaningful moral and fiscal change in government.</span></p> <p><span>In order to reinvigorate our economic base while maintaining liberal social values, we need Paul Tsongas in the White House. He has a economic and socially sound plan for our future and he is someone we can trust. Paul Tsongas deserves our votes.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Vote Bill Clinton | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>B</b>ILL CLINTON graduated from Yale Law School in 1973. The next year he ran for Congress.</span></p> <p><span>Ambitious? You bet. Still just a snot-nosed Rhodes Scholar, Clinton lost that election. But only by a few points. He's been moving up ever since, as perhaps the slickest pol the Democrats have offered since JFK.</span></p> <p><span>But his success is explained not just by the crass style and posturing that marks a winning politician. Clinton has considerable substance as well. His ability to address a crowd with all the down-home furor of Tom Harkin's \"Bullshit!\" speechifying and yet all the technocratic details of Mike Dukakis' white papers make him not just a good policy driver but a good policy maker. Clearly, Clinton would be the best president.</span></p> <p><span>And, perhaps most important, he's the only one of the Democrats with a chance in hell of beating Bush.</span></p> <p><span><b>C</b>LINTON'S successes in Arkansas are impressive. Working with a conservative legislature and a state so poor that it provides less than one percent of federal revenues, Clinton has created a laboratory for badly needed change.</span></p> <p><span>Since he first became governor in 1978, Arkansas has flourished and currently leads surrounding states in job growth and almost all states in educational improvements. The Clinton record in Arkansas reads like a K-School professor's dream:</span></p> <p><span>By decreasing class sizes and setting standards for both students and teachers, Clinton has given Arkansas the highest high school graduation rate in the South.</span></p> <p><span>Clinton pushed the legislature to establish annual $1000 college scholarships for all middle and lowincome students who maintain a 2.5 grade point average and stay off drugs.</span></p> <p><span>Clinton has expanded and restructured vocational education in the state to include generous apprenticeship and technical training programs which have kept more non-college bound students in high school. And he has not quarantined vo-tech programs in urban areas but has kept them integrated into larger high schools.</span></p> <p><span>By providing targeted investment tax credits to businesses, Clinton has overseen the second largest period of job growth in Arkansas' history. In 1991, for example, while the national average plummeted, Arkansas ranked seventh in job growth.</span></p> <p><span>To help minority businesses, in 1983 Clinton issued an executive order establishing a \"10 percent goal\" that requires that at least 10 percent of certain state services and products be purchased from minority businesses. And he made it easier for minority businesses to bid for state contracts.</span></p> <p><span>All this in a state with only one interstate, no national sports teams and a hog for its university's mascot. And all this during the Reagan years, when federal aid to states and cities was subject to draconian cuts--cuts that made it impossible for most governors to win two terms, let alone five.</span></p> <p><span>Now Clinton offers this breadth of experience--far and away more than any of his rivals--to the nation. He seems to have a plan to cure everything except George Bush's sliding popularity.</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>ITH THE END of the Cold War and a sluggish economy, middle class Americans have turned their attention to their declining standard of living. Unfortunately, the ignored phrases from 1988 about the growing chasm between rich and poor are only now receiving a proper hearing.</span></p> <p><span>For over a decade, America's poor and politically powerless have lived with Reagan-Bush policies which redirected social spending to a military buildup and which sought to retrain no one for a new world economy.</span></p> <p><span>Clinton won't make the same mistakes. But he knows that to stay competitive, the Keynesian deficit spending offered by New Deal and Great Society-era programs cannot work. Were America the unquestioned economic leader of the world, a plan to return to such programs might make at least some sense.</span></p> <p><span>But the borrow and spend Reagan-Bush years have created a burgeoning deficit that constantly chips away at America's competitiveness by decreasing the pool of funds available for investment and growth. As manufacturing jobs have been lost, little has been done to restructure the economy to create new jobs in competitive industries.</span></p> <p><span>In this changing world economy, we must have a new plan. Clinton, we believe, has the best one offered by the Democrats.</span></p> <p><span><b>C</b>LINTON'S roots are populist, and he has not forgotten about the people most disaffected by the Reagan years--people whose votes, of course, he would love to win. But even if it's just unctuous political rhetoric, Clinton's concern for these people is missing from the plan offered by Paul E. Tsongas.</span></p> <p><span>While Tsongas has become the yuppie/suburb candidate (just last Saturday in South Carolina, he beat Clinton only among voters making more than $75,000), Clinton has reached out to the middle-and low-income families who suffered most under Reagan and Bush. And with his rhetoric come innovative and logical ideas.</span></p> <p><span>He would hike the top tax bracket for those earning more than $200,000--those who have received huge windfalls in tax breaks during the Reagan-Bush years. With this money, he would spark a short-term jump in the economy by cutting taxes for those earning less than $70,000.</span></p> <p><span>Unlike Tsongas, he would not provide more breaks for the rich with deep cuts in the capital gains tax. Tsongas \"probusiness\" message sounds a lot like Ronald Reagan's If we cut those nasty corporate taxes, all the friendly business execs will trickle higher wages down to their workers and start up lots of new factories.</span></p> <p><span>No good. Blanket cuts in capital gains taxes raise corporate profits and executive salaries, not the GNP. Clinton would target capital gains tax cuts only for original investment, thereby encouraging firms to restructure and retrain employees for light manufacturing and technology--the areas in which the U.S. is most competitive.</span></p> <p><span>To be sure, there are few other major differences between the Clinton and Tsongas visions. Both would provide tax credits for research and development, both support some version of free trade that would avoid the protectionist wars other candidates might prompt, both are committed to reducing the deficit. In addition, both are solidly pro-choice and both offer similar environmental and foreign affairs policies.</span></p> <p><span>But Clinton has the advantage of having implemented many of his ideas already. Furthermore, he has offered specifics on cutting military programs (one-third of the defense budget would be cut over the next five years) while Tsongas has waffled on actual figures.</span></p> <p><span>And although Tsongas' domestic economic plan would surely help business, it lacks the apprenticeship programs, loans to low-income entrepreneurs and expanded earned income tax credits that would make it easier for America's poor to attain resources lost in the last decade--or never even created.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>FTER Bill Clinton lost the governor's race in 1980 (and before coming back in '82), he told the Florida democratic convention how to win an election: \"If your opponent picks up a hammer at you,\" he said, \"you need to pick up a meat ax and cut off his arm.\"</span></p> <p><span>As the last few weeks have shown, Clinton has incredible political resilience. In 1988 he told Dukakis to firm up his attacks on the president, but the Massachusetts governor's unwillingness to fight back cost him the election.</span></p> <p><span>Now the '92 nomination has come down to Clinton and Tsongas, and Democrats across the country must realize that they have to pick the one who can beat Bush, whose dismal presidency cannot continue.</span></p> <p><span>Bush has watched cities decline into poverty and violence with no national funding and leadership to help. His education proposals came late and lacked the requisite funding--ditto for his bare-bones health care \"policy.\" He has tightened the definition of wetlands and threatened to authorize off-shore drilling. He has nominated right-wingers to the Supreme Court who will try to overturn Roe v. Wade this summer.</span></p> <p><span>The Bush presidency has been disastrous for the country--the point is that he must lose on November 3. So any Democratic nominee who would allow a Bush win must not receive the nomination.</span></p> <p><span>Paul Tsongas would allow a Bush win. The president could easily blast him out of the South, where he is currently known only in Republican-dominated Florida. This would leave the race up to the battleground states of 1988--the industrial Midwest and California.</span></p> <p><span>Tsongas couldn't get a labor endorsement to save his life. Unions would withhold support in a race between Bush and Tsongas, removing a huge part of the Democratic base in the Midwest.</span></p> <p><span>And Tsongas has little organization and few endorsements in California, leaving the sugar daddy of Electoral College votes for Bush, who won there in 1988.</span></p> <p><span>Even now, at the height of Tsongas popularity, his own aides acknowledge that the campaign is struggling for stability. In Florida, Tsongas best hope for a Southern upset, he has found it difficult to strike back at his opponents attacks. Bush would exploit this weakness mercilessly. He did in 1988.</span></p> <p><span>Finally, in the general election, Tsongas would have to battle Bush for the votes of the upper-income people who have given him Democratic primary successes. Bush will win the rich vote hands down.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>DMITTEDLY, we are discouraged by Clinton's immoral and anachronistic support of the death penalty. But Tsongas' unfortunate backing of capital punishment deemphasizes this issues in the primary.</span></p> <p><span>In the end, as Bob Kerrey said when he bowed out of the race last week, Bush must be the number one target. Bill Clinton has the ideas and the political savvy to pull off a defeat of the president. Therefore, we endorse Clinton in today's primary.</span></p> <p><span>In this election, Bush should get ready for the meat ax.</span></p>"}

Moonbeam\" shouldn't be elected. We disagree.</span></p> <p><span>Sure some of Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr.'s history and campaign tactics seem a little too laid back. But among the three major Democratic candidates remaining in the race, the former California governor has the best vision of what America can be. A fairer, cleaner, more livable home for all Americans. And let there be no doubt--Jerry Brown is a serious candidate.</span></p> <p><span>Brown's plan for improving the economy does not capitulate to the desires of Big Business as do those of former Massachusetts Sen. Paul E. Tsongas and Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton.</span></p> <p><span>Brown would cut the bloated, post-Cold-War defense budget by half and invest the savings in programs to put Americans to work.</span></p> <p><span>Jerry Brown would not only encourage research and development with tax credits, but he also would lean on companies to produce their discoveries in American factories.</span></p> <p><span>While Brown was governor, over fifty thousand students participated in the California Conservation Corps, which put them to work improving the state's infrastructure. While Brown was governor, more new jobs were created in California than there are people in Arkansas. And flat-tax rates do not equal flatearth thinking. His proposal would restore simplicity, efficiency and fairness to the convoluted, corrupted American tax system.</span></p> <p><span>Brown also knows that the only long-term way to improve the economy is by improving the educational system. He is the only candidate who will work for the elimination of the two-tier educational system--working so that inner-city youths may someday receive the same quality education as rich suburbanites.</span></p> <p><span>Brown knows that one of the most important ways for disadvantaged children to get ahead is by participating in the Head Start Program. That's why he wants to spend $2 billion to cover everyone eligible for the program who is not now able to take advantage of it.</span></p> <p><span>And Brown knows that college students need to receive more scholarship money and fewer loans. College students should not graduate with debt but with a clean slate and hope for the future.</span></p> <p><span>No other candidate has been as articulate on the environment as Brown. Although Bush promised be the \"environmental president,\" Brown is one of the few candidates in the last decade who could rightfully claim that title.</span></p> <p><span>Brown successfully stopped off-shore drilling in California, added hundreds of thousands of acres to the California park system, and appropriated millions of dollars for the protection of endangered wildlife. As governor, Brown successfully passed the toughest antismog laws in the country and put his state in the lead in utilizing new technologies to preserve the environment.</span></p> <p><span>Brown will tackle issues of global warming, toxic waste and the deterioration of our natural resources. These are issues that are easy to put aside for another day. Jerry Brown will ensure that does not happen.</span></p> <p><span>But even if you disagree, and don't believe that Jerry Brown is right on all the issues, it is time to send a message to the other Democratic contenders. We do not want another Republican. We want a candidate in tune with the issues, beliefs, and aspirations of the American left.</span></p> <p><span>Jerry Brown has the passion and the ability to carry out the traditional agenda of the left--from the death penalty to gay rights to the right to work.</span></p> <p><span>Brown will not go away. Unlike the other major candidates, Brown does not depend on the deep pockets of the vested interests. He is above the pandering of the other contenders. He is putting politics back into the hands of the people. He will carry their message all the way to New York.</span></p> <p><span>Give your support to Brown's insurgent campaign. We urge you to vote for Jerry Brown today.</span></p>"}

{"title": "The Origins of Karate in Government | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The Capitol Steps is like a college singing group gone wild. Wildly crazy, wildly professional and, of course, wildly political.</span></p> <p><span>As their recent March 7 one-night stand at Sanders Theater proved once again, when it comes to political satire at its funniest and most musical, this group of former and present legislative aides are masters.</span></p> <p><span>The three founders, Elaina Newport, Bill Strauss and Jim Aidala, presented the first version of The Capitol Steps at a Senate office Christmas party in 1981. \"Like most things in Congress,\" the program announces, \"they never knew when to stop.\" The Steps' reputation expanded beyond their Washington audience and victims, and they are now heard regularly on National Public Radio.</span></p> <p><span>Last week's show was the usual blend of acerbic wit and creatively outrageous expropriations of popular songs. Songs like \"Stand By Your Klan\" and \"If I Weren't a Rich Man\" (with George Bush singing) are merely the beginning. Strauss and Newport steal songs from the thirties--\"Forget Your Rubles, Come On Get Preppy,\" disco--\"Keep Him Alive\" (a prayer for the President), and even summer camp as a Palestinian delegate to the peace process sings \"Hello, Mullah, hello Fatah, here I am at intifada.\"</span></p> <p><span>The sold-out crowd at Sanders was clearly in a mood to enjoy some election-year bashing. Buchanan described some of his favorite things (outlawing welfare, deporting Haitians, \"basketball teams should employ more Caucasians\") while the Democrats listened to \"the Tsounds of Tsongas.\" (\"Hello voters, my old friends, I've come to give the same speech again.\")</span></p> <p><span>The most popular candidates of the evening, however, are not on any ballot. At the climax of Hillary Clinton and Barbara Bush's duet about campaign woes, \"Can't Love Helping That Man Of Mine,\" they sang \"Let's ditch both our misters and I'll run with you.\" From the tumultuous applause they received, it was clear the audience thought it was a great idea. <i>Lori E. Smith</i></span></p> <p><span><b>Don't Start No Beef Or Broccoli</b></span></p> <p><span>Mixing straight rap and dance hall sounds with a lyrical barrage of references to martial arts movies and pop culture in general, Fu-Schnickens throw a big party on their debut album, <i>F.U.--Don't Take It Personal.</i></span></p> <p><span>From the opening track, \"True Fuschnick,\" this group makes it clear that they're out to have a good time. The three rappers--Chip FU, Poc FU and Moc FU--introduce themselves with distinctive vocal styles, and the fun begins. Each soloist raps in a call-and-response dialogue with the rest of the group, creating a frenetic atmosphere which never lets up.</span></p> <p><span>The rollicking lyrics keep the music light and fast-paced. The group makes incessant allusions to pop culture, focusing on martial arts films but including everything from professional wrestling to cartoons.</span></p> <p><span>The martial arts theme is most fully developed in \"Movie Scene.\" A hilarious movie parody dissolves into crazy beats while Chip FU gives hardcore lines a different flavor with lyrics such as \"So don't try to test Chip FU you fantail shrimp/What are you, Bullwinkle or Rocky/Don't start no beef or broccoli/So give it up, you lost/Or you better duck sauce.\"</span></p> <p><span>In addition to the group's own performances, the album features some memorable posse cuts. Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest appears on the song \"La Schmoove,\" showing that his solid work on <i>The Low End Theory</i> was not a fluke. And Dres from Black Sheep makes a cameo on \"Check It Out.\" \u00a0\u00a0<i>--Daniel J. Sharfstein</i></span></p> <p><span><b>Less Than ORIGINal</b></span></p> <p><span>The Origin deliver a tight but unimpressive performance on their new album, <i>Bend.</i> While the group plays well and the rhythm section is solid, the group sounds as if they are right out of the '60s. The old acoustic-guitar-and-organ formula is tired and self-indulgent.</span></p> <p><span>Occasionally, a track on the album shows some force.

{"title": "Who's Next? | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>S</b>HE WAS only twelve years-old at the time, but Lillian Kimura still remebers that day in March 50 years ago when she and her family were herded into Manzanar, one of several internment camps scattered across the West Coast.</span></p> <p><span>Kimura and over a hundred thousand other Japanese-American citizens were falsely told by Earl Warren (who was attorney general of California at the time) that these barbed-wire outlets were a military necessity, that they were not being punished but protected, that Japanese Americans would thank the government later for the abrupt curtailment of their most basic human liberties.</span></p> <p><span>Japanese Americans didn't believe these half-truths then, and they don't today.</span></p> <p><span>They survived these camps better than could be expected. Those of the older generation perhaps repeated to themselves the Japanese expression <i>shyoganai</i>--that one should make the best of an impossible situation.</span></p> <p><span>But this did not take away the hurt and anger that Kimura and others in these internment camps felt when their rights were stripped away, when the country they would fight and die for--as many of them later did--labeled them the enemies.</span></p> <p><span>Rather than acknowledging these human rights abuses, many Americans have chosen to commemorate the internment's 50th anniversary with a hatred and cynicism similar to that which motivated the internment itself. Judging from the recent nationwide spate of anti-Japanese and anti-Asian hate crimes, racism remains as insidious today as it was 50 years ago.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HIS NEW, more subtle form of racism is cloaked in part by fallacious economic arguments. The Japanese, the reasoning goes, are to blame for our recent economic stagnation. Their trade practices are not only discriminatory but hostile to Americans. They are suspiciously buying up large chunks of American real estate, even our movie industry.</span></p> <p><span>The underlying message is frighteningly clear: the Japanese can't be trusted. They're taking over our country.</span></p> <p><span>This basic distrust is articulated in the language of war and conspiracy. The Japanese don't contribute to the U.S. trade deficit with superior products--they are carrying out some master plan. Japanese investments--which actually employ hundreds of American workers--begin to take on the overtones of a plot.</span></p> <p><span>Looking at recent book titles about Japan, a disturbing pattern emerges: <i>The Coming War with Japan, Yen! Japan's New Financial Empire and its Threat to America.</i></span></p> <p><span>Then there's the recent book by Pat Choate, <i>Agents of Influence,</i>which claims Japanese thought is beginning to take control of our universities. American professors, corrupted by Japanese research money, don't reveal the Japanese for who or what they really are.</span></p> <p><span>But Japan, of course, is not the source of all our economic problems. While there is much that is unfair about the United State's economic relationship with Japan, most of our woes can be traced to our domestic troubles.</span></p> <p><span>We don't often read about the considerable progress Japan has made in opening its markets over the last decade--its imports, most might be surprised to know, are the third-highest in the world. We don't hear that Japan pours huge sums of money into long-term domestic investments like infrastructure and education.</span></p> <p><span>These realities were completely ignored during President Bush's recent trip to Asia. More intent on political posturing than negotiating an agreement, Bush brought with him three of the worst examples of American business--the CEOs of America's top automakers. Intended as a show of American strength, the Bush's decision to bring these corporate gluttons to Japan must have made the Japanese laugh.</span></p> <p><span><b>V</b>EILED ATTEMPTS to paint Japan as an enemy rather than as a worthy economic competitor might serve to unite and even temporarily spur our country out of its economic malaise. But whether it succeeds or not, such political and economic deception has terrible consequences for Japanese Americans and other minority groups.</span></p> <p><span>Japan-bashing is slowly becoming recognized for its hurtful impact on the lives of thousands of Americans--Japanese Americans. A recent report by the Federal Civil Rights Commission called on presidential candidates to stop using \"race-baiting\" tactics and \"talking talk tough on trade\" when such appeals are made in the subtle language of racism.</span></p> <p><span>But the mandate from our political and business leaders to bash and blame the Japanese has already created grave problems for Americans of Japanese descent.</span></p> <p><span>In Los Angeles last month, Yasuo Kato, a recent immigrant from Japan, was found stabbed to death in his garage. A few weeks prior to the murder, Kato had been threatened in his home by two men who told him, \"I know you're Japanese and I think we have a right to take money from you because our economy is hurting from your people.\"</span></p> <p><span>And recently in Boston, Iwao Matsuda, the president of a Japanese university, was found murdered in his Back Bay hotel room. He had been visiting the country to formalize a \"sister school\" relationship with the University of Massachusetts in Boston. Was this just another random murder? The timing, at least, was perfect: a day before the internment's Day of Rememberance on February 19, when President Roosevelt handed down the order to begin internment of the Japanese.</span></p> <p><span>And these irrationally motivated hate crimes extend beyond attacks against Japanese. Anti-Japanese sentiment becomes hate against Chinese Americans, Korean Americans, Filipinos and other ethnic groups. \"Whatever animosity they have towards Asia affects all of us. The can't tell us apart,\" said Kimura, who is the president of the New York chapter of the Japanese American Citizens League.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE HARVARD community itself is far from immune from these senseless hate crimes. Recently, a slur against Chinese Americans was found on the Lamont Poetry Board, and prank callers have attacked non-Asians and Asians alike, hurling racial slurs like \"Korean bitch.\"</span></p> <p><span>For the victims of these assaults, the insinuation of a Japanese conspiracy begs the question: Who is conspiring against whom? Are the conspirators deceitful Japanese businessmen in suits? Or are the people who propagate these stereotypes and misconceptions--who insist that \"they,\" whoever \"they\" might be, are the reason for \"our\" problems--the true culprits?</span></p> <p><span>Many other incidents of racial prejudice and harrassment go unreported. Perhaps victims have faith that things will eventually get better--the attitude expressed in <i>shyoganai.</i> This way of thinking did allow many Japanese Americans to assuage their anguish when discrimination took the form of barbed wire and loyalty tests.</span></p> <p><span>But <i>shyogania,</i> as before, cannot purge the fear and resentment many Asian Americans feel today over this recurring pattern of racial blame. This time, many are saying they won't tolerate such crimes.</span></p> <p><span>For the Japanese internment survivors, and for the victims of recent anti-Asian hate crimes, the usual explanations for racial violence and discrimination ring hollow. The standard refrain--that racial scapegoating happens when our economy goes sour--seems like just another glib justification for pain and injustice.</span></p> <p><span>For these survivors, the essential questions remain unaswered: Why the Japanese? Why Asians? Who is next?</span></p> <p><span>These are the questions that Lillian Kimura, the families of Iwao Matsuda and Yasuo Kato and countless other Asian Americans are still asking themselves today.</span></p>"}

I knew enough about Buchanan's politics to know I couldn't support him (I have watched one too many \"McLaughlin Group\" shows). But deceived by this rarefied political atmosphere that we all call home--I had thought that nobody else would really take him seriously either.</span></p> <p><span>Sure, he had done well in New Hampshire, but like many of my friends, I had viewed his coup as a negative vote against Bush--\"the best thing the Democrats have going for them...\" and all that. It just didn't seem possible to me that he could inspire a real groundswell of populist support.</span></p> <p><span>But, as my mom knows, things are never that simple. In states throughout the South, Buchanan is relishing in an outrageous, showman-like campaign. He bases his strategy on a brand of \"protest\" aimed at white Southern Democrats who, like their counterparts here in the Northeast, are facing unemployment and uncertainty in the wake of Bush's \"broken promises.\"</span></p> <p><span>Just like the rest of the country, the South needs new ideas and initiatives to solve the racial, economic, and social problems that are accompanying its rapid growth and \"modernization.\"</span></p> <p><span>But no one likes to work too hard and Buchanan knows it. In a region known, in the first place, for its conservatism, Buchanan is running on the time-tested platform of stasis. He is taking his political cues from a distinctly 1960s brand of segregationist politician--from men like George Wallace and Lester Maddox. Buchanan's message throws Southerners back some 30 years. And alarmingly, he is coming through loud and clear.</span></p> <p><span><b>H</b>ERE ARE SOME scenes from Buchanan's Southern campaign:</span></p> <p><span>While stumping in Georgia, Buchanan told one group of small-town supporters in Perry, (Senator Sam Nunn's hometown) that the Voting Acts Right of 1965 was \"an act of regional discrimination against the South.\"</span></p> <p><span>The Atlanta Journal and Constitution pointed out, in a March 1 article, that \"the Voting Rights Act in general has aided Southern Republicans.\" This was the act that banned discrimination at the ballot box and enforced compliance with the 15th Amendment.</span></p> <p><span>Many groups have been protesting Presidents Day lately because the founding fathers were slave owners. Did you know that Buchanan had slave holding ancestors? He \"bragged\" of his family history in a speech to one group.</span></p> <p><span>And don't forget states' rights. On one stop during his campaign jaunt, you could practically see Fort Sumter blowing up in the background. The Atlanta Journal and Constitution was there:</span></p> <p><span>\"Later in the day, after admiring the Stone Mountain carvings of Gen. Robert E. Lee, Gen. Stonewall Jackson and Confederate President Jefferson Davis, [Buchanan] told reporters, \"We should have no second-class citizens in America and no second-class states.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>P</b>ROGRESSIVE WHITE Southerners are scared by Buchanan's campaigning success. Two Democrats and a Republican--former Louisiana Governor Buddy Roemer, Georgia Governor Zell Miller and South Carolina Governor Carroll Campbell-blasted the Challenger's campaign tactics on Sunday morning television. And it's no accident that the Journal and Constitution article covering the Buchanan campaign ended with an excerpt from a conversation between the candidate and Robin Jackson, the president of the Houston county NAACP:</span></p> <p><span>\"You're for civil rights? Mr. Jackson asked.</span></p> <p><span>\"I'm for equal rights, my friend' said Mr. Buchanan, who then recounted a story about how as a teenager he defended a black high school athlete.</span></p> <p><span>At the end of the conversation, Mr. Jackson said. \"Don't mess with civil rights. Don't do that to us.'\"</span></p> <p><span>Even white Southerners who don't seem so progressive are a little uncomfortable. Take, for example, Durwood McAlister, former editor of the editorial pages of the Atlanta \"Covers Dixie Like the Dew\" Journal, He wrote in a column entitled, \"Buchanan's Style is Ugly\":</span></p> <p><span>\"But Pat Buchanan Jacks the key ingredient that was the saving grace of the rogues we remember fondly. He is without charm.</span></p> <p><span>His style is more like the knife-in-the-gut meanness of Joe McCarthy than the deft ridicule used so successfully be George Wallace and Marvin Griffin.</span></p> <p><span>It won't work in Georgia. A little negative campaigning is fine; but gutter politics, unrelieved by either wit or charm, will be, and should be, rejected.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>N</b>OW, OF COURSE, I don't present McAlister's reasoning as a resounding rejection of Buchanan's candidacy. But the other protests--and my mother's concerns--have a lot of validity.</span></p> <p><span>It's easy for us to get excited when a relatively \"popular\" incumbent's hold begins to crumble. But we shouldn't forget that, whether Buchanan himself is racist or not, his campaign definitely is--and its influence over voters in the South is extremely dangerous. If we're really as concerned about racism and other backwards attitudes in the South as last year's Confederate flag debate would show us to be, then we should scream and yell about Buchanan too.</span></p> <p><span>Because for voters around the South, Buchanan is definitely <i>not</i> \"the Democrats' best friend.\" Instead, he's helping Southern Democrats--prime crossover voters--to further isolate themselves from the rest of the modern world.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Vote Buchanan for Real Leadership | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>P</b>AT IN '92:</span></p> <p><span><i>\"They have no vision. They have no ideas. They are frightened of the truth. They are frightened of debate.\"</i></span></p> <p><span>Pat Buchanan said these words about President Bush and his surrogates yesterday, but they fit the staff pretty well, too. The staff's piece says a lot more about the people who wrote it than it does about Buchanan: What they can't win on the field of principle and belief, they prefer to steal through slander. Pathetically (and altogether predictably), the staff attempts to equate Buchanan with Duke. But ridiculous charges aside, Buchanan is a candidate worthy of being judged by his ideas. So let's take a look.</span></p> <p><span>First, Buchanan is the only candidate who understands nationalism--not only ours, but other people.' Far from being an \"isolationist,\" Buchanan called for the immediate recognition of Slovenia, Croatia, Ukraine and the Baltics when those nations declared independence from their communist oppressors. And he is the only candidate who won't hide behind tired, reactionary calls for \"stability\" when Quebec secedes from Canada later this year, or when devolution becomes a reality in Scotland.</span></p> <p><span>Forging a victory in 1988 based on clear-cut opposition to taxes and quotas, Bush signed legislation that mandated both. Deepening recession followed swiftly behind. Still, Bush really thinks that the current recession is just a run of bad luck, that it will soon blow over like so many campaign promises. In short, he simply has no clue.</span></p> <p><span>Buchanan does. Buchanan supports tax cuts, and an eventual flat-tax rate. He would immediately move to abolish the capital gains tax, which would free up both short-term and long-term investment (as in Japan and Taiwan). More important, Buchanan would initiate an immediate, all-out search-and-destroy mission to cripple federal regulation on business and industry, which would free our economy from its current socialistic shackles.</span></p> <p><span>Finally, like the old Ronald Reagan, Buchanan would be a real leader. Speechwriter and aide to three presidents, Buchanan is an insider to the world of executive decision making, but an outsider to the world of get-along-to-go-along congressional compromise. That means no more corrupt budget deals. No more quota bills. No surrender to those who would rather steal their way to public policy success than argue their case before the American people.</span></p> <p><span>If you want more of the same (whatever that is), vote for George Bush. Or if you want slightly worse, then vote for a Democrat.</span></p> <p><span>If you want real leadership and a practical vision for America, vote for Pat.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Fight the Power? | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>Y</b>OU KNOW YOU'RE a president in trouble when...the Comedy Channel carries your State of the Union address with live commentary. When you have to make self-deprecating remarks in that address about yarfing at a state dinner. When you go to New Hampshire and get so giddy with that down-home-in-Texas crap that you babble obtusely about the \"Nitty Ditty Gritty Nitty Dirt Band.\"</span></p> <p><span>Yes, it's been a glorious few weeks. It's been a time in which the once (and probably still) impossible hope of a Democratic win has actually looked plausible. Still, amid the stupidity and humor of Bush's difficulties--the very fuel of those hopes--there's more at stake. Some profound changes for our politics--or at least long-lasting trends--lurk underneath the quirky fissures in Bush's support network.</span></p> <p><span>Among the more intractable and trend-revealing problems:</span></p> <p><span><i>George Bush versus the White House.</i> John Sununu's still on the payroll in the West Wing, and everyone still hates him. Even so, the new chief of staff, Sam Skinner, is holding a tight leash on his predecessor. Since December, CNN has been trying to get Sununu to take Buchanan's place on \"Crossfire\" (or simply to appear on a show), but he always has to \"check with Sam,\" and Sam never lets him play.</span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile, Skinner is not much better than Sununu was at improving the president's image. The Japan trip was a fiasco, and Skinner let budget director Richard G. Darman talk Bush into stalling on new economic proposals until last Tuesday, during the State of the Union address. The yearly snoozer of a speech was probably watched by lots of people. Some may have even paid attention. None will remember it.</span></p> <p><span>In the meantime, Bush was stuck lamely with saying things like, \"I probably have made mistakes in assessing the fact that the economy would recover.... I think I've known, look, this economy is in freefall. I hope I've known it.\"</span></p> <p><span>Even considering the huge lexicon of Bush misstatements, this is particularly idiotic. To take even partial blame for the economic decline--and to use the harsh terms of the Democrats to describe it--is suicidal in a state reeling as much as New Hampshire. He should beat up on Congress, liberals and anyone else who comes to mind. Just not himself.</span></p> <p><span>All of this delicious confusion may help (minimally, at least) to defeat Bush next November, but it's symptomatic of larger problems.</span></p> <p><span>Bush's is the de Tocqueville presidency. The model is simple--get a bunch of rich, white, big-headed blowhards together, mostly lawyers, to run a country too complex for all those smelly voters. Not only does their silly bickering effectively shut out from Bush's narrow view the troubles and concerns of minorities and women. It's also a stupid, inefficient way to run a government.</span></p> <p><span>And instead of reinvigorating the place with new faces and new ideas, Bush seems to insist on hiring only those who've passed some absurd loyalty test.</span></p> <p><span>Witness the appointment last week of Massachusetts native Andrew H. Card to replace Skinner at the Department of Transportation. In the 1988 race, Card urged Bush to use the Willie Horton story and Michael Dukakis's veto of the Pledge of Allegiance bill when both had been largely forgotten. They were winners. Loyalty oath passed.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>G</i></b>EORGE BUSH versus Pat Buchanan. The latest polls (by the American Research Group, a New Hampshire firm) show the isolationist and \"probably\" anti-Semitic (William F. Buckley's conclusion--not mine, which would have been something like \"Goebbelsesque\") Patrick J. Buchanan to have broken the 30 percent mark.</span></p> <p><span>Of course, 30 percent isn't a win. It's not really close. But Buchanan's numbers will probably go up, and Bush's will keep sliding. Former Nixon speechwriter Buchanan has bought tons of TV time in New Hampshire (about three and a half hours, according to The New York Times)--more than even the well-financed Bill Clinton.</span></p> <p><span>On the other hand, Bush has bought <i>nada</i> so far. In fact, the president plans only two more swings through the state before the primary on February 18.</span></p> <p><span>In addition, Buchanan has the staunch support of The Manchester Union-Leader, the only major state-wide newspaper. In a front-page editorial January 22, the paper unequivocally endorsed Buchanan (they actually printed the endorsement sentence in bold type), citing cartoonishly his belief \"that America should be first\" and \"that we should remove ourselves from all foreign entanglements except for those that directly benefit the United States.\"</span></p> <p><span>Finally, Buchanan is not a bad campaigner. Earlier this month, he showed up at what one might expect to be a hostile arena for a right-winger--an Ivy League school. But according to David M. Herszenhorn, a reporter for The Dartmouth, Buchanan's visit to the Big Green received \"surprisingly positive\" reaction.</span></p> <p><span>\"Some critical questions were asked,\" Herszenhorn said, \"and some people tried to get him to admit to being racist or sexist or homophobic.\" But Buchanan has learned the political game too well. He walked out with \"appreciative\" praise.</span></p> <p><span>From a let's-beat-Bush-At-All-Costs perspective, I hope Buchanan will rake in around 37 percent. The last few decades show that no incumbent can give up that much in New Hampshire and still go on to win in November--Jimmy Carter, Gerald Ford and Lyndon Johnson (who actually quit the race when Eugene McCarthy bagged 40 percent in the Granite state) are recent examples.</span></p> <p><span>But in the hopes that Buchanan will steal Bush's fire, we can't forget that he has shown us in recent national polls that cleaned up David Duke rhetoric can appeal nationally. Too harsh? I'll grant that Buchanan is obviously not an avowed Nazi, but too often putting \"America first\" seems to mean we must accept the white Catholic values he grew up with as those of a patriotic America.</span></p> <p><span>Only Jews wanted to fight the Gulf War, he said last year. As Michael E. Kinsley '72 pointed out recently, he thinks Americans sympathize with Russians because they, like \"us,\" are \"white people.\"</span></p> <p><span>It's not uncommon for politicians to blame ethnic and racial minorities for poor economic times. Like the Bush administration infighting, the attack on Bush from the right may help defeat the president in the fall. But also like the White House wrangling, the rebirth of the politics of race and isolation in America warn of deeper problems.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>G</i></b>EORGE BUSH versus the Supreme Court. Last week, the mostly Reagan-Bush Court agreed to hear a Pennsylvania case that could possibly result in the reversal of <i>Roe V. Wade.</i> More bad news.</span></p> <p><span>The 1989 <i>Webster</i> case from Missouri, which only weakened Roe, is credited with giving Democrats Jim Florio and Douglas Wilder the edge in their narrow elections that fall.</span></p> <p><span>But with the additions of David H. Souter '61 and Clarence Thomas, the Court is even more conservative than in 1989. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's middle-of-the-road tie-breaking position prevented an overturn in 1989, when four justices were prepared for reversal and four were opposed. Now two of four supporters of <i>Roe</i> are gone.</span></p> <p><span>The Court usually adjourns for a break in June or July, and since arguments for this case won't begin until April, the Court probably won't rule until just before leaving for the beach.</span></p> <p><span>An overturn of Roe next summer would surely set the tone for the July and August nominating conventions in New York and Houston--as civil rights issues did in 1948 and as the Vietnam War did in 1968. The difference is that this time, the Republicans will have the convention-floor bloodbath. And the Democrats will benefit.</span></p> <p><span>But, again, at what cost? Perhaps the 1992 race will find a Democrat the victor partially because Roe is overturned. But the legacy of the Republican Right's Court will be the end of a women's right to choose--far more important for many than the legacy of the 1992 election.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HESE SHORT-TERM MISSTEPS are both cause and symptom of a failed presidency. Of course, later this year--say, around the time George Bush turns 68 in July, when short-term remedies bring the economy up a bit and when the Bush campaign is running full-speed--Bush won't look so bad. Few will remember the poor appointments, the unwillingness to create a long-term economic strategy, the erstwhile Buchanan challenge.</span></p> <p><span>But the long-term consequences of his difficulties will still be around. And unfortunately, so will George Bush.</span></p>"}

Bush pledged to \"do the utmost possible\" on AIDS research.</span></p> <p><span>Johnson, the former Los Angeles Lakers basketball star who retired after contracting the AIDS-causing virus, compared the war on the deadly disease to a championship game that needs \"a full court press.\"</span></p> <p><span>He told Bush in a letter, \"No matter how good the team may be, it won't win the championship without the owner fully in the game.  I don't feel you've been there up until now.\"</span></p> <p><span>Johnson said he personally feels healthy, runs four miles daily and plans to compete this summer on the U.S. Olympic basketball team.</span></p> <p><span>He gave Bush his letter in the Oval Office following Johnson's first meeting as a member of the National Commission on AIDS.

He's said that himself, that he hasn't been involved.  He's going to have to allocate more money and get more involved.\"</span></p> <p><span>The former basketball star's letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press, urged federal spending increases in the next two years, including:  $900 million for National Institutes of Health research, $900 million to fully fund treatment programs under congressional legislation named for child AIDS victim Ryan White, and $500 million for Medicaid payments for care of those infected with the HIV virus.</span></p> <p><span>\"This early intervention would save millions of lives and billions of dollars,\" Johnson said of the proposal to allow Medicaid to pay for HIV victims in addition to those with full-fledged AIDS.</span></p> <p><span>Outside the White House, Johnson said of Bush, \"Everybody wants him to speak out more, and he needs to.  He's the most powerful man in the world.  If he speaks out and says that it's out here and he cares ... then people will listen.\"</span></p> <p><span>After their meeting, Bush said that Johnson had some \"good constructive suggestions.  We'll try to work on them.\"</span></p> <p><span>In a photo session before their meeting, Bush struck a defensive posture, saying the government already is spending $4.25 billion to fight AIDS.  However, he said he is consulting with the National Institutes of Health on whether more research money is needed.</span></p> <p><span>\"We will do the utmost possible,\" Bush said.  \"We will try to get the maximum research funding level possible.  If there's some place where you can put a little more money to get this problem solved, of course we want to be sensitive.\"</span></p> <p><span>Heading into their meeting, Bush praised Johnson's \"enormous contribution\" to AIDS education.</span></p> <p><span>Johnson said at the AIDS commission meeting, \"I want to do more.

{"title": "1-800-Vote-Brown | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b> HAD READ about \"Moonbeam\" Jerry Brown.  I had heard how this flaky former governor of California had traveled to the Far East to practice transcendental meditation.  And I had seen him in the first nationally televised debate between the Democratic presidential candidates, advertising himself like clearing houses advertise Country and Western CD collections.</span></p> <p><span>So, until I heard Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. speak at the Kennedy School of Government on December 16, I thought I had developed an accurate assessment of him:  unrealistic, anachronistic and obnoxious.  After listening to Brown for an hour, I've changed my mind.</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>HEN HE STARTED SPEAKING, I was skeptical to say the least.  He sounded disorganized, had no prepared speech and rushed right into his platform without any sort of introduction to \"warm up\" the audience.  Was <i>this</i> presidential material?</span></p> <p><span>Then it occurred to me:  I've become so conditioned by packaged candidates and manufactured candidacies that I generally view a politician negatively if he doesn't conform to this norm.  As Brown spoke, his disorganization soon gave way to a comfortable stream of messages.  So what if he had no introduction?  It didn't matter--Brown needed no gimmicky anecdote (like Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton's one about the cab driver) to start his speech.  He spoke directly to the audience and his face revealed startling sincerity.</span></p> <p><span>But was this presidential material?  In berating career politicians, Brown kept repeating.  \"There's a certain unreality here.\"  But the unreality I saw lay in his perception and approach.  I was hearing something I had only read about, seen in old Dennis Hopper movies, and heard my parents reminisce about:  unapologetic, furious and bitter establishment-bashing.  \"I don't enjoy taking a crowbar\" to the system, Brown said, but it was clear that he enjoyed it very much.</span></p> <p><span>So much, in fact, that I began to wonder how anyone who so hated the establishment could ever hope to govern effectively as part of it.  Come question-and-answer time, one woman vocalized my concern.  Brown's response--clearly unscripted--may have been one of the better soundbites of the night:  \"If the system isn't working, then is working with an unworking system...working?\"</span></p> <p><span>Great Jerry, I thought, but how do you make the system work?  That's exactly what his campaign is all about.  \"There's a world view here that needs to be shared,\" he proclaimed.  \"This is about saving this country's democracy.\"  Here, finally, is a candidate who seems genuinely committed to creating change, to revitalizing a process in which most of the electorate has lost faith.</span></p> <p><span>It was clear that his listeners sensed that committment.  They heard him lash out against Political Action Committees, incumbent politicians, Republicans, Democrats, defense spending and Tom Brokaw--and loved every minute of it.</span></p> <p><span>When Brown attacked the Senate for staying up until midnight to discuss the Savings and Loan bailout and asked why they couldn't do the same to discuss full funding for Headstart, his listeners agreed.  Like no speaker I had seen before, Jerry Brown spoke to his audience, and his audience heard him.</span></p> <p><span><b>S</b>TILL, was this presidential material?  I began to see the usefulness of his efforts and the electric attractiveness of his campaign, even if it fails.  His promise to wage \"an insurgent campaign\" is reminiscent of Abbie Hoffman, the 1960s radical and self-described \"American dissident.\"  Like Hoffman, Brown is unashamed to knock the establishment, unashamed to appeal to the people's sense of \"what's right.\"</span></p> <p><span>Whether or not he wins the Democratic nomination, his campaign will direct the American people's attention to the lopsided priorities of our current leadership.  He speaks about \"restructuring attitudes,\" and seems to favor restructuring the political system.  He points out incongruencies in Bush's foreign policy, and advocates a policy based on compassion.</span></p> <p><span>Here is a leader with firm, unwavering convictions, who refuses to base his beliefs on the numbers produced by the pollsters.  After four years under George Bush, a man with absolutely no beliefs so strong that they can't be reversed by a drop in the polls, it would be nice to have someone who isn't ideologically empty.  I doubt Brown can singlehandedly overhaul the attitudes of Americans, but I see nothing wrong with giving him a chance to try.</span></p> <p><span>As for pragmatism, Governor \"Moonbeam\" is not as flaky as the press would have you think.  Beneath the impassioned cries for revolution lies a practical approach to government:  He articulates coherent energy policy ideas and supports his arguments about defense spending with statistics.  Behind his eloquent calls for reform are serious facts that lend credence to his proposals.</span></p> <p><span>He speaks the language of the masses, but has the knowledge of a leader.  Indeed, his popularity probably comes as much from his revolution-minded rhetoric as it does from his relaxed rapport with his audience.</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>HEN BROWN ANNOUNCED--twice--during the December debate that he had established a toll-free number for contributors to call, and when (amid the protests of moderator Tom Brokaw) he told his viewers what that number was, I found him obnoxious.</span></p> <p><span>But the next night at the Kennedy School, I began to understand his point:  to wrench political influence from lobbyists and big-money campaign contributors and return it to the populace at large.  \"How many of you in this room have never given $1000 to a candidate?\"  he asked, and the question drove his point home.  (For those of you who are interested, the number--which \"so terrorizes the establishment\"--is 1-800-426-1112.)</span></p> <p><span>The Jerry Brown I saw at the Kennedy School last month was not the flake I had come to expect from press reports.  The Jerry Brown I saw seemed witty, impassioned, spontaneous, casual, eloquent, inspiring, sarcastic, serious, rebellious, astute, and--above all-honest.  What a refreshing change from the pre-packaged, poll-driven politicians we have come to expect and even admire.</span></p> <p><span>I don't entertain any illusions about Brown's ability to capture the Democratic nomination, much less the presidency.  But I intend to support him nonetheless.  After all, we could do much worse than to elect a passionate, sincere ideologue.  In 1988, we did.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Imagine That | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b>MAGINE THAT YOU are sitting in a classroom in Sever Hall on the morning of a big exam.  You have been tense for three days.  You didn't sleep very well last night.  You're rather nervous as the proctor passes out the blue books.</span></p> <p><span>Suddenly, a television crew enters the room, shines its lights and begins recording.  Your exam is being broadcast live throughout metropolitan Boston.  Until the test is over, you realize, your angst will be watched by whoever cares to see.</span></p> <p><span>If you are a reasonable person, you would probably be disconcerted by the camera crew's presence.  You might become more nervous than you had already been.  Conceivably, you might become distracted and confused during the exam, even if the material had been clear in your mind only hours earlier.</span></p> <p><span>Now suppose that, instead of a student taking an exam, you are a rape victim.  You have pressed charges and your case is going to trial.  Faced with a hostile attorney interrogating you about intimate and painful subjects, you tension is orders of magnitude greater than that of a student facing only an empty blue book.</span></p> <p><span>The consequences of distraction include wounding embarrassment--not to mention a rapist's going free and your being officially told, in effect, that you were not raped, no matter what you think.  And the cameras are there, and their audience is nationwide.</span></p> <p><span>In the wake of the Smith rape trial in Florida, the role of the mass media in American courtrooms must be reexamined.  Is it a good thing that a woman who claimed that she was raped had her blacked out face broadcast by every media outlet from CNN to Saturday Night Live?  If not, is it a necessary evil, the only alternative to which is government censorship?</span></p> <p><span>The answer to both questions is no.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HERE ARE TWO POSSIBLE ways to argue for intensive broadcast media coverage of trials, rape or otherwise.  One is consequentialist:  claiming that courts work better when they know they are being watched.  The other is categorical:  invoking a public right to know or a right to untrammeled free press.  As applied to events such as the Smith rape trial, neither of these arguments makes sense.</span></p> <p><span>First, consider the consequentialist argument, which is rooted in the knowledge that closed-door trials are Stalinist stuff.  Abuses of justice breed easily when nobody knows that the judges are doing.  Keeping trials open and public does not ensure that convictions and acquittals will not be based on arbitrary whim.  Without reporting on courtroom activities, the guardians of justice are themselves unguarded.</span></p> <p><span>But arguing for network teletrials because secret sentencing is bad is as brainless as urging rock climbers to carry 50-gallon water canteens.  If you go hiking in the sun, take some water, but don't take so much that you can't walk.</span></p> <p><span>If rape trials were secret, maybe more rapists would go free (which already happens all the time) and more innocent people would be convicted (which also happens, albeit less often).  Nobody is saying that the trials should be secret. Anyone who wants to can go watch, and all the proceedings are matters of public record.</span></p> <p><span>Everyone knows that the glare of television lights amplifies pressure and makes clear thinking more difficult.  Rape victims are nervous enough testifying in public courtrooms; describing one's own rape to total strangers, in the presence of the rapist, while a lawyer tries to destroy the testimony will make anyone tense enough.  CNN on the scene only makes it worse, and there is no \"openness\" interest to cut the other way.</span></p> <p><span>A television audience does not guarantee any higher a level of judicial integrity than that ensured by the audience physically present.  The consequentialist argument, then, actually works against TV trial coverage.</span></p> <p><span>Now, consider the categorical, rightbased argument, which includes the constitutional right of free press and the more abstract concept of the public's \"right to know.\"  Free press is serious business.  It is legally protected and vital to our open society.  And it is in no way abridged by keeping television cameras out of trial courts.</span></p> <p><span>Free press means that no government censor blacks out what the papers print or the networks broadcast.  It does not mean that journalists have carte blanche to impose themselves and their equipment wherever they choose.  No one has the right to install a camera in your bathroom for example.</span></p> <p><span>Yes, courtrooms are public places.  So is the Oval Office, and George Bush need not admit Sam Donaldson whenever Sam wants an interview.  Cambridge Rindge and Latin High School is a public place, and free press doesn't mean that Channel 5 can demand to broadcast geometry classes.  News crews could claim, plausibly, that unwatched teachers gets away with sloppy teaching and that public interest requires press coverage.  No government official will censor a story about poor math instruction in Massachusetts high schools.  But nobody expects 15-year olds to concentrate on trapezoids while the cameras roll.  And free press does not confer the right to try to make them.</span></p> <p><span>That leaves only the question of the public \"right to know,\" which would present a stirring challenge were it not for one minor problem:  there's no such thing.  We may want to know things about the world around us.  It may be good for us to know what happens in government.  We might be really, really curious to know the lurid details of a celebrity rape trial, so curious that newspapers figure they can sell a million copies by printing a fetishistic photo of a faceless (and therefore dehumanized) woman on the front page.</span></p> <p><span>That's just sensationalism.  It reflects only the dark corners of our minds, not any guaranteed \"right to know,\" which has absolutely no constitutional, judicial or other legal basis.  The \"right to know\" is at one with unicorns and Easter bunnies.  That's just not the foundation for a very solid argument.</span></p> <p><span><b>M</b>AYBE WILLIAM KENNEDY Smith was guilty of rape.  And maybe he wasn't.  The jury though not.  Suspect what we may, one way or another, we can't know for sure.  But now everyone in America knows that accusing a big name of rape invites a live broadcast carnival.  If you are raped by someone prominent and have the courage to press charges, you will not only go through the standard stress of deposition, cross-examination and other unpleasantries required by the legitimate right of the accused, but you will do it under the lights and in millions of kitchens and living rooms.</span></p> <p><span>Rape victims should have the right to know that they won't be subjected to this kind of treatment.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Soldier Says 'Thanks' to Harvard | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b> AM A 1986 GRADUATE of Harvard and a second-year student at Harvard Business School.  In addition, I received my commission as an Army officer through the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) while at Harvard and have been an officer in the U.S.  Army or Army Reserve ever since.</span></p> <p><span>Last fall, I was so outraged by Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait that I volunteered to serve in Operation Desert Shield.  I did this despite the fact that I was beginning my second year at the Business School.</span></p> <p><span>Last December, I was mobilized into the Army, leaving both Harvard and my wife, Diane behind.  I was sent to Saudi Arabia before the outbreak of the war in January and I served as a lieutenant in a Combat Engineer unit throughout Operation Desert Storm.  I was finally sent home to the United States in May.</span></p> <p><span>Although I served most of my time in the Saudi Arabian desert just south of Iraq and Kuwait, I was in Kuwait City last March, right after the end of the war.  Many others have written about the joy of the Kuwaiti people after their liberation, but I want to add some thoughts about the real meaning of one man's heart felt \"thank you.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>S YOU HAVE HEARD, the sky in Kuwait City was incredibly dark with oily black smoke and my urban surroundings were pock-marked by explosions and littered with debris, including the remains of Iraqi tanks.</span></p> <p><span>As I drove along a highway one day with a few of my soldiers, two Arab men pulled alongside out truck and waved for us to pull over.  We pulled our truck to one side of the road behind their car.  When we got out, one of the two Arabs came forward and hugged me saying, \"Thank you!  Thank you!  Because of you, we are free!\"</span></p> <p><span>I quickly learned that this Kuwaiti man had spent a number of years in the United States and had earned a masters degree at MIT before returning to Kuwait.  He and his family had spent the seven-month Iraqi occupation hiding in their apartment, eating whatever they could find.  None of his family members had been killed by the Iraqis, but friends of his had not been so lucky.</span></p> <p><span>Meeting this man and becoming the object of his appreciation made me feel wonderful.  In fact, many times when I felt the most depressed about being away from Diane for so long with absolutely no control over when I could finally come home, I remembered this Kuwaiti man and why I had come.</span></p> <p><span>However, I still felt self-conscious and embarrassed when he \"thanked\" me.  After all, I did not win the war.  I was just one of hundreds of thousands of Allied and American troops, just a lieutenant in a Combat Engineer unit.</span></p> <p><span>Looking back on it though, I remember President Bush's late-February speech to the people at Raytheon who manufacture Patriot missiles (I happened to hear it live one night on Armed Forces radio).  The President quoted Woodrow Wilson who said, \"It takes 10,000 jobs to win a war.\"</span></p> <p><span>Thinking about this, I realize that war is a tremendously collective effort.  Just as the people at Raytheon had their part, I, a guy from Harvard, had my little part, and everyone here at home who supported those of us actually serving in Desert Storm had their part too.</span></p> <p><span>Fortunately, there was no shortage of people from all segments of American life who were willing to share the burden, including here in the Harvard community.  Throughout six difficult months of separation and worry, Diane and I received what can only be described as tremendous support.  I received literally hundreds of morale boosting letters while serving in the Persian Gulf area, and the expressions of concern and friendship Diane received made a big difference for her here at home.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE WONDERFUL THING about Desert Storm though, was that Diane and I, as an American soldier and spouse, were not alone in receiving such support.  We, the Allies, had superior technology and firepower in this war.</span></p> <p><span>But it was perhaps more important for all of us to open our mail (when it arrived), talk on the phone, listen to the radio and know that we were thoroughly loved and supported by our families, friends and fellow country people back at home.</span></p> <p><span>Something tells me that songs like \"Voices that Care\" and \"God Bless the USA\" already sound sappy to many people.  Nevertheless, these songs literally made <i>everyone</i> quiet and brought tears of pride and joy to everyone's eyes in the Gulf.  The fact is that we, the soldiers and sailors of Desert Storm, were strong because America was strong.</span></p> <p><span>In addition, I and the 15 or so other ROTC graduates from Harvard who served and fought in the war were strong in part because we received support from the Harvard community.  On a personal level, Diane and I want to thank all of you at Harvard who supported us and helped both of us to be strong too.  Thank you for being part of the effort.</span></p> <p><span>That brings me back to the Kuwaiti man who thanked me so warmly.  Remembering him now, I am not embarrassed; he was not just thanking me, but all of you too.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Kill 'Em All & Let God Sort 'Em Out | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>A</b>S IRAQUIS STRUGGLE to rebuild an economy bombed back to the 11th century, as tens of thousands of Panamanians remain homeless two years after American planes bombed them out, politicians and Pentagon planners have begun considering new ways to drive Saddam Hussein from power, and America has failed to recognize that short video wars kill thousands of people when the bombs are dropping, and thousands more after they stop.</span></p> <p><span>We have yet to come to grips with the fact that these last two good wars, effective as they may have been in imposing American policies, were not clean.  When they happened, these wars killed people in horrible ways.  After they happened, the wreckage of war continued to kill people in horrible ways.  Obsessed with Iraqi atrocities and Manuel Noriega's wickedness, we fired on and forgot the civil societies next to the bunkers.</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>HEN THE GRAND ARMY of the Republic and General Sherman perfected total war on the way to the beach, they executed a fundamental shift in friend-foe relations.  The realization that whole societies and not just armies go to war made societies legitimate targets.  Supply lines, economic resources (crops, farms, mines), communications networks--all of them helped the enemy, and they all needed to be cut off if the war was ever going to end.</span></p> <p><span>World War II consolidated total war theory in the minds of strategists everywhere in the form of strategists bombing.  First used by the Spanish Fascists, by the end of the war it was standard Allied policy.  \"Secondary targets,\" i.e. city populations, were subject to hundreds of sorties a day, and the idea of dropping a megaton of explosives on a city became an achievable goal.  The black skies over Dresden, Hamburg, Cologne and Tokyo--choked with bombladen planes--were mirrored on the ground by raging firestorms that swept through the cities killing up to 100,000 people in a single day.</span></p> <p><span>When the atomic bombs were used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki it was with the firm knowledge that massive destruction--the extermination of society--was a legitimate mode of military action.  With 200,000 dead Japanese in the first week, the bombs brought victory.</span></p> <p><span>But strategic bombing did not stop its progress with World War II.  In fact, it can't.  The amazing thing is that even with a century of total war behind us, we continually have to re-legitimize the decision to kill 'em all and let God sort'em out.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>T USED TO BE that total war was a way of punishing the opposing society for trying to mess with the best or a way of scaring them into surrendering before we killed everyone (which we can do, you know, city by city, town by town, every last fucking one of 'em, if it comes to that).  But in Panama and Iraq, those reasons made no sense.</span></p> <p><span>In Panama, where we supposedly intervening on behalf of a duly elected government, a majority of the people hated the guy we were after, so killing them would be counterproductive.</span></p> <p><span>In Iraq, where a lot of them did support the guy we were after, no amount of civilian death would convince Saddam to surrender--he'd just let 'em all die, and he didn't care about the Young Americans for Freedom pledge to nuke Iraq into the world's largest glass coffee table.  His bunker, after all, had a heated swimming pool.  (Odd that we know all about the swim-up bar in that bunker and we have no idea what Bush's looks like).</span></p> <p><span>Fortunately, high technology came to the aid of those in the Pentagon who still believe that the only surrender comes from a society on its knees and begging for mercy.  All the techno-babble that gushed out of USSOCOM and Riyadh and Washington like oil from a wrecked refinery convinced us that \"support networks\" had to be hit, and that we were hitting them precisely:  power stations, highways, food storage locations, hospitals.</span></p> <p><span>Of course \"support networks\" support civilians as well, and all this high-tech bombing guarantees that not only military leaders but everyone \"collocated\" with them gets blown up, starved out, cut off and killed.  This is the lie of \"collateral damage.\"</span></p> <p><span>When Stealth fighters and B-52s levelled the slum area of El Chorillo in Panama--creating 30,000 instant homeless and uncounted dead--when F-15Es and Tomahawks tore up the suburbs of Baghdad, they got away with it.  We believed that if the military could have, they would have avoided these folks, and that if those folks lived so close to support networks, they obviously supported them.</span></p> <p><span><b>K</b>ILLING IS A QUESTION of proximity.  Before the war started last year, a Kuwaiti girl, identified only by the name Nayirah, testified before the House Human Rights Committee that she had seen Iraqi soldiers rip Kuwaiti babies out of incubators and throw them on the cold floor to die.  It was a horrifying story, and according to <i>60 Minutes,</i> President Bush quoted it at least 10 times as a reason to go to war.</span></p> <p><span>Recent investigation by a number of journalists has revealed that, as far as anyone can determine, the incident never happened.  Nayirah is the daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador and was coached in her story by public relations executives hired by the Kuwaiti government.</span></p> <p><span>Of course, Iraqi atrocities in Kuwait did take place.  But the direct, compelling nature of Nayirah's emotional story has mitigated the atrocities our Army created in Iraq and Panama.  There probably aren't enough incubators in Iraq, and the few they have were without power for weeks.</span></p> <p><span>More than 100,000 Iraqis have died since the war's end, very few at the hands of the Iraqi military.  In Panama, too, we left behind a nation without a functioning economy, with thousands of people in poverty caused by the war.</span></p> <p><span>It is a national blind spot.  When the video bombs destroyed the video bunkers, we couldn't imagine that anyone actually got hurt.  The military discovered the law of video gravity:  Killing at a distance is possible, and is not as serious when it is backed by a more efficient chain of command.</span></p> <p><span>When out troops left Iraq and Panama, so did our cameras.  Our killings were thirdhand, and no Iraqi Nayirahs have yet appeared on CBS to recount the horror we left behind us.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE LOGIC that reinforces the willingness to kill civilians while making war seem more clean and precise has seized hold of American military planning and made a hero of men like the \"level-headed and astute chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,\" Gen. Colin L. Powell.</span></p> <p><span>The laudatory epithets of <i>Army</i> magazine aside, the administration's warriors are not the moral superiors of Sherman and Oppenheimer.  They are the best that the warrior bureaucracy can produce and nothing more.</span></p> <p><span>In practice, this means stupidities and double talk that would choke the honest among us.  They are worth quoting from <i>Army,</i> the official mouthpiece of this crap.  In Panama, they report, many PDF [Panamanian Defense Force] soldiers were \"discarding their uniforms in an attempt to meld into the general population.\"</span></p> <p><span>Imagine, trying to blend in to the general population of your own country.  Well, the U.S. military wasn't going to let them get away, so it detained thousands of Panamanians, many for months, just to see if they were those wily PDF guys.</span></p> <p><span>But at the same time this \"mop-up\" was going on, the U.S. Army was making sure that we knew just how dangerous the supposed general population is.  In Panama City there was \"sporadic sniping, widespread civil looting, and 'dignity battalions' that roamed the unoccupied portions of the city.\"</span></p> <p><span>The sporadic sniping had been the ostensible reason for bombing El Chorillo.  The \"dignity battalions,\" like those tricky now-you-see-them-now-you-don't PDF members, \"continued to pose a threat,\" although to whom or what except the occupiers is unclear.</span></p> <p><span>And the \"civil looting\"?  Surprise.  Three days of riots gutted Panama City's small shops, destroying cockroach capitalism for the forseeable future and turning this stable if corrupt country into a nation quickly on its way to hard-core deprivation.  The U.S. forces did not have orders to intervene to stop the riots, so they let them run their course.</span></p> <p><span>The U.S. forces did apparently have orders to bring an end to the entire society that would have kept such riots from occurring:  stop the police, round up all journalists (except those in USIA), leave enough of the city in ruin to make sure the only people on the commercial streets are looking to do some shopping without credit cards.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>N IRAQ, the situation was different, but guided by the same principles.  As <i>Army</i> put it:</span></p> <p><span>\"With the relentless and continuous use of air power; the all-out armor, airborne and helicopter assault of the 101st Airborne division on 23 February; the clarity of the objective (drive Iraqi forces from Kuwait); the suddenness of the ground attack; the complete absence of compromise with Saddam's increasingly submissive peace proposals leading up to the decision to unleash the ground forces; and with the sweeping flanking movements and attacks through weak points; the President and the Joint Chiefs were clearly committed to the time-honored principles of war:  mass, objective, surprise, maneuver, security, economy of force and simplicity.\"</span></p> <p><span>Simplicity aside, this gargantuan sentence is about as clear as the objective in the Gulf War.  See, they even repeat that objective in case it wasn't clear to you.  How could it be unclear if it was so clear?  Didn't they go to the trouble to print thousands of those little cards that listed, one through four, the reasons we were there?</span></p> <p><span>And, before we forget, there are those \"time-honored principles of war.\"  The key one in the minds of the planners, even if it isn't included in the list, is \"the complete absence of compromise.\"  No retreat, baby, no surrender.</span></p> <p><span><b>P</b>ANAMA AND IRAQ solidified the new total war strategy in the hearts and minds of Americans.  The best example of that solidification is the strange trajectory of the Fuel Air Explosive (FAE) documented by Michael E. Kinsley '72 in <i>The New Republic.</i></span></p> <p><span>FAEs are bombs that are filled with gasoline.  Near the end of their flight, they let out a fine mist of gas behind them, for, say, a mile.  Then, they blow and set all that mist on fire.  The explosive effect is the equivalent of a small nuclear weapon, without the fallout, and the bombs suck all the nearby oxygen out of the air.</span></p> <p><span>It seemed at first that the Iraqis had these things, and were perfectly willing to use them, the bastards.  As The New York Times wrote last January 24, \"Hussein might be planning to use an even more horrific weapon, never before employed in combat, known as the fuel air bomb, which spreads a circle of fire.\"</span></p> <p><span>Well, it eventually came out that the U.S. had some, too, but that the bombs were so powerful, we would only use them if the Iraqis used chemical weapons or FAEs (thus not use them as \"diabolically\" as the Iraqis planned to).</span></p> <p><span>And then finally, it was the U.S. who ended up using all of them.  Part of strategy was to blow up massed Iraqi troops by setting FAEs off over their defensive oil-filled trenches.  Kinsley writes:  \"On February 23, the day the ground war started, <i>The Washington Post</i> reported about this weapon that at first we didn't have, then would never use except against a chemical attack, then were using to clear mine fields and pack down sand:  'All of the front-line Iraqi troops have been subjected to extensive bombardment, including many detonations of BLU-82 bombs, containing fuel-air explosives.'\"  It was firestorms all over again.  \"But by then, who cared?\"</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>O BELIEVE, as many neo-liberals (and General Schwarzkopf) do, that the war in the Gulf was unfortunate, but that once we were in, we should have made sure we fought it to its end, is backwards.  The problem in the Gulf was not that faced with the \"highway of death,\" with the visible artifact of what we destroyed, we failed to finish the job.</span></p> <p><span>\"We\" didn't want to face the destruction at all, true.  But that can lead two ways.  Either it means we stopped short (as <i>Newsweek</i> claims in a recent cover story), or it means that we have to absolutely destroy everything so there is no evidence to see.  Vaporizing bodies, burying them alive, plowing them with steam shovels into mass graves, sweeping them under the carpet bombing--that is the problem.</span></p> <p><span>That problem is what makes Desert Storm and Just Cause strategically similar, even if their (clear?)  objectives are so different.  It is not the case that we no longer fight just wars or that we fight just wars unjustly.  It is that modern wars require us to act unjustly because there is no half way to kill someone.  Our military fights the only way it knows how, and our society thinks like its strategists:  If it offends thee, \"cut it off--then kill it.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>Once again, the U.S. kicks some serious Third World ass.</b></span></p> <p><span><b>Those video bombs didn't really hurt anyone, did they?</b></span></p>"}
{"title": "Symbolic Pump-Priming | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><i>First of a two-part Left Out series reviewing the legacies of America's wars in Panama and Iraq.</i></span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>S GEORGE BUSH ponders new ways to remind Americans of his two favorite wars, as Pentagon hawks try vainly to parley \"successes\" into bigger appropriations for high tech weapons, Saddam Hussein remains in power; Kuwait's democratic elite enslaves Filipino servants; Manuel Noriega gets ready for his acquittal; and America's domestic problems go unchecked, too big, too complicated and too politically explosive for the President who brought us Just Cause and Desert Storm to manage.</span></p> <p><span>Two days after the bombing of the Beirut Marine barracks, we invaded Grenada, a tiny, tiny island whose exact problems and import to the world are still entirely mysterious.  But it was 1983, the economy was recovering, and the fiasco in Lebanon was not that big a problem.  A few thousand American troops, a few casualties, one terrible Clint Eastwood movie.</span></p> <p><span>In 1989, things were looking a little worse.  The economy was slowing down.  Tiananmen made American policy toward China look bad, and events in Eastern Europe (while optimistic) were clearly beyond American control.  So we stepped up the rhetoric.  We picked a dictator with a bad record.  We ignored the fact that we had been supporting him and his drug activities for years.  The Pentagon gave it a catchy name, Operation Just Cause.  (Why do it?  Just 'Cause.) 22,000 soldiers.  Twenty-three die, 330 injured.</span></p> <p><span>In 1990, the economy was clearly going downhill.  The 1992 campaign was within striking range.  Iraq provided a convenient excuse by invading Kuwait, a small, relatively reliable American ally.  Saddam played the awful dictator perfectly.  Again we ignored the fact we had supported him for years.  Bombs away! 650,000 troops, fewer than 100 deaths.  Songs, television specials and incredibly cool images of Tomahawks entering bunkers.</span></p> <p><span>In some twisted way, the wars were a way to prove that presidents could do anything, absolutely anything, for years, and then reverse themselves and send people off to kill and die for the new cause.  Back Saddam for years against the Ayatollah and the Russians, back Noriega for years against the Russians, the Nicaraguans, the Cubans, (the Salvadorans, the Hondurans, the Costa Ricans--he'd do anything).  Do it out in the open and then, when it comes time, go get 'em.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>T A BRIEF, strange moment last year, America flashed back to 1983.  For a few days in winter, Chrysler returned to its early 1980s advertising campaign:  While a LeBaron scooted along a golden desert highway, Kenny Rogers belted out, \"The pride is back, born in America...\"</span></p> <p><span>Forget for a moment that the American car industry is approaching collapse, or that the quality of Chrysler's cars suggest that proud is the one of the least accurate adjectives to describe the company.  The reappearance of this ad was just a tiny patriotic drop in the sea of flag-waving pride that engulfed America during the Iraq war.</span></p> <p><span>This outpouring of American pride--pride in our technological superiority (Rah Patriot Missile), in our brilliant military (Rah 100-hour war), in our humanity (Rah No Civilian Targets), in our racial equity (Rah Colin Powell, Rah Blacks and whites in the trenches), in our democratic ideals (Rah Restoring the Elected and Legitimate Government of the Freedom-Loving People of Kuwait)--has been a successful diversion of our attention from pressing economic issues.</span></p> <p><span>It is \"Symbolic Military Keynesianism\" at its best.  In traditional Keynesian economics--long the bane of Republicans--the federal government \"primes the pump\" of the domestic economy by increasing spending on unemployment benefits, jobs programs and the like.  In military Keynesianism, the government primes the pump by building a massive military program--trading the efficiency of jobs programs for the enticement of military might.</span></p> <p><span>Symbolic Military Keynesianism (SMK) is a substitute for both of these:  Instead of priming the national economy, they prime the national symbolic economy.  By turning inchoate regional barbarities into questions about the fabric of world democracy, our government created a feverish excitement about Panama and Iraq.</span></p> <p><span>Pitched at this intense level--month after month of build-up, day after day of bombing, constant--but censored--television coverage, Bush <i>et al</i> distracted everyone from anything else by glutting the airwaves with Gulf \"news.\"</span></p> <p><span>For months, the Gulf War drove every other issue--the banking disaster, the Liberian massacres, the growing deficit, higher unemployment, the growing trade gap, and the legacy of the previous year's war in Panama--from newspapers and television broadcasts, from the national conversation.  It was a dreamlike state of video war and triumph and it was a shame it ever had to end.</span></p> <p><span>Whining Democratic senators who said we had \"smart bombs but stupid children\" sounded more like upset youngsters who got too small a piece of cake at the big party than outraged politicians.  Sure, you could agree to disagree, but you couldn't disagree and make any difference.</span></p> <p><span><b>B</b>EYOND INDUCING AMNESIA, priming the symbolic pump had marvelous, if temporary, effects on how Americans saw themselves.  Our technology suddenly became the best:  Our smart bombs, our cruise missiles, our infrared goggles, our Patriot missiles (no Sonys here, pal) not only vanquished the primitive weapons of the Iraqis, they vanquished them humanely.  Their Scud missiles hit Tel Aviv houses; our cruise missiles hit chemical weapons storage facilities.</span></p> <p><span>Our military genius, our native American intelligence, proved itself again.  One hundred hours and we beat those tricky camel jockeys to a pulp.  And what was our military strategy based on?  Football.  Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf and his staff devised the plan, and called it a \"Hail Mary,\" sending our troops around the western edge of the Iraqi emplacements and sneaking up on them from the back.  The more appropriate football term would have been \"end run,\" but American coaching got it right anyway.</span></p> <p><span>We transcended our race problems.  Twenty percent of American troops in the Gulf were Black.  Colin Powell, Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is Black.  As the now-popular slogan has it, in the trenches, there is no Black and white.</span></p> <p><span>We transcended Vietnam.  In an \"Army\" magazine article summarizing the war, Vietnam appears as a constant shadow:  \"The conduct of this war was a far cry from Vietnam.\"  George Bush made it as explicit as possible:  Unlike Vietnam, he said, American troops in Iraq would not fight \"with one arm tied behind their backs.\"  As if that were the problem in Vietnam.</span></p> <p><span>And, most important, our American values proved themselves as resilient as they ever were.  The \"diabolical\" Saddam Hussein, as nasty as he wanted to be, attempted to conquer his tiny neighbor.  But the world, convinced of the injustice of dictatorial, militaristic oppression, stood firm, inspired by the quick-thinking, quick-acting United States of America.  While the Japanese and the Germans dickered over whether to help out, we jumped in to defend justice, freedom and democracy.</span></p> <p><span><b>U</b>NFORTUNATELY, symbolic pumppriming has shot its wad.  Not only have our brief transcendental moments of pride vanished, but even the problems we thought we solved, or avoided, continue to haunt us.</span></p> <p><span>American military technology (Patriot missile aside) does work adequately.  But the rest of our technology sure doesn't.  General Motors is firing 70,000 workers.  Most of our advanced industries are barely alive, and last year, for the first time, we ran a deficit in computer equipment.</span></p> <p><span>Our military intelligence also works adequately; we did win the war.  The rest of American planning is less successful, and our native American intelligence is not performing.  We have no adequate long-term solutions for our economic stagnation, our health care crisis, and even for our forgotten \"war,\" the War on Drugs.</span></p> <p><span>The idea that we transcended our racial problems in the trenches is an attractive one, but it has little connection to the economic and social barriers that continue to aggravate racial tensions in civilian society.</span></p> <p><span>And our feverish rhetoric about democratic values has not been notably effective in practice.  Not only are many Americans disgusted with their own politics, but Kuwait, which continues to oppress Palestinians and its other foreign workers, has made hardly a move toward actual democracy.  Saddam Hussein remains in power.  Hafez Assad of Syria is prospering.  The Kurds are still dying, at the hands of Iraq and of our ally Turkey.</span></p> <p><span>In Panama, the promised elections have still not been held, and when they are, the aristocrats led by Endara are sure to win.  Noriega's political machine still exists, under new management, and with the same constituency, a constituency that doesn't want its leaders, but is nationalist enough to want to die rather than live under continued American occupation.  Drug money still pours through the banks and keeps the place running on a shoestring.  If not to prevent violence and totalitarianism, what were these wars for?</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE ANSWER, of course, continues to be money.</span></p> <p><span>Kuwait's economy is up and rolling again, with thousands of new jobs for unemployed Egyptians and East Asians.  Iraq, too, is rejoining the world economy, under UN-encouraged imperialist terms.  Israel is getting more American aid for its cooperation.  Panama continues to be a safe money haven and the canal continues to be ours.  And the other banana republics still send us all the bananas we want.</span></p> <p><span>So while our military adventures prime the symbolic pump at home, they prime the economic pump abroad, allowing capitalism to continue to reign and the oil to flow freely.  At home, of course, Americans see very little economic benefit from the war, but we were feeling so damn proud of our boys and girls over there that all that money stuff did not even matter.</span></p> <p><span>The pride in the fighters who were born in America realized itself in an explosion of hoopla and marketing.  Every city had a parade, whether it was for Appalachicola's own 69th Reserve Quartermaster unit or D.C.'s national orgasm of delight--a parade that left tons of garbage in the city, torn-up streets as far as the eye could see, and slightly improved receipts at the local bar as everyone set one up for the boys.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE PROBLEM NOW is that there are no more adequate targets for Team USA to fire on and forget.  Symbolic pump-priming requires ever larger, ever more evil, targets.  It was no accident that every war we have fought since Vietnam has been \"the largest mobilization of U.S. troops since Vietnam.\"  Americans are finally angry enough about domestic issues that another Panama won't do much more than raise a few pulses for a day.</span></p> <p><span>SMK, like Keynesian economics, raises the aggregate demand.  It's a dependence effect, an addiction where you need to try harder just to forget how bad things are.  Very few of us would stand for just another Panama or just another Iraq without squealing a great deal.  And very few of us would mess with the really big bad armies and navies that haven't yet come in from the Cold War.</span></p> <p><span>Economic Keynesianism, at worst, leaves you with some nice government-built bridges.  Symbolic Military Keynesianism leaves you with a vague sense of disappointment and massive hangover of drugs, crime, unemployment, a third-rate video duplicate of Whitney Huston \"celebrating America's proudest moment\" on HBO and a total absence of concern for the wreckage the military left behind.</span></p>"}
{"title": "HARVARD'S REPUBLICAN PIT BULL | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>On a predominantly liberal campus like Harvard, an unabashed conservative like Sumner E. Anderson '92 can create a sensation.</span></p> <p><span>And after a few months heading the Harvard Republican Club (HRC) two years ago, Anderson did just that. Setting an extreme right-wing agenda for the club, Anderson made moves that alienated many moderate campus Republicans and angered many gays and lesbians.</span></p> <p><span>Despite the HRC's more moderate position these days, Anderson is still an active ideologue, concerned with the same controversial issues that made headlines less than two years ago.</span></p> <p><span><b>THEN</b> Anderson won the presidency of the Republican Club in an election that was nothing if not controversial.</span></p> <p><span>Of the 20 to 25 voters present, Anderson had personally invited 15 of them.</span></p> <p><span>Anderson denied wrongdoing, saying \"If I hadn't brought those people in, there would not have been anyone there.</span></p> <p><span>\"I'm under the impression that in any election you should know even before you enter the room that you're going to win,\" he said at the time.</span></p> <p><span>Raised in a devoutly religious family, he frames his beliefs in terms of absolute Christian morality.</span></p> <p><span>One well-known example is Anderson's disgust for homosexuality, which he has called \"deviant behavior\" in several letters to The Crimson.</span></p> <p><span>\"It's repulsive,\" Anderson wrote once. \"It's a disease...it's totally abnormal. It's not a natural activity.\"</span></p> <p><span>Republicans who left the club soon after Anderson took office described his right-wing ideological stance as exclusionary and, in one case, \"fascist.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"The [executive] board's tactics are reminiscent of the Stalinist purges of the 1930's,\" Jeremy Sevareid '92, then program director of the club, wrote to The Crimson in May, 1991. \"Their actions have...splintered Republicans on campus.\"</span></p> <p><span>But Anderson asserts that his conservatism reflected the National GOP platform and the American mainstream.</span></p> <p><span>\"During my time as head of HRC, conservatism on campus had a resurgence,\" he says, citing the publication of <i>Peninsula</i> and the formation of AALARM (the Association Against Learning in the Absence of Religion and Morality).</span></p> <p><span>Campus Democrats, meanwhile said that a turn to the right for the HRC could only boost support for their party.</span></p> <p><span>Anderson, meanwhile, responded with a devil-may-care attitude: \"If the administration doesn't like us, if gay groups don't like us, tough luck.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>NOW</b> While Anderson's immediate plans these days are to finish his thesis on wealth and to equality in Jamaica and work towards a post-graduation career in the Navy, he has not abandoned his politics.</span></p> <p><span>His position on homosexuality was clearer than ever after The Rev. Peter J. Gomes, who is minister of Memorial Church, identified himself as gay at a public event in November.</span></p> <p><span>\"I was utterly shocked,\" Anderson says. \"He's a brilliant speaker and a personable man, but when it comes to central issues of faith, you can't ignore his blatant disregard for Christian teaching.\"</span></p> <p><span>Anderson strongly condemns Gomes and has repeatedly urged that he resign as minister \"unless he professes homosexuality to be a sin within the Christian religion.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"It's not the fact that he's a homosexual...it's that he won't admit that homosexuality is sinful,\" Anderson says.</span></p> <p><span>Anderson says he attended Memorial Church for three years before discovering that Gomes was gay.</span></p> <p><span>Anderson has not toned down his views in the last several years, although his current presidency of the campus Conservative Club places him in a lower profile position than he had two years ago.</span></p> <p><span>\"The Conservative Club is a much more intellectually-based group,\" Anderson says, adding that members spend a great deal of time discussing political doctrines.</span></p> <p><span>If you don't understand the underpinnings of your arguments,\" he says, \"you won't be able to espouse them as effectively.\"</span></p> <p><span>This semester, the Conservative Club will send members to New Hampshire campaigning for Republican Presidential Candidate Pat Buchanan and President Bush.</span></p> <p><span>In addition, Anderson says that a coalition of campus conservatives will launch full-scale campaign against Gomes.</span></p> <p><span>Like the writers of <i>Peninsula,</i> Anderson continues to emphasize Harvard's origins as a Christian university.</span></p> <p><span>\"Harvard is a landmark for Christians in this country. When they hear the minister is gay, they're disillusioned.\"</span></p> <p><span>And though he is criticized for his views, he maintains--as he always has--that he is in line with the bulk of American conservatives.</span></p> <p><span>\"All I've ever tried to do,\" he says, \"is espouse mainstream, conservative values that I feel are essential for America's growth and prosperity.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "Shopping Blues | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>Y</b>OU THOUGHT YOU were safe. Education is supposed to be one of those recession-proof industries like McDonald's and Hallmark Cards. You could never imagine one of them closing their doors. When things get really bad, that's when you need to drown your sorrows in a 49 cent burger and read a Shoebox Greeting from somebody who loves you--like your Mom, perhaps, who won't bug you about not being able to find a job or a summer internship.</span></p> <p><span>Your four years of college aren't really preparation for the real world, she will attest. This is just an academic experience for the sake of an academic experience--pursuing knowledge for its own sake.</span></p> <p><span>Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>HAVE SOME bad news for everyone trying to ride out the recession in Harvard's bastion of esoteric wisdom. The recession has hit Harvard, and at no time has it been more telling than during this Shopping Week.</span></p> <p><span>We already know what cutbacks are like. We should have been forewarned at Reading Period. General Motors had to lay off 74,000 workers, but we lost a whole week. When they cut our schedule down to a measly five days, it was our sign that hard times have hit University Hall.</span></p> <p><span>Who is at fault? Reagan, the Japanese, Saddam Hussein, Derek Bok? I'd say it was mostly MTV and CNN. MTV fostered our evil video generation, while CNN taught us that watching TV is sometimes more beneficial than going to class.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard hasn't done much to inspire its students in this year of dire economic news. For a depressing view of the world, just look at the recruiting schedule for speakers at the Kennedy School. It reads like the sale chart at Filene's Basement--discount professors 50 percent off, former world leaders, an additional $10 off the red line price. Former presidential candidates get a free pair of socks.</span></p> <p><span>So far, the Kennedy School, like half of the academic institutions in America, has offered an invitation to Mikhail S. Gorbachev--you know, the former leader of the former Soviet Union. If I were Gorbachev, I'd take my forty-dollar-a-month pension, settle into my little dacha in the Crimea and play with my grand-daughter. I wouldn't want to brave the Boston winter to explain to 24-year-old gov jocks how I failed as the leader of the world's other \"superpower.\" Even Freud wouldn't recommend that much self-awareness.</span></p> <p><span>Buddy Roemer, who lost the governor's race in Louisiana, but who isn't David Duke, recently accepted his invitation to be a fellow at the Kennedy School. The Institute of Politics only offered a speaking engagement to Duke. The former white hooder will get a nice honorarium for his repugnant propaganda, but no steady paycheck.</span></p> <p><span>In the past, the Kennedy School has hosted such faded luminaries as Michael S. Dukakis and Henry Kissinger, who spent a memorable week last year doing the weather on one of those morning news shows. Who is next for a fellowship offer, John Sununu? Will he be teaching economics or public relations? Or, perhaps, ethics?</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>LONG WITH the dreadful news from the teaching arena, the other effect of the recession on Shopping Period is the intense increase in competition. We get a taste of the overcrowded job market every time we try to get into a class.</span></p> <p><span>As many people tried to jam into Literature and Arts B-39 \"Michaelangelo\" as crowded into the Science Center to see Dr. Ruth. We must have some kind of fetish for the discussion of naked bodies. Spike Lee had to move his first lecture yesterday to Sanders Theater, but that's fine since none of the people there will actually get into the class.</span></p> <p><span>There is not much the University can do about overcrowded classes. In the long run, the reduction in necessary classroom space and professors will cut costs. The body heat generated by stuffing 1400 people into a room for 400 will save in energy costs and help the environment. And, with more students per class, there will be more sections (since the University has started enforcing the students per section rules).</span></p> <p><span>That means more graduate students with stipends can survive the harsh winter. They will not, however, have many classes to teach once they finish their dissertations. But that's fine also, since whatever they write can be dutifully recycled in this environmentally aware society.</span></p> <p><span>President Bush said in a recent campaign speech that the economy is in free fall. The state of Harvard is slightly better. We are pretty well-insulated as long as we take courses that no one has ever mentioned before. The best suggestion I can make is that students invest some of their time in the Harvard Bartending Course. It is the only career training that might mean anything once we graduate.</span></p> <p><span>At least then we'll be able to drown our sorrows in some nicely mixed drinks.</span></p> <p><span><i>Beth L. Pinsker '93, editorial chair of The Crimson, wishes she had just napped through Shopping Period</i></span></p>"}
{"title": "What Are You Waiting For? | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>S</b>TICKING TO NEW YEAR'S resolutions is no piece of cake. Before the Big Apple is even comfortably perched atop Times Square, criminals who had repented just moments earlier already begin snagging wallets, George Bush's lips go in reverse as taxes are raised and Oprah's stomach suddenly can't survive on liquids alone.</span></p> <p><span>But even if keeping one's word for a year isn't so easy, staying honest for one semester doesn't seem as daunting. The spring term is thankfully a truncated version of its fall counterpart. It's only three more shopping days and twelve more weeks to the next encounter with reading period. So now is the time to take the plunge and uphold a promise for at least this short segment of the academic year.</span></p> <p><span>Before the hustle and bustle of unit tests, labs, mid-terms and (yes, Dean Dingman, it's true) overcrowded dorm rooms get you down again, stop and think of a way to inject a bit more meaning into this semester's schedule: volunteer, take a break, close the books for even a brief encounter with the real world. Whether it's social action or political activism, do what you can to make a difference beyond the Ivory Tower.</span></p> <p><span><b>C</b>OLLEGE STUDENTS ARE perfectly suited for such extracurricular pursuits. For most, these unique four years mark perhaps the last time that the demands of profession, self-sufficiency and family do not pull at the seams of busy schedules. After graduation, only the most idealistic will sacrifice time and energy in search of truth and justice.</span></p> <p><span>College campus contains the components necessary to produce effective social and political activism--student groups. And we have a ton of them. Phillips Brooks House Association (PBHA), the House and Neighborhood Development program (HAND), Citystep, the Harvard Democrats and Republicans, Harvard for Harkin, Students for Clinton, Students for Kerrey, even Students for Agran. You get the picture.</span></p> <p><span>All these organizations (and more) are salivating to involve new members in planning and programming. They have attracted many students with an array of diverse interests and talents. It's an environment few will find again outside the Yard's gates.</span></p> <p><span>Working together to produce change for the better should not be passed up just because a problem set is due at five.</span></p> <p><span>A good deal of students already subscribe to such a philosophy. Some of them are in PBHA, Harvard's largest student-run group (apparently 1500 members strong). The organization has 41 committees and 75 programs, ranging from recycling initiatives on campus to tutoring kids in the inner city. PBHA tries to offer something for everyone.</span></p> <p><span>Perception has it that getting involved with PBHA is like signing over the semester's grades to the gutter. But not all commitments mean intense chunks of time. Certainly longterm involvement goes furthest in aiding the disadvantaged, but a semester-long social service stint is good for starters.</span></p> <p><span>One's motives don't need to be stellar, either. Whether driven by dreams of intense resume-padding, the chance to test teaching skills on unsuspecting fourth graders or simply the rare opportunity to help those less fortunate, PBHA will gladly accept your contribution. Helping others doesn't mean giving up other pursuits, activities or studies. Just move them over and find out what PBHA has to offer.</span></p> <p><span><b>N</b>OT ALL STUDENTS ARE attracted to the social responsibility required by community service. Maybe you don't want to spend nights in homeless shelters. That's fine. But that doesn't give you an excuse for ducking out of at least a semester-long commitment to helping someone just because you're going ballistic about your GPA or your position on, say, The Crimson. So what can those non-community service oriented students do to help people? Political activism.</span></p> <p><span>How about getting involved with the Republican or Democrat Clubs or the various presidential candidate support groups that have sprung up? Now is the perfect time.</span></p> <p><span>The current recession has quickly become one of the campaign's major issues. Since real-life job searches are in store for all in the not-so-distant future, the state of the economy is bearing heavily in college students' minds. Demanding steps to address the nation's recession-plagued social and economic woes through political activism fits into the realm of not just seeking help for yourself but for others as well. It's that whole enlightened self-interest thing.</span></p> <p><span>The goals of political action differ only slightly from those of social service. This election season's campaign for the middle class seems to have left out the most needy. Aside from suggestions such as those from Republican Patrick J. Buchanan to sweep streets clean of the homeless and lock them up in jails across the country, little mention is made of the very poor and hopeless.</span></p> <p><span>Few seem willing to take up their cause. Student involvement in the race for the White House can shift debate back to the issues of greatest concern to those most in need of assistance--even though that shift might be spurred by our own selfish fears.</span></p> <p><span>Still, perhaps it is unrealistic to expect active student involvement in the 1992 presidential campaign. For some, the ease with which a spring semester vow can be broken is too tempting to be passed up. But, with nations across the globe waging battle for the right to representative government, it is nothing less than criminal to neglect your ability to help choose the next leader of this country.</span></p> <p><span>With that in mind, the most significant extracurricular step to take this month would be registering to vote in the Massachusetts presidential primary (assuming you're not registered at home). Those not yet on the rolls have until February 11 to add their names to the election list (or change party preference, as this writer plans to do).</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>HETHER ONE CHOOSES the path of social or political action, the new tradition of student apathy at Harvard must be broken. The notion that issues worthy of student protest went out with the '60s and '70s is completely misconceived.</span></p> <p><span>When consumer advocate-cum-presidential candidate Ralph Nader spoke at the Kennedy School two weeks ago, he advised students to question campus administrators and their agendas. Undergraduates should demand the disclosure of Harvard's corporate contacts, Nader said. The president of the University should be required to deliver a state of the school address. The seven most powerful figures at Harvard's helm--the members of the Corporation--should be forced to meet with students. Maybe he's right.</span></p> <p><span>Whatever the case, whether one agrees with Nader's suggestions or not, there is clearly a large silence waiting to be broken by the voices of student protest and a void ready to be filled with the activism of social and political groups.</span></p> <p><span>For example, groups have already begun meeting to plan a joint protest in expectation of a possible Harvard address by former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. Such efforts of student mobilization merit praise. Other students should leave their carrels in Lamont to combat the politics of hate in this election season.</span></p> <p><span>In any case, students may prove to be key in this country's attempts to solve social and political ills. Two candidates for the Democratic nomination, Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa and Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, have caught on to this approach and advocate a program whereby the government would provide high school graduates with college tuition money in return for a commitment of community service.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>N HIS FAMOUS \"I have a dream\" speech, Martin Luther King Jr., who was commemorated yesterday in a Memorial Church service, said \"now is the time\" for true social change in the United States. That was over 18 years ago.</span></p> <p><span>Today, such words still ring true. This semester is the time to put down the books for just a few minutes each week to get involved in social action groups or political organizations. Because now really is the time. As Ralph Nader said, \"If you don't desire to shape the University, when it's at your disposal, it is doubtful you have prepared your-self for the democratic world of the future in which you'll play a part.\" He was pontificating, to be sure. But he was right.</span></p> <p><span>So if your New Year's Resolution was too hard for you to keep, make a New Term Resolution to make a difference instead. Unlike so many others, this commitment goes beyond yourself and affects the lives of others. Now is the time to keep a promise so often broken.</span></p> <p><span>College students can be the ones to make a difference for many in this country who are struggling. Call me naive. Call me overly-idealistic. But call that struggle real life for many Americans.</span></p>"}
