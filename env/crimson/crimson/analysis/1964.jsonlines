The arrests were made by Federal, state, and local authorities.</span></p> <p><span>McComb police chief George Guy said last night, \"We know these three men did two of the bombings and I think maybe more....  But I don't think they're guilty of all of them.\"</span></p> <p><span>There is a definite possibility that others may be arrested soon, Guy said.</span></p> <p><span>Sheriff R.R. Warren of Pike County explained that one of the arrested men, Paul Wilson, \"finally broke down and told us a little bit of what had happened.  He implicated the other two.\"</span></p> <p><span>J.D. Smith, McComb voter registration worker, said that the arrest had envoked \"rampant enthusiasm from the Negro community.\"</span></p> <p><span>But Smith felt that the arrests were no cause for optimism.  \"I think the physical danger remains basically the same,\" he said.  \"We'll wait to see what indictments are returned against these men.\"</span></p> <p><span>The thre arrests may bring some relaxation of the tense situation in this southwest Mississippi town.  Since Aug. 28, 11 bombings have damaged homes and churches belonging to Negroes active in the local voter registration drive.</span></p> <p><span>Three week ago, McComb COFO director Jesse Harris wrote a detailed letter to Burke Marshall, Assistant Attorney General for civil rights.</span></p> <p><span>Harris's letter read in part, \"The situation which is developing in Pike County resembles that which...culminated in the murders of three civil rights workers in Philadelphia...We plead with you to take action...\"</span></p> <p><span>Last week four bombings, the arrest of over 50 local Negroes, and a massive influx of state police brought tensions to a peak.  Sixteen local Negroes are still in jail under charges of criminal syndicalism.</span></p> <p><span>Shortly afterwards, President Johnson met with Mrs. Willie Dillon, Mrs. Aleyne Quinn, and Mrs. Charles C. Bryant of McComb.  The homes of all three have been recently bombed.</span></p> <p><span>Three days ago members of the white community voiced their fears.  A large ad in McComb's weekly newspaper began, \"We are no longer dealing with the question of segregation.  We are faced with the possibility that the life of this community is at stake.\"</span></p> <p><span>The ad went on to offer a $5000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the bombers.  Signers of the ad included the McComb Chamber of Commerce, the Lions Club, the Rotary Club, and the Jaycee's.</span></p> <p><span>Pike County has been a center of racist violence for the past few years.  Both the Ku Klux Klan and the Americans for the Preservation for the White Race have been widely organized in that area.</span></p> <p><span>At least one of the arrested men, Paul Wilson, possessed membership cards in both of these organizations.  In Wilson's home officials also found four rifles, a pistol, thousands of rounds of ammunition, eight clubs, a blackjack, brass knuckles, a deputy sheriff's badge, and a black leatherette hood</span></p>"}

Police approached one of the leaders, Jack Weinberg, and asked for his ID card.  When he refused, saying it would lead to his suspension, the officers placed him under arrest.  Weinberg went limp, and when the university police carried him to a waiting patrol car, hundreds of students sat down on all sides of the vehicle, and prevented it from moving.</span></p> <p><span>The police insisted that Weinberg was under arrest, and said they intended to wait until the mob moved.</span></p> <p><span>But instead of moving, the crowd of students swelled to 2500.

{"title": "The Conservatives In Wisconsin:  Dedication Not To Be Dismissed | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>\"Conservatism is at a crossroads.\"  So goes the common thinking.  If the Goldwater-Miller ticket is defeated, as appears likely, then, it is reasoned, \"conservatism\" will sink into political oblivion.  Having been given the \"choice\" they so long clamored for and having had their choice soundly rejected, the conservatives will quietly disappear from sight.</span></p> <p><span>This thesis is nothing more than wishful thinking.</span></p> <p><span>It ignores a fundamental reality of the conservative strength in America.  Barry Goldwater is not a cause; he is a result--a result of staunchly dedicated, hard-working, sincere proponents of conservatism at the grass roots level.  These people, a minority, imposed their candidate and their views on one of the two major political parties.  A Goldwater defeat--even a large one--will disappoint but not deter them.  Whatever the outcome in November, the people who have toiled diligently for the conservative cause are determined not to let it die.</span></p> <p><span>A look at conservative strength where it really exists--in pockets at the local level all over the nation--confirms its durability.  Wisconsin, the home of the late Senator McCarthy and still one of the bastions of conservatism, serves as a case in point.</span></p> <p><span>Just outside of the state's largest city, Milwaukee, there is an unusual bookstore.  The people who work there take no wages; they receive no profit.</span></p> <p><span>The front walls of the small shop--called the Book Pedlar--are lined with inexpensive booklets and pamphlets.  The titles are blunt:  \"Communism and the Negro Revolution\" (44 pages, published by the \"Patrick Henry Group\"); \"The Socialistic Views of Nelson Rockefeller\" (published by the Independent American, \"a national Conservative newspaper, which is dedicated to the restoration of Constitutional Government\"); and \"The Time Has Come, An Up-to-date Report to Those Who Know the Score\" (by Robert Welch, founder of the John Birch Society).</span></p> <p><span>No desire for monetary gain, but rather a <i>sincere</i> desire to save her country, motivated a local housewife to open the Book Pedlar.  <i>\"AMERICANISM and our Christian heritage is [sic] the sheme and story of the Book Pedlar,\"</i> she says in a small printed note of explanation.  <i>\"Today, with the realization that we are living in an age when the world stands at a great spiritual crossroad--there is a definite need to distinguish truth from error.  Militant atheism is waging a concerted battle for the control of the minds of men...and Americans are challenged to meet this threat.  In addition, socialistic and tolitaritan</i> [sic] <i>forms of government threaten to dilute our American principle of 'government by law.'\"</i></span></p> <p><span>The political right is deeply entrenched in Wisconsin.  It controls the state Republican party.  A few days before the San Francisco Convention, the state GOP chairman declared that if Goldwater were not nominated, his organization would in effect ignore the national ticket.  Support of the conservative cause, however, extends beyond the GOP.  The John Birch Society, the Christian Anti-Communist Crusade and many local groups have faithful followings.</span></p> <p><span>Although still in the thick of the presidential campaign, staunch conservatives are not ignoring the prospect of a Goldwater defeat.  If Goldwater loses, \"the hard core will remain,\" comments Edward Friend, a prominent Milwaukee conservative and former chairman of Wisconsin's fifth Congressional district.  \"They're doing it because they have convictions--they're dedicated, motivated...They would rather die than surrender what they honestly believe in their hearts.\"</span></p> <p><span>William Grede, a local industrialist who helped found the John Birch Society and now serves on its national council, throws a slightly different light on the Johnson-Goldwater race:  \"Win or lose, this debate between conservatism and liberalism will help conservatives...This is the first breakthrough the conservatives have had.\"  He emphasizes that regardless of the outcome in November, the Birch Society \"must\" continue.</span></p> <p><span>This view--that the Goldwater candidacy, even in defeat, marks a significant beginning for the growth of the conservative movement in America--is held by many others.  Even if wrong, it tends to encourage, not discourage, a continued tireless devotion to the conservative cause.  For just as civil rights has stirred the passions and gained the undivided dedication of a small minority of people, conservatism, on the other end of the political bench, has done the same.</span></p> <p><span>The commitment to conservatism is seen in two women.  They are chatting in the corner of the Book Pedlar.  One asks about the League of Women Voters.  \"They're the most liberal group in town,\" answers the other; \"don't even try to infiltrate them.\"</span></p> <p><span>To many, the mere mention of \"infiltration\" suggests treachery.  Perhaps they are right, but to the two women, any act of \"infiltration\" is better classified as an act of \"salvation\"--salvation of the United States, a Republic, a country of individuals, a country free from the encroachments of big government.</span></p> <p><span>Passionate dedication to the conservative cause takes many forms. Founding the Book Pedlar is one answer.  Joining the Birch Society or smaller \"study groups\" is another.  Active participation in politics is yet a third.</span></p> <p><span>Whatever the precise form, the commitment does exist.  One prominent Milwaukee conservative points out the dedication of a local study group:  \"There are a number of ladies in my neighborhood who simply meet at each other's houses every now and then and ... discuss issues.  Most of them are extremely intelligent women, and they do a lot of reading.  They establish files into which they put articles and clippings which appeal to them.\"</span></p> <p><span>This man himself has three filing cabinets of carefully catalogued clippings and pamphlets on communism.</span></p> <p><span>When conservatives and ultra-conservatives turn to politics, they do so with determination.  In Wisconsin, they tightly control the local Republican apparatus in many areas.  Just last spring a Republican caucus in one of Wisconsin's ten Congressional districts passed resolutions which opposed the graduated income tax, called for the defeat of the civil rights bill, and asked for a full-scale investigation of the State Department\" in the best McCarthy tradition.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>'Kookie' Young Reps</i></b></span></p> <p><span>A prominent \"moderate\" Milwaukee Republican declares that two of the metropolitan area's Republican clubs (including the state's largest, with more than 5000 members) are controlled by Birch elements or Birch sympathizers.  He says that the state's \"radical right\" is well financed, and then ticks off a number of important industrialists who give their full support to the movement.  In addition, he claims that \"the party is dependent on these people for big contributions.\"</span></p> <p><span>Conservatives and ultra-conservatives have also been at work among the youth of the party.  \"Young Republican Clubs around here are full of 'kooks,'\" this moderate Republican explains.  The conservatives, he elaborates, \"are the people who actually run these groups.\"</span></p> <p><span>Thus, for years, conservatives have been laboring doggedly in areas like Wisconsin.  As more than a partial result of their efforts, Barry Goldwater is the Republican presidential nominee.  The moderates should have learned one thing in San Francisco:  the conservatives deeply believe in the rightcousness of their cause; their toil is not solely an attempt to gain power, and, once they have attained power at any level, they will not easily modify the views that prompted them to action in the first place.</span></p> <p><span>The conservative is where he is today--not only in certain segments of the Republican party, but also in parts of the Democratic party--because he works hard.  Those who dislike the conservative and his credo must work even harder if they are to demolish his power</span></p>"}

{"title": "Politics in Michigan | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Goldwater strategists see the Midwest as the crucial battleground in this fall's election, but one Midwestern state no one expects the Senator to carry is Michigan.  There is usually a Democratic majority there and considerable evidence of strong frontlash this year, especially n the suburbs outside Detroit.  White backlash is apparently not as strong in Michigan as in some large industrial states; in a key primary, seven-term Congressman John Lesinski, the only northern Democrat to vote against the civil rights bill, was beaten by his more liberal colleague John Dingell.  Lesinski's defeat shows that hard work, particularly on the part of labor unions like the giant U.A.W.  Local 600, can overcome backlash sentiment even where civil rights is the only issue between candidates.</span></p> <p><span>The race issue will play little part in the state's bitterly contested gubernatorial race, however, for both Republican incumbent George Romney and Democratic congressman-at-large Neil Staebler are strong supporters of civil rights.  Other issues have dominated the campaign.  Romney claims credit for solving Michigan's financial problems, while Staebler points out that the Kennedy-Johnson Administration, not the Governor, is largely responsible for the prosperity Michigan is enjoying.</span></p> <p><span>Debate on this issue is crucial, because Romney's list of accomplishments is astonishingly small.  Romney could persuade the heavily Republican legislature to fulfill few of the campaign promises made in 1962.  Romney was even less successful than his Democratic predecessor in his efforts to enact a badly needed tax reform.  governor John Swainson's bill made it to the floor of the State Senate and almost passed, while Romney's bill died in committee.</span></p> <p><span>Despite his national prominence, Romney has not proved to be much of a vote getter in Michigan.  In 1962, he won the governorship by 80,000 votes--a margin much smaller than those enjoyed by other Republicans like William Scranton and Nelson Rockefeller or even James Rhodes of Ohio.  In a 1963 referendum on a new state constitution--a major issue between Romney and his Democratic opponents--Romney's side won by only 7,000 votes.  Last June Romney showed no particular strength in the usually accurate Detroit News poll; he led Staebler by a surprisingly small 50-45 margin.</span></p> <p><span>Presidential politics has inevitably entered the state campaign.  Staebler misses no chance to endorse Lyndon Johnson; while Romney has maintained a more equivocal--and often meandering--attitude toward his party Presidential nominee.  Last May, before the California primary, Romney promised to have nothing to do with a \"stop-anyone movement\"; within two weeks, he was breaking his well-publicized ban on Sunday politicking to stir up just such a movement.  It seems that the Governor had just seen some polls giving President Johnson 70 per cent of Michigan's vote against Goldwater in Michigan.</span></p> <p><span>Apparently Johnson's lead has not slipped much since June, for Romney is still clinging to a charmingly ambiguous position he formulated after the Republican convention: he \"supports\" (but does not \"endorse\") the Republican ticket \"from top to bottom.\"  He never, however, mentions the word \"Goldwater\" in public, nor will he say who will receive his vote for the Presidency of the United States.  He undoubtedly expects Johnson to win, and he is concerned, as he is fond of saying, with state problems--especially that of getting himself re-elected.</span></p> <p><span>Overshadowing the gubernatorial race is the huge majority that President Johnson is expected to win.  If Johnson wins, for instance, 62 per cent of the vote, his margin will be something like 750,000 votes in the state, and the rest of the Democratic ticket, headed by Senator Philip Hart, is expected most voters will pull the straight party lever.  An unprecendencd number of Michigan voters will have to take the trouble to split their tickets if George Romney is to be re-elected Governor.</span></p>"}

For them there is nothing obscure or ambiguous in the Senator's 'philosophy\"; nor, in the sense in which they think of philosophy, should there be, for the man's life is the amazing expatiation of his \"philosophy.\"  The emotions involved may be simple and unrealistic, but they are not uncommon....  For a few the critical question for our time may be \"Abundance for What?\"; but for many it is undoubtedly \"Why Not Victory?\"</span></p> <p><span>Those who mourn the fate of the Republican party--the reports of its \"death\" have been greatly exaggerated--may be unpleasantly surprised by Goldwater's showing in the election.  Not only bigots will vote for Goldwater in November, but, many others who will be attracted by his fervent statement of an ideology which seems most expressive of American ideals.</span></p> <p><span>Lest it be supposed that cries of \"freedom\", while good for a round of applause, do not have the impact of \"pocket-book\" issues on the voter, one may recall last year's Wheat Referendum in which over a million wheat growers participated.  Secretary of Agricultture Freeman warned that the defeat of the wheat control program would mean a thirty per cent drop in farm income, but the farmers followed the Farm Bureau's slogan, \"for freedom, vote 'no'\", and a majority voted against the Administration's proposal.  It may be difficult for Eastern liberals to understand, but in those states from which Goldwater gathered his principal support at the convention the nostalagia for \"laisseslaire\" freedom is as real as the hope and the demand of the Negro for \"freedom now\".</span></p> <p><span>Whether you attribute it to prejudice or prosperity, whether you call it bigotry or backlash, anxiety or anomie, there is obviously a discontent in this country of considerable proportions.  To counter it will require more than statistics on economic growth, and more than charges of \"extremism\"....</span></p> <p><span>I am not suggesting that President Johnson and the liberal press forget about the \"issues,\" but  do say that to minimize the Goldwater vote they will have not only to argue the \"issues\", but also to formulate an ideology as appealing as Goldwater's.  One might prefer to reject everything about Goldwater, including his method of appeal, but to do so would be to indulge a sentiment no more rational than those which the Senator peddles. John E.

Allen, 42-years-old and a father of four, was active in voter registration for the Student Non-violent Co-ordinating Commitee.  As a SNCC worker, he must have known the dangers he was facing in Mississippi; Allen witnessed the killing of a fellow SNCC member, Herbert Lee, in 1961.  Last March four other voter registration workers were wounded by gunfire.</span></p> <p><span>People like Allen have been seeking to practice the rights guaranteed to them under law.  The least the nation can do is protect their lives.  Several partial solutions are open to the Johnson Administration.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation has the power to look into many crimes committed in the cause of segregation, but this power is rarely used and is hampered by southern FBI agents who are often in sympathy with the segregationists.  A judicious shift of personnel should be urged on the FBI, and its activities in the South should be increased.  This would be one step towards apprehending those who can now commit their crimes without fear of punishment.</span></p> <p><span>The Justice Department, which so clearly bared its legal muscles before Governor Wallace last year, can use its influence on local sheriffs and other officials.  It has the power, under U.S. law, to prosecute law-enforcement officers who use their position to deprive citizens of their legal rights.  If necessary, federal marshals can be used to protect those who are in immediate danger.</span></p> <p><span>Ten people have been slain during the past year as a result of southern racism.  And the racial conflicts of 1963 are only a prelude to the clashes that will probably occur in 1964.

{"title": "Harold Stassen | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>In a manner obscured by a derisive myth, Harold Stassen bears somewhat the hallmark of a Republican Stevenson.  Though his wit is an auxiliary to (rather than a component of) his thought, and though he relishes politics, unlike the reluctant Democrat, Stassen shares with Stevenson, a first-hand respect for thought and an intellectual boldness, along with a reputation for defeat.</span></p> <p><span>Among the cliches about Stassen is the charge that he is a perennial candidate, having run 20 years for the presidency and lost every time.  In fact, Stassen's name was first entered in a presidential race by some of his friends, while he, then 37, was serving in the Pacific theatre with Admiral Halsey.  In 1948 he did make a serious bid on his own, and was the man to beat until Dewey upset him in the Oregon primary.  Stassen lost the nomination, and his party lost the election from failing to hold the farm vote.  Stassen, three times elected governor of Minnesota (first taking office when only 31), might have held the farm vote and taken his party to the White House.</span></p> <p><span>In 1952, Stassen ran against Taft as a stand-in for Eisenhower, who could not return from Europe until late spring.  Meanwhile, Stassen argued for a liberal foreign policy, and on the first ballot his votes gave Eiseinhower the nomination over Taft.  In the new administration, Stassen served as director of Mutual Security and of Foreign Operations.  He was a member of the National Security Council and participated regularly in Cabinet sessions.  He was appointed Special Assistant for Arms Control, (or, as Eisenhower called him, \"Secretary of Peace\").  In this last capacity, he negotiated seriously with the Soviets in the summer of 1957, proposing steps that make today's test ban look pallid.  In this effort he was frustrated by Dulles.</span></p> <p><span>Another Stassen defeat occurred is the summer of 1956, when he said that polls showed Nixon would detract from the ticket and might cost the Republicans some Congressional seats and statehouses, if not the White House.  He offered Christan Herter of Massachusetts as an alternative.  Nixon and his manager, Leonard Hall, moved fast and ruthlessly to isolate Stassen.  Under this shadow, Stassen in 1958 sought the G.O.P. gubernatorial nomination in his adopted state of Pennsylvania, but was put down by a hostile machine.  In 1959 he ran for mayor of Philadelphia, and lost to Dilworth in a definitively Democratic city.  If we judge Stassen by the men he has fought, his defeats appear in a different light.  His opponents were Taft in '52, Nixon in '56, Dulles in '57.  Moreover, he denounced McCarthy well before the Senate voted to censure their colleague.</span></p> <p><span>It was Stassen who in 1943 presented a proposal for a U.N., and who in 1945 was one of the three Republicans appointed by President Roosevelt to work in drafting the U.N. charter at San Francisco.  In 1947, two weeks before Marshall broached his plan, Stassen presented in detail an extensive program of economic aid for Europe.</span></p> <p><span>Today, as in 1948, Stassen is asking his party for the chance to run against a vice-president brought to the White House by an untimely death.  Now, in the New Hampshire primary, Stassen is beginning to challenge Johnson's leadership, both in foreign policy, where the President has already shown weakness, and in economic renewal at home.  Stassen asks for re-education of those now working below potential who could be trained to enter the service industries, a sector of the economy whose growth Stassen hopes to promote.</span></p> <p><span>Stassen will elaborate his proposals in a speech here Monday night, and afterward in the District of Columbia and California primaries.  Meanwhile, entering the New Hampshire primary months after Rockefeller and Goldwater, Stassen is aiming for 10 per cent of the vote in a state where polls shows 70 per cent of the voters are either undecided or unenthusiastic about the big two.  Whether he is heard will depend on New Hampshire's willingness to consider a man whose ideas have often gone beyond what was congenial to men in control of national power.</span></p>"}

One feels, of course, a glow of quiet pride in the knowledge of our Chief Executive's devoutness.  How onerous it would be to be denied the continuation of this White House tradition.  Our thoughts wander back to that historic night in 1898, when William McKinley knelt in his office in reverent communion with the Lord, before coming to the Mutual Decision to launch his courageous Spanish-American War. Johnson's proposal of a Monument is no more nor less than the fitting and logical culmination of Washington's long standing with the Divine.</span></p> <p><span>After sounding our hearty aye to the President's suggestion, we advance below some possible source of contention, in hope of quick resolutions that will nip incipient opposition in the bud.</span></p> <p><span>1. The concept of a \"monument:\"  Webster's defines such an edifice as \"a building, stone, pillar, or the like, erected in memory of the dead.\"  Neitzche, you may remember, pronounced the Almighty's demise.  Does Johnson concur?  Some, for their own nefarious political purpose, may insinuate that he shares the philosopher's conviction.  These ill-wishers may remind the voters of that compelling syllogism from <i>Thus Spake Zarathustra:</i>  \"If there were Gods, then how could I bear to be no God.  Therefore, there are no Gods.\"</span></p> <p><span>2. Size of Monument:  It would be unfitting to erect a monument to God that is smaller than monuments already existing in Washington in recognition of mortals.  Those honoring Lincoln and Washington, to cite two widely known examples, are rather large.  A memorial grander than these could run into money.</span></p> <p><span>3. Conflict of Religious Sects:  Hopefully, Mr. Johnson's structure will be strictly nondenominational.  Nevertheless, there are upwards of fifty significant sects in the United States holding somewhat heterogeneous concepts of Supreme Being.  One trembles in the face of such diversity.  Historically, it has given rise to knotty complications.  Washington seems an improper site for a contemporary Tower of Babel.</span></p> <p><span>4. Constitutionality of Monument:  Would it violate the first amendment?</span></p> <p><span>5. Design of monument:  Already Washington is a <i>potpourri</i> of architectural styles.  What form would God's Memorial assume?  Let us not be penurious in undertaking such a sanctified construction.  Perhaps a Golden Calf would be appropriate.</span></p> <p><span>All considered, we are confident that the religious leaders of our country will find none of these pitfalls insurmountable.  No scheme of any grandeur is devoid of kinks which must be worked out by sober, intelligent minds.  Jehova's monument will demonstrate that the true image of America, reflected in its capital, is that of, in the words of our President, \"a good and God-fearing people.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "Mayor Daley | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The small square man with a large head and florid face slid his glasses onto his nose, squinted at the lights trained on him from the audience, and began to speak softly.  \"It is an honor to participate in this Law School Forum at a great university,\" he intoned slowly.  Then his voice began to rise, to speed up, and soon he was hurtling through his speech, ignoring punctuation, and catching breath as he needed it.  A bell rang behind him in Rindge Tech, his glasses slid down his nose, but the man continued to talk strenuously about what he knows and knows well--the city of Chicago.</span></p> <p><span>The next morning, seated comfortably in the back seat of a Cadillac, Richard J. Daley rode through the swirling snow of Cambridge to take a look at Harvard.  An extremely serious man, the Mayor has been called \"Buddha\" because of his tendency to sit impassively and listen.  But at any mention of cities, politics or both, he quickly becomes animated.</span></p> <p><span>Under Daley's leadership, Chicago has introduced modern architecture to its school system.  But as he passed the Visual Arts Center, he commented, \"I'm against conformity.  In fact, I encourage innovation, but I don't know about this.\"</span></p> <p><span>The model of Harvard in Widener caused Daley to ask, \"How many acres?\"  When no one could answer, Daley cocked his head, appraised the model carefully, and guessed \"about a hundred, that's a lot of land you know.\"  And the sight of the Faculty Club set off a series of questions about the \"caste system\" in the university.  What was the faculty pecking order?  Who had the power?</span></p> <p><span>Power, says Daley, must be joined with ideals.  But first one must have the power, the \"clout\" as they say in Chicago.  The son of a sheet-metal worker, Daley has spent his life on the public payroll and in the \"organization,\" to reach what some consider the third most important elective office in the United States, following the President and the Mayor of New York.  After helping Jake Arvey, boss of Cook Country's Democratic organization, boost Adlai Stevenson for the governorship in 1948, Daley became county clerk which, in effect, put him in control of patronage and voting machinery, From this position, he could and did build a machine.  By 1955 he was strong enough to buck Arvey and become chairman of the country organization.  He achieved a rare position of strength in city politics by fusing the patronage power of party chairman with the administrative power of mayor.  Because he can hold both jobs, he could argue, he can do each one better.</span></p> <p><span>Daley sees himself as one of a new breed of bosses, those who use extensive powers for public good.  \"Good government is good politics,\" he says, and in the nine years he has been mayor, Chicago has begun the most comprehensive urban renewal program in the United States.  But city-wide planning may result in local discontent.  Daley's voice sharpens when he discusses a small group of citizens who refused to make way for a new branch of the University of Illinois.  \"Everyone wants public works somewhere else besides their own block.  We have a majority government and a minority shall not hold up a needed project,\" he asserts.</span></p> <p><span>When he considers the problem of <i>de jacto</i> segregation, however, Daley's tone changes and so do his ideas.  He thinks a \"betterment of human relations\" is the greatest problem facing the city, and looks to a few integrated communities as the examples which others in the city must follow.  But government, in this case, must act more cautiously.  \"If people have made up their minds about the matter, then the city can only suggest and persuade,\" he declares.  \"People have the right to decide their own neighborhoods.\"</span></p> <p><span>The contradiction between his general support of comprehensive planning and his invocation of local decision making in the touchy question of <i>de facto</i> segregation demonstrates Daley's extreme sensitivity to political pressure.  Although there does not seem any contradiction to him, his opponents charge that his failure to act on such a controversial question is mere political expediency.</span></p> <p><span>It has often been rumored that Daley would run for the Senate or take a cabinet level post as a Director of Urban Affairs.  But as he says, \"I could have gone to Washington a long time ago if I wanted to:  I like the local level, it's closest to the people, and the opportunities for effective leadership are greater.  Besides, Chicago is moving ahead.\"</span></p> <p><span>An early supporter of John F. Kennedy, Daley still uses his language.  But the image of Lyndon Johnson is \"impressive out our way.\"  Non-commital about whom he favors for the vice-Presidency, Daley does not think it will make much difference.  Johnson will win because he is a \"good candidate and a good President.\"  To Mayor Daley it is important that he be both.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Is Congressional Reform Necessary? | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>\"Ha, ha, ha.  And I might add:  ho, ho, ho,\" observed Senator Everett Dirksen of Illinois when recently asked his opinion on a proposed change in a procedural rule.  The Republican Minority Leader's statement expresses concisely, if implicity, the two major reasons for the frustration of Congressional reform:  (1) too many influential members, especially in the Senate, oppose basic reforms, and (2) there is a ludicrous discrepancy between the reformers' highest hopes and the remedial potential of their proposals.</span></p> <p><span>For the Congressman whose power and prestige depend substantially upon certain rules of organization and procedure, and attempt to change these rules jeopardizes his personal position.  The loss of a committee chairmanship would damage the ego and the influence of any legislator anywhere, but the extent of the damage depends largely upon the nature of the legislature.  In a body with serious ideological splits and strict party discipline, little individual bargaining and compromising is possible.  The voting strength of the various blocs within the full membership determines which bills can be passed.  In the U.S. Congress, party discipline is almost unheard of.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>Backstage Bargaining</i></b></span></p> <p><span>Individual members argue means instead of parties arguing ends; disputes are usually handled by compromise rather than conflict.  Only a rather narrow range of passable legislation enjoys a fairly large consensus.  The provisions of a bill that can be passed depend as much upon negotiations in committee and off the record consultations as upon the division of votes in the full body.  Many of the proposed reforms threaten to reduce the disproportionate influence which a few Congressmen exercise over this backstage bargaining.</span></p> <p><span>The existence of an upper echelon within the Senate, and occasionally within the House, has long been a public secret in Washington.  Everyone knows it exists, but the men who belong to the inner circle take only quiet pride in their membership.  The men who hope eventually to work their way into this conclave know they hurt their own chances by talking about it.  Senator Joseph Clark (D-Penn.), who is not a member, insured his continued ostracism by devoting three days on the floor last February to a description of what he called the \"Senate Establishment\" and to a list of fifteen reforms that would disestablish it.</span></p> <p><span>After one year, only two minor items have been voted upon and approved.  The unhappy history and uncertain future of the other reforms testify to fimn resistance from some quarter Whether the resistance originates with the Establishment described by Clark is uncertain.  Opinions and pressure on a particular issue are especially difficult to trace when no major vote has been taken; and Clark's definition of the Establishment was ambiguous to begin with.</span></p> <p><span><i><b>The Establishment</b></i></span></p> <p><span>The Senator spoke of a bipartisan, conservative Establishment that had existed at least from the early years of this century.  He also introduced a list of 21 current Senators comprising a \"preferred group\" by virtue of their committee assignments, but at least eight of the group could be called liberals.  One definition agrees with those who have cited a \"conservative coalition\" or an \"unholy alliance,\" the other with those who see an inner \"club\" based on seniority, ability, and personality, more than on politics.  For Clark, the Establishment may consist, by definition, of the determined opponents of his proposals.  This would resolve the ambiguity of his definition somewhat, since members of both the \"conservative coalition\" in the Senate and the \"club\" have reason to be wary of his proposals.</span></p> <p><span><i><b>The Seniority System</b></i></span></p> <p><span>Some of Clark's reforms are procedural, as are most of the many proposals suggested by other Senators within the last year.  But his more important proposals and suggestions concern the selection and operation of committees.  He does not recommend an end to the seniority system.  He asks instead that it be used quite differently from the way it is now being used.  At present, seniority determines a man's rank on a committee, but not the committees to which he is assigned.  Southerners with long tenure receive chairmanships automatically, while the Democratic Steering Committee (which makes the assignments to the various committees) apparently rewards or punishes others according to their cooperation with the Establishment.</span></p> <p><span>Clark argued that the seniority system should be applied rigorously to committee assignments but that committee chairman be selected by vote of the committee members.  The Senator showed, during his three-day presentation, that six of seven veteran Democrats who received first-choice assignments to new committees had joined the Southerners in opposing a change of the filibuster rule earlier in the year.  Of fourteen veteran Democrats who had opposed the Southerners, only one got his first-choice.  The statistics were similar for second and third choices.</span></p> <p><span>If the Southern members of the Establishment can turn the current rules this decisively to their advantage, their disapproval of any change is most understandable.  This disapproval makes advocacy of changes in the rules difficult for more liberal Democrats in the Senate \"club.\"  They must cooperate in many ways with Southerners who command great influence.  By crossing their nominal and powerful allies on such a crucial issue they would make life (and the passage of legislation) very difficult for themselves.</span></p> <p><span>They also know, partly from the example the Southerners have set, that calculated departures from the seniority system are one of the few weapons they have to encourage party loyalty.  Finally, they know that they, being more senior than most of their colleagues, will soon inherit choice committee chairmanships--<i>if</i> they can maintain patience with the present system!  This argument would be likely to impress even Hubert Humphrey (D-Minn.), whose liberal reputation might well keep him from a voted committee chairmanship.  If the present rules are maintained, however, he will receive a chairmanship that no one could contest, simply by virtue of his seniority.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>The Filibuster</i></b></span></p> <p><span>Regardless of the possibly unified opposition to Clark's proposals from the \"conservative coalition\" and Senate \"club\", these two groups disagree on Rule XXII, the filibuster rule.  If last year's attempt to reduce the majority necessary for ending debate had succeeded, the imminent filibuster over the civil rights bill would not occur, and the strong provisions approved by the House would pass the Senate without significant amendment.  If Senator Clark's reforms of the seniority and committee systems had been in effect, the Southerners could not have kept the civil rights bill from coming to a vote last year by deliberately, but quietly, slowing down the entire legislative process.</span></p> <p><span>The undeniable aid that Congressional reform would have given civil rights legislation within the last few months has encouraged the notion that it could similarly assist other legislation.</span></p> <p><span>However, two inescapable differences between the civil rights bill and most other measures expose the gap between the hopes and the actual potential for Congressional reform:  (1) a majority in Congress will vote for scarcely any new legislative departure other than the civil rights bill and (2) non-legislative demands on Congressmen have lured legislators so far from lawmaking that reforms cannot retrieve them.</span></p> <p><span>Senator Clark contended that only if the organization and procedure of the Senate corresponded to the ideological and geographical composition of the Democratic majority would the Senate be able to enact President Kennedy's programs.  The Senator was correct that an unreformed Senate would obstruct the President, and this will be more true for President Johnson, who is openly advocating a program of social legislation.  Reform will make little difference in the Senate's treatment of his program, however.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>Rules vs. Votes</i></b></span></p> <p><span>Reform would have helped civil rights simply by allowing it to come to a vote, but no one will filibuster against voting on Johnson's domestic and foreign affairs measures, even though many will vote against them.  Once a bill is on the floor, there is very little anyone can do to prevent a Senator from offering any amendments he likes, regardless of how much they change the version approved in committee.  Committee hearings and approval help, of course, but a determined majority on the floor can pass anything.  The final issue is not rules but votes, and the present Congress does not have the votes to be but a little more liberal than it already is.</span></p> <p><span>New rules would give liberal men more bargaining opportunities.  The late Senator Robert Kerr (D-Okla.) used his committee positions with awesome effect.  If he had died in early 1962 instead of early 1963, the Medicare bill would have passed the Senate in the summer of 1962.  Northern liberals would require some time to develop the skills that others are well accustomed to wielding.  Senator Russell Long (D-La.) reportedly explained to the little cabal of liberals filibustering against the communications satellite bill the same summer that he came \"to help the Yankee boys out 'cause they wouldn't even know how to start without some outside help.\"</span></p> <p><span>Even if changes in the rules gave new influence to men like Senator Clark, the ability to exploit this influence would suffer from the continuing growth of the Executive branch, from the growing demand by constituents that Congressmen act as their liaison with the Executive department, and from the increasing amounts of time and money that must be spent campaigning for re-election.</span></p>"}

What hurts is the seemingly frivolous candidacy of an ambitious lady senator with whom he has been playing footsie for months, Margaret Chase Smith of Maine.</span></p> <p><span>Senator Smith announced for the Presidency late.  She began her campaign only three days ago, shaking hands in 29-below weather in the northernmost counties of the state.  She doesn't even like to talk politics:  the 66-year-old Senator prefers to chatter about pie and the weather with the voters she runs across.  But with every hands she shakes, deep in what Rockefeiler has conceded to be heavily Goldwater territory, where she has been campaigning, Senator Smith chips away at the Arizonian's margin.</span></p> <p><span>The lady has adopted the most ancient professional politician's technique of occupying the middle ground, this time the wide-open space between Rockefeller and Goldwater.  In towns where Goldwater bluntly advocated air cover for the Bay of Pigs invasion, Mrs. Smith announces she would have provided cover or not attempted the Cuban landing at all.  Where Goldwater proposed every conceivably frightful means to get the missiles out of Cuba, Senator Smith more mildly suggests she would \"never have lifted the blockade quarantine until on-sight inspection had been allowed.\"</span></p> <p><span>When Goldwater asked President Johnson last week to \"tell Castro to walk back and turn the [Guantanamo's] water on or we are going to march out with a detachment of marines and turn it on,\" Senator Smith decided that silence was pretty golden.</span></p> <p><span>But foreign policy issues such as these are probably largely symbolic to New Hampshire voters:  they serve as guide-posts to how the candidates are spread across the political spectrum.  On the more important domestic issues, the Down Easter holds even stronger ground.  She had never opposed social security, which is likely to hurt Barry in the cities.  On the other side, she cannot remotely be associated with the \"me-too\"  Democratic policies of which Goldwater has accused Rockefeller.</span></p> <p><span>The biggest wedge Senator Smith has in the primary is purely strategic.  Goldwater cannot attack her with anti-Rockefeller vehemence, since she stands so close to his own camp.  Furthermore he has been fending off Rockefeller's challenges throughout the campaign by concentrating largely on President Johnson.  Suddenly altering tactics simply to strike out at Margaret Chase Smith would seem both vindictive and unchivalrous.  Rockefeller, on the other hands, has not attacked Senator Smith since it is Goldwater votes she is taking.</span></p> <p><span>This, then, is precisely the bind which seems likely to strangle the Arizona Senator's Presidential hopes.  Already he has begun to suggest that the New Hampshire contest isn't very important, and that the primary which counts will be California's.  But Goldwater needs victories everywhere to get the nomination, and a loss in New Hampshire is unlikely to help him on the Coast.  He had to have the moralistic anti-Rockefeller votes as well as those of his own ultra-conservatives to win on March 10.  And plucky Senator Smith looks every inch as virtuous as Goldwater facing a divorced man and she has avoided the handicap of Barry's political extremism.  Voters seeking to avoid a distasteful choice between the Governor's \"sin and the Arizonan's Armageddon may leap for Senator Smith's open arms.</span></p> <p><span>But Senator Smith's candidacy and Goldwater's resultant misfortune were, it would seems, avoidable.  First, he didn't have to play into Senator Smith's hands by bellowing his most distasteful positions up and down New Hampshire.  This tactic gave Margaret Chase Smith a chance not only for the moralist vote, but also for the ballots of the less belligerently conservative.  The unexpected sincerity of Goldwater's announcement that the Republicans \"couldn't get old Barry to change his sopts\" may, in fact, have prompted Mrs. Smith's belated candidacy.  Had Barry been more soft-spoken--and he certainly could have been-Mrs.  Smith would not have much ground to stand on.</span></p> <p><span>Another factor working actively against Goldwater is that he has turned out to be a moody and mediocre campaigner.  He has shown little sense of timing in presenting political issues, little feeling for what crowds are important, and a mercurial humor that varies from day to day.  As one commentator put it, \"Mr. Goldwater does not succeed as well as most candidates in conveying complete delight in being with every crowd.\"</span></p> <p><span>Rockefeller, in contrast is a superb campaigner who has met the issue of his divorce with more finesse and dignity than most politicians could muster.  It is still his crippling disadvantage, widely regarded as having cost him the nomination.  Senator Smith's candidacy, however, seems to give him an outside chance.  If her share of the total vote pulls Goldwater's slice well below Rockefeller's, giving the Governor a significant upset in New Hampshire, he could conceivably roll on to subsequent victories in Oregon and California.</span></p> <p><span>The mystery in New Hampshire's race is precisely what Margaret Chase Smith hopes to gain by her candidacy.  The answer is by no means easy.  Obviously, she is gunning for the vice-presidential nomination, but equally obviously she cannot get it if any of the Eastern industrial candidates are nominated for the Presidency.  Ideologically she would be totally at odds with any of them.  Furthermore, she would be of little political value since what they need against President Johnson is support in the South.</span></p> <p><span>The only candidate who could give her a chance for the vice-presidential slot, if such a candidate exists, is Barry Goldwater.  He might want a conservative Northerner under him if, at the convention, the rural and Western Republicans win a chance for a conservative test at the polls.  Mrs. Smith needed, she knew, a big primary success to get within shooting distance of even that.  Paradoxically, she may be blasting her only Presidential hopeful out of the sky in a determined bid to win a place on his ticket.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Housing Message | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The federal government's housing and redevelopment program has-moved a long way since the first housing act in 1937 and the first urban renewal bill in 1947.  President Johnson's housing message to Congress represents another impressive step forward.  It signifies Johnson's realization that the traditional approach to urban redevelopment has been neither as effective nor as intelligent as its original sponsors had hoped.</span></p> <p><span>The President has wisely asked that the government abandon the approach to urban renewal that calls for complete demolition of neighborhoods.  This policy, identified with such irrepressible planners as Robert Moses, too often has resulted in unhappy and unpleasant projects like that in Boston's West End.  The spirit and sense of community were destroyed along with the slums, and the drab, institutionalized replacements are certainly less cohesive and hardly more attractive than the former slum neighborhood.</span></p> <p><span>Johnson has turned to a more selective policy that emphasizes rehabilitation over clearance, and human needs over planners' dreams.  The President has proposed that the government buy and rehabilitate some 50,000 existing units per year; he has also realized the need to protect areas which will themselves become slums without proper maintenance.  At the same time he has urged a more careful approach to the tremendous task of relocation where the \"human cost... remains a serious and difficult problem.\"  157,000 people have been displaced by urban renewal, and less than 17% of them live in public projects.  Often in the past relocation has meant \"only another slum dwelling and the likelihood of the same experience.\"  To prevent this cycle the President has suggested an increased subsidy of $120 a year per unit for families who otherwise would be unable to afford even the lowest rents for decent housing.</span></p> <p><span>Johnson has not neglected entirely two difficult problems before cities today:  a shortage of housing and the sad fact (Jane Jacobs notwithstanding) that some housing is so blighted that rehabilitation is impossible.  Unfortunately his proposal for 50,000 new units in addition to those undergoing rehabilitation is inadequate to cope with the present needs, much less with those that high birthrates among low income groups will create.  The $1.4 billion allocation must be increased; moreover, the red tape that at present allows a lapse of up to five years between a project's inception and its execution must be reduced radically.</span></p> <p><span>While the amount of housing should be increased, the quality of design also should be improved.  The present type of barracks-like building too often jars aesthetically with the neighborhood in which it is located and discourages people who would otherwise want to live in public housing.  In Boston's West End, for example, 74% of those who were to be moved said they preferred not to live in a project.  More attention to attractive and thoughtful designs is necessary.  Architectural competitions like those in many European cities and a few American ones should be mandatory.</span></p> <p><span>Although President Johnson has glided too easily over the need for more housing and the importance of architectural diversity and imagination, this is not the major fault of his message.  More important, he fails to see the potential uses of housing in combatting the large problems before all American cities.  At present, expenditures for social services are, at very best, preventing problems from spreading rather than solving them; furthermore the money to permit expansion of existing programs is very limited.  Already city tax rates are so high that many businesses and large property owners have moved to the suburbs to avoid them, and no sudden financial windfall appears likely.</span></p> <p><span>What is needed is a new approach, or at very least an altered montage of present programs.  The key to any such change lies in the neighborhood.  If individuals within a community can be organized to deal with their own problems, if self-help can be encouraged, then cities might be better able to meet the giant challenges before them.</span></p> <p><span>Housing is vital to the creation of a sense of community that could deal effectively with neighborhood problems.  But President Johnson's message dealt only with the importance of neighborhoods in the suburbs.  He failed to see that the need for them is greatest in the city.</span></p> <p><span>Public housing in cities blocks a sense of community in two ways.  First, often a project stands completely apart from the area in which it was built.  As Jane Jacobs has written, \"One of the unsuitable ideas behind projects is the very notion that they are projects, abstracted out of the normal city.\"  Second, tenants in a redevelopment project have little contact with each other and little interest in the project itself.  Life is fragmented, and responsibility is abdicated to the bureaucracy that runs the project.  This situation has had a powerful effect on integration in housing; although Negroes live next to whites, usually there has been little interchange between them.</span></p> <p><span>Although neither of these difficuties can be eliminated easily, much more could be done now.  The Federal Housing Administration requires local authorities to obey certain rules before they can receive funds; it might extend its regulations to include the following:</span></p> <p><span>* Projects should be designed so that they blend into their surroundings.</span></p> <p><span>* Attention must be given to the effect of design on the inhabitants.</span></p> <p><span>* Tenants should have an opportunity to become involved in the management of their projects.</span></p> <p><span>* Community organizations (even those aimed at the management) should be encouraged.</span></p> <p><span>* Self-help programs should be stimulated by trained staff-workers.</span></p> <p><span>* The population of projects should be varied on the basis of income as well as race.</span></p> <p><span>This is not to say that the President's message is unimpressive, for it is a thoughtful document deserving of Congressional action.  But unfortunately the vision is neither as broad nor the goals as far-sighted as they should be.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Will Rights Drive Hurt Peace Groups? | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Peace groups are becoming more and more concerned with domestic issues, especially civil rights, according to H. Stuart Hughes, professor of History, and David Riesman '31, Henry Ford II Professor of Social Sciences.</span></p> <p><span>Commenting on Tocsin's recent decision to extend its scope beyond disarmament, the two men agreed that the excitement and accomplishment of the civil-rights movement last summer had drawn many supporters from the peace groups.

{"title": "Billy Graham | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>\"Why have you come to Harvard, Dr. Graham,\" the television interviewer asked, and without a pause, Billy Graham was off.  \"The college student today has a greater religious inquiry than any generation before. . .the questions they ask are totally different. . . . Today they ask 'How can I keep my intellectual integrity and believe in God?'  . . . They are searching for standards, for a flag to follow. . .\"</span></p> <p><span>The phrases slipped out smoothly, effortlessly, just as they had moments before while Graham was answeing the same question for a press conference.  They would come out again the next night when he spoke at Wellesley, and still again a night later when he stood before a thousand Harvard students at Rindge Tech.  Probably the students who heard Graham at Princeton and Michigan earlier this month heard the same phrases.</span></p> <p><span>Yet as he faced the camera, Billy Graham's face betrayed no boredom or fatigue.  The enunciation was precise, his tone not monotonous, but rolling.  In fact, he seemed excited as he leaned foreward, his eyes trained on the camera with the same intense, steady glare he turns on his audiences during a speech, on a listener during an interview.</span></p> <p><span>Graham at a press conference reminds one of a politician delivering his \"set speech,\" and of one politician in particular, Billy Graham and Barry Goldwater have more in common than the initials they use.  They both combine passionate beliefs with personal flair; neither is an original thinker and neither is an original stylist, yet each has risen far above others who profess similar beliefs in somewhat the same manner.  As Gold water is a cut above John Tower and H.R. Gross, so Graham seems far removed from Oral Roberts and the other nameless faith-healing Protestant evengelists.</span></p> <p><span>Graham is at a loss to explain his power over his audiences.  \"That's one of the first things I'm going to ask God when I get to Heaven, because I don't know.  I'm the most ordinary person in the world.  I'm amazed at it all; to me it's just God.  It's sovereignty of God in choosing me as he did Jeremiah, or Isaiah.\"</span></p> <p><span>Graham does not, however, see himself as a prophet like Isaiah and Jeremiah.  \"When I first heard myself called an evangelist, I resented it--I thought of Elmer Gantry.  But I've come to like it.  It comes from a Greek word meaning 'proclaimer'; an evangelist is a proclaimer of the good news that God loves us and wants to help us.\"</span></p> <p><span>Though he does not think himself a prophet, Graham can sound like Jonah addressing the men of Ninevah:  \"We're approaching a crisis that will make Cuba look pale, and you only have to read the papers to see it.  The explosive points around the world are increasing rapidly; it seems as if the whole world is catching fire.\"</span></p> <p><span>Graham's solution to the growing crisis is purely religious.  He refuses to classify himself politically.  \"I don't like people to label me liberal or conservative,\" he says.  \"I want to be all things to all men.  That's St. Paul's phrase.\"  The evangelist's ideologically balanced public statements make one aware that he is conscious of Paul's dictum.  \"I believe every word of the Bible, from Genesis to Revelations,\" he says, but again \"the Bible isn't a scientific document; it's written for the common people, in language they can understand.\"  And again, \"I disagree with some points in Tillch, though I respect his right to his opinion.\"</span></p> <p><span>Graham adds to his balanced, careful sentences a politician's forced modesty.  \"I'm in the line of these people,\" he says, comparing himself to great evangelists of the past, like St. Augustine and St. Francis of Assisi.  But he quickly adds, \"I'm the least of them all. . . . I shouldn't be mentioned in the same breath with them. . .I'm not worthy. . . .\" The words have the hollow sound of a statement which once was passionately sincere but which had been eroded by constant flattery until its speaker had come almost to disbelieve it.</span></p> <p><span>Above all, like a campaigner and yet far better than most politicians, Graham, understands his audiences.  \"People are the same deep down,\" he explains, \"but you do have to vary your approach a little.\"  His Harvard speeches lacked the hardline moralizing Graham sometime presents, and they were spiced with quotations from Sartre, and Kant.  But the appeal, to be born again in God, was the same.</span></p> <p><span>Yet his speaking ability, his understanding of his audiences, his modesty, could get Graham no-where without the obvious sincerity of his beliefs.  The word \"sincere\" is one that is applied over and over both to him and to Barry Goldwater; the word \"commitment\" crops up again and again in Graham's speeches.  Graham, like Goldwater is often criticized for presenting simple answers to complex problems.  The words of each man, read in cold print, seem fantastically foolish to some people.  Yet when he presents his views in person, each man wins the approval of almost any audience.  Graham's semi-fundamentalist views win applause at Rindge Tech just as Goldwater's discourses on poverty receive standing ovations from his listeners.</span></p> <p><span>What is Graham's goal?  \"If just one student out at Harvard would go back to his room tomorrow night and make a commitment to Christ, who knows what might come of it?\"  He went on to describe how Dwight Moody once told a young Scottish convert to \"go do something for the laboring people of Scotland;\" the convert went on to found the British Labour Party.  Graham sat back in his chair, looking towards the ceiling, his phenomenal nervous enegy no longer so obvious.  \"These men did evangelists' work, men like John Wesley, and Dwight L. Moody, and William Wilberforce.  We've forgotten today how the evangelist is as important as the pastor and the teacher.\"</span></p> <p><span>Suddenly he sat forward, his eyes again fixed on his listener; \"Of course I'm not worthy to lick these men's boots. . . . I shouldn't be mentioned. . . .\" And he was off again.</span></p>"}
{"title": "De Gaulle's Chance | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>When President de Gaulle begins his visit to Latin America in three weeks, he will be making his boldest bid for leadership of a separate bloc of free nations since France began its strategy of independence.</span></p> <p><span>That is why U.S. relations with Latin America are likely to look different next month, and a good deal less cordial than when President Johnson and Mexico's Adolfo Lopez Mateos meet in Los Angels today.  Despite disagreement on the use of Colorado River water and recognition of Red China, U.S. Mexican relations represent the smoothest side of our hemispheric affairs.  The two countries have amicably settled the Chamizal border dispute, and Mexican Alliance for Progress projects have been successful.</span></p> <p><span>But the conversations in Palm Springs-or at least the communiques-are likely to gloss over the uglier problems:  Guantanamo, Panama, and above all wide-spread Latin American doubts about the new administration's sensitivity to the area's needs.</span></p> <p><span>Precisely what remains hidden today, however, is what we should expect de Gaulle's visit next month to unearth.  The General is hoping that Latin uneasiness with U.S. pressures on Panama after the Canal Zone riots and South American distaste at Johnson's \"over-reaction\" to minor provocation at Guantanamo will push many of the southern continent's leaders toward the French camp.</span></p> <p><span>Most of all, de Gaulle suspects that if he can offer economic support and an attractive political alternative to the single-minded leadership of Moscow or Washington, many Latin American nations would consider joining him.</span></p> <p><span>De Gaulle he laid his groundwork carefully:  Five members of the French Parliament are currently touring Latin America, emphasizing the advantage of closer cultural and economic relations with France.  Last week, de Gaulle announced with some fanfare that Germany and France would cooperate on aid to Latin America, giving increased credence to his claim that alternatives to dependence on the United States exist.  Finally, he has recognized Communist China, a step that appeals to both Mexico and Brazil.  These two countries have hesitated to extend recognition, fearing U.S. reprisals.  But when de Gaulle visits Brasilia and Mexico City next month, he is likely to point out that the ban on recognition has been broken, and to offer Mexico and Brazil this symbolic opportunity to assert their independence.</span></p> <p><span>Even if de Gaulle does not succeed in cutting the umbilical-cord to the north in a single blow, he is likely to give it a couple of hard twists.  Regardless of what economic aid he can offer, the General is a sympathetic figure to Latin Americans of almost every political hue.  His military uniform, and the order and prosperity he has brought to France appeal to the rightists.  The grant of Algerian independence and his neutralist foreign policy appeal heavily to the left.  Most of all, he has led a small country in dignified and reasonable resistance to the dogmatism of the United States.</span></p> <p><span>But de Gaulle hasn't won this chance to bid for leadership in Latin America without help.  A great deal of credit for any realignment de Gaulle achieves should go to Lyndon Johnson, whose insensitivity to Latin American opinion is only rivaled in recent years by the efforts of the Eisenhower Administration.</span></p> <p><span>First, Johnson ignored the sixty prominent Latin American delegates to the third Pan American Interparliamentary Conference.  Many of these leaders had journeyed to Washington specifically to hear assurances that the \"special relationship\" between Latin America and the U.S.-built up during the Kennedy Administration-would continue.  Johnson never spoke to them.</span></p> <p><span>Then, the Inter-American Economic and Social Council elected a new executive committee to head the Alliance for Progress.  Johnson payed no public attention to this meeting, either.  Finally, he met one afternoon with the Finance Minister of Colombia, Carlos Sanz de Santamaria, who will preside over the Alliance executive committee.  But no communique was forthcoming, and the two failed to pose for front-page news photographs as Kennedy so often did.</span></p> <p><span>Although the Johnson Administration should not be judged on three months in office, it is impossible not to draw inferences from what the President has done so far about his interests and abilities.  In Latin American affairs, LBJ has given de Gaulle a chance to break the cold war alignment and to form his own independent bloc.  Whether or not de Gaulle succeeds, whether or not de Gaulle's position has merit, the chance seems not only from the General's diplomatic daring.  It also seems due to Johnson's ineptitude.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Petty Petulance | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The Johnson Administration has acted with hollow petulance in cutting off military aid to three countries and suspending it to two others for trading with Cuba.  Although the effects of suspending aid to Morocco and Spain are as yet undetermined, the removal of a piddling $100,000 to France, England; and Yugoslavia will have little or no impact on their trading policies.</span></p> <p><span>Severing aid to France and England is essentially a symbolic gesture; nonetheless it is a bitter irony that Castro has caused the United States to refuse military aid to its oldest partners in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.  No less ironic is the fact that only the Cuban dictator could bring an end to military aid to a dictator in Spain.  The curtailment of funds to France is a classic example of doing the right thing for the wrong reasons.</span></p> <p><span>Although it did not issue a statement of explanation, presumably the Administration feels that the withdrawal of aid will serve as a warning to the 14 other countries which trade with Cuba.</span></p> <p><span>In affronting two members of NATO, the Johnson administration can only have weakened that increasingly shaky alliance by giving de Gaulle further reason to demand independent national action.  And the aid cutback will probably be used as effective anti-American propaganda in Latin America to substantiate the Castroite charge that we are bellicose and impotent.</span></p> <p><span>President Johnson did not have to enforce the Cuban trade embargo.  Although the 1963 Foreign Aid Act bans assistance to countries transporting merchandise to Cuba, it gives the President discretionary powers for enforcement.  Instead of resisting emotional cries for action, Johnson has chosen to adopt a harsh foreign policy, to indulge in \"get-tough\" posturing.</span></p> <p><span>If Johnson had hoped to demonstrate decisiveness in foreign affairs, the curtailment of aid was not the way to do it.  Not only can his rigidity cause immediate harm in Latin America and Europe, but in the long run it may make a conservative Congress even more reluctant to accept necessary, flexible measures.  The trade embargo simply will not isolate Cuba economically.  By seeking to enforce it unilaterally, Johnson has succeeded in alienating our friends without hurting Castro.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Not So Grand Wizard | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The mellifluent, loquacious, rumpled, dimpled, damp, and wondrous Wizard of Ooze has done it again; Senator Everett McKinley Dirksen has confounded nearly everyone by announcing that he will place in nomination at the Republican convention the name of a man whom he denounced strongly in the Senate only eleven days ago.</span></p> <p><span>Judging motives in politics is always a highly popular but exceedingly tricky business.  And discovering the motivation underlying the meanderings of the shaggy Senator is unusually difficult.  Dirksen, always theatrical, would give reporters no explanation for his decision, \"Why I did it because I wanted to,\" he said with almost puckish glee.</span></p> <p><span>Dirksen may have \"wanted to\" for a number of reasons, the most obvious and least likely being a desire for the vice-Presidential nomination.  As an old and potent Senator it is highly improbable that he wants to trade his seat as Minority Leader for the second spot on the ticket.  (Analogies between him and Lyndon Johnson must be tempered by the fact that Johnson was 52 when he became Vice-President, Dirksen is 69.)</span></p> <p><span>More likely, Dirksen wanted to avoid embarrassment in his own delegation which was strongly committed to Goldwater and over which he had little or no control.  But this only explains his vote, not the nominating speech.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>A \"Reasonable\" Image</i></b></span></p> <p><span>Some suggest that Dirksen wanted to placate the conservative wing of the party.  This they argue, gives him the image of a \"reasonable\" man and allows him to exert strenuous leadership in support of vital, liberal, bi-partisan measures like the Test Ban Treaty and the Civil Rights Bill.</span></p> <p><span>But such a view is unwarranted.  No one in recent weeks has discerned a deterioration of Dirksen's prestige; it has, in fact, never been higher.  More to the point, it assumes that Dirksen is more consistently liberal than he actually is.</span></p> <p><span>Until his vote in favor of the foreign aid bill two years ago, Dirksen was regarded as being much farther right than he seems now, although he could at times be a maverick from the conservative cause.  Since then he has cultivated the image of a statesmanlike, middle of the road Minority Leader, and backed it up with some key votes which brought him boundless praise.  But Dirksen's support of Goldwater merely reaffirms the central fact of his political life when seen in the perspective of 30 years in Washington.</span></p> <p><span>Dirksen always waits until the last moment, tests the wind, builds suspense, and then throws his support to the seemingly popular side.  If he is wrong (as in his opposition to the Marshall plan, federal housing, rural electrification, or even the test ban treaty) he doesn't stay wrong for very long.</span></p> <p><span><b>The Time for Goldwater</b></span></p> <p><span>Clearly Ev feels that the time for Goldwater is now and he would strengthen his own position within the party by supporting him.  Moreover, his political philosophy isn't always so radically different from Goldwater's.  Besides, Goldwater will do the most for the Republican party in the fall elections.  One could not of course expect Ev Dirksen to stop playing politics.  But his hypocrisy in boosting Goldwater after earning plaudits over civil rights is monumental.</span></p> <p><span>It was also unnecessary.  In a divided Republican party, Dirksen could have rested comfortably on the other side.  By supporting a candidate who must rely heavily on placating the South, Dirksen is potentially threatening the very bill he helped to pass, is acting with a cynical disregard for an issue which deeply troubles his party and as little as two weeks ago seemed deeply to trouble him.</span></p>"}

But what is much more worrisome is what he was thinking last night while he was mouthing such nothings.  Not one specific issue or controversy was mentioned in the Senator's speech.  It was obvious, however, that his supporters were thinking of specifics when they gave the largest cheer of the evening to Goldwater's pronouncement that \"extremism in the pursuit of freedom is not necessarily a vice.\"</span></p> <p><span>We can only hope that this speech is not an indication of the pattern of Mr. Goldwater's coming campaign.

{"title": "Scranton Camp Desolate After Loss | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>SAN FRANCISCO, July 17--Gloom prevailed here today as a few remaining Scranton workers supervised the reconversion of their convention headquarters into a floor of hotel rooms.</span></p> <p><span>In many of the rooms groups sat in front of television sets and watched vice-presidential nominee William E. Miller, Richard M. Nixon, and Senator Barry M. Goldwater address the final session of the Republican National Convention.  Very few Scranton supporters went to the Con-Palace today.</span></p> <p><span>There was little doubt in anyone's mind that Goldwater would win the nomination on the first ballot last night, but there was a particular shock of disappointment and distress when the South Clarolina delegation cast the votes which made it official.</span></p> <p><span>On the chartered buses from the Cow Palace to San Francisco last night, in the halls of the former campaign headquarters, and wherever they gathered.  Scranton devotees were predicting a difficult and perhaps disastrous campaign.</span></p> <p><span>A large number of them--most have been Republicans all their lives--will support President Johnson against the challenge of a philosophy they find alien to their progressive brand of Republicanism.  They are outwardly offended by Goldwater's apparent appeal to the \"white backlash\" vote and to the extremist groups of the far right.</span></p> <p><span>Despite the fact that their leader had thrown his support to Goldwater, his workers here are generally convinced that the \"coronation\" of the Arizona conservative spells certain defeat for the Republican party in November.</span></p> <p><span>One common sentiment of these people is their total admiration for and commitment to Scranton, a man for whom many volunteered weeks of hard work with little return.  They are gathering this evening at a party with the Scranton family in the Mark Hopkins Hotel for all workers.  They know their candidate will not have an office from which to project himself into the presidential race in 1968, but they are nevertheless confident of a bright political future for him.</span></p> <p><span>The feeling of the Scranton organization is perhaps best summed up by a sign on an elevator door on the 12th floor of the Mark Hopkins.

{"title": "Johnson's Running Mate | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>\"The Vice President is about as valuable as a cow's fifth teat,\" John Nance Carner declared with some feeling over twenty years ago.  Today that statement may draw a laugh but surely not acquiescence.  When national magazines run features like \"The President's Heart:  A Blunt Appraisal,\" and political writers consult actuarial tables, it is not an overstatement that the selection of a Democratic Vice Presidential candidate has a critical importance.</span></p> <p><span>Of course no Presidential nominee names his running mate on the assumption that, if elected, he will fail to finish out his term in office.  As everyone knows, politics not Presidential stature is the key determinant of the second spot on the ticket; 1960 was only a fortuitous exception.</span></p> <p><span>But 1964 may help to make the exception, if not a rule, then at least a tradition.  The Democrats have a chance to nominate a man whose proven ability at least equals his striking political strength, Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>Political Strength</i></b></span></p> <p><span>In political terms, Humphrey's value is no less potent with the nomination of Barry Goldwater than it would have been had Rockefeller or Scranton been the nominee; it is in fact, probably greater.  As a Northern liberal, staunch friend of the Negro, strong supporter of labor, and articulate internationalist, it is a well-worn argument that Humphrey would have shorn up Johnson's left flank in the North-east had a moderate Republican governor been the opposition.</span></p> <p><span>But now that section is locked up for Johnson and the pivotal area in the election has changed.  Even if Goldwater were to carry the South (including the border states) and the West minus California, he could not be elected unless he dented a number of Mid-western states; Illinois, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Missouri, Michigan, and Ohio.  And it is precisely in these key states that the Minnesota Senator's appeal is strongest.  As representative of a farm state and expert rural campaigner, Humphrey will undoubtedly hold some of the farm vote from Goldwater while at the same time helping Johnson in the one or two large cities of each state so vtal to an electoral victory.</span></p> <p><span>Moreover, even in the South Humphrey, although hardly popular would be less of a liability than Bobby Kennedy whose name has become an oath.  (It's not passing the law but enforcing it that is the sin.)</span></p> <p><span><b><i>A Record of Substance</i></b></span></p> <p><span>But these political assets only make a strong case stronger since they stem from a record of substance and consistency.  As William Shannon wrote succinctly in a recent issue of <i>The New Republic.</i>  \"Humphrey, to his credit, during the difficult years of the '50's committed none of the political mortal sins; cynicism, quietism, opportunism.\"  In fact, since then Humphrey, unlike other liberals like Joseph Clark of Pennsylvania or Paul Douglas of Illinois, has gained considerable influence, evidenced by his role as Majority whip, and yet has compromsed issues not principles in doing so.</span></p> <p><span>No one accuses Humphrey of tardiness in supporting civil rights; as early as 1948 he forced the Democratic convention to throw out a milder civil rights plank and include his stronger version.  No one accuses him of a superficial interest in disarmament; in 1955 he proposed and helped pass a resolution to set up a disarmament subcommittee of which he became chairman.  And no one accuses him of representing limited interests, of lacking imagination:  he was first, for example, to suggest a Peace Corps and Medicare under Social Security.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>Kennedy or McNamara?</i></b></span></p> <p><span>At present his competition comes from Secretary McNamara because his appeal to business will help Johnson ensnare dissident Republicans and from Bobby Kennedy because his Catholicism will counter that of Congressman Miller.  (Sargent Shriver appears to be a casualty of the war on poverty.)</span></p> <p><span>Politically, however, both men cannot match Humphrey.  It seems silly that now a Catholic <i>qua</i> Catholic must adorn a national ticket.  Besides, Kennedy's electoral strength only duplicates Johnson's and Bobby would hurt him elsewhere.  McNamara, never having held an elected office, has demonstrated no political ability, and his analytical mind and relance on expertise seem suited to a purely administrative role rather than a more political one in which success is measured by the ability to conciliate and compromise.</span></p> <p><span>Still, President Johnson may be wary of losing the virtual (and highly effective) leader of Senate Democrats.  But Humphrey (who is indeed good but not indispensable) would gladly exchange his place in the Senate for the Vice-Presidential chair in the Cabinet room.  And by almost any standard he deserves it.  Either by dint of strong leadership in the Senate, or a distinguished record over sixteen years in Congress, or the strength he would add to the ticket.  Humphrey should be the Democratic nominee for Vice President.  It only remains for President Johnson to designate him so at Atlantic City in August.</span></p>"}

And, second, they will point out all delegates to the convention are pledged to uphold the ideals of the Party; many Mississippi delegates are known Goldwater supporters.</span></p> <p><span>One of the ironic effects of the MFDP's crusade has been to squeeze President Johnson in a tight political vise.</span></p> <p><span>If the MFDP is not seated, Johnson probably will not feel the effects of a Negro backlash at the polls in November, since Goldwater's nomination did not leave them with much choice in the election.  But Robert Moses, head of the Mississippi Summer Project, indicated privately last week two possible consequences of Presidential opposition to the MFDP:</span></p> <p><span>* Negroes may become dissatisfied with the regular Democratic Party, and make this dissatisfaction felt--by forming their own party.</span></p> <p><span>* Johnson could be faced with widespread riots and demonstrations in the North; there are, reportedly, plans to publicize the MFDP campaign for recognition in Harlem and other Northern cities.</span></p> <p><span>If, on the other hand, the MFDP delegation is seated in Atlantic City, it will be a slap at the majority of Democrats in the Magnolia State and throughout the South.  Johnson knows that his political support below the Mason-Dixon line is tottering.  Supporting the MFDP won't endear him to many white Southerners, and the obvious compromise--seating both delegations--would not appease them, and would in fact, be a major victory for Negroes and civil rights workers in Mississippi.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Barry Goldwater | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>It was a subdued and somewhat dispirited Barry Goldwater who carried his crusade to revitalize moral America into Fenway Park last Thursday night.  Perhaps a day's campaigning begun in Duluth, continued in Madison, Wisconsin, and concluded in Boston had done him in, maybe the hopelessness of his cause in the Northeast had quelled any enthusiasm, but Goldwater, having long ago descended from the rarefied, steely heights of the Cow Palace, spoke with a weary, methodical voice, like a man tramping through a bog.  His campaign was at slack tide, and Goldwater showed what George Gallup <i>et. al.</i> have been telling us all along.</span></p> <p><span>The invocation of Lincoln by an introductory speaker brought cheers from the crowd but could not bring the Senator's vacant eyes off the shoetops of the person next to him.  And before he was four minutes into his demand for \"law and order in this nation,\" he betrayed his <i>ennui,</i> one might say world sadness; the teleprompter stopped, so did Goldwater, and for one long moment his eyes went up and back into his mind, slowly searching for the key phrase which would unleash a mindless string of sentences to sustain him until he could switch back to the safety of the moving words.</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps Senator Saltonstall most succinctly caught the tone of the evening when he rendered a variation on the ageless rhetorical device by introducing Goldwater as \"the man who is not....\"  For the man who was to give a choice not an echo is now reduced to fighting with vague cries, against crime and for morality, his shibboleth being, \"in your hearts you know I'm right.\"  On almost any issue of substance the erstwhile challenger is on the defensive, his own words echoing uncomfortably around his ears.  \"I am,\" he must tell even his partisan audience, \"not a warmonger but a peacemonger.\"  \"Let me make this absolutely clear,\" he repeats again and again.</span></p> <p><span>That Goldwater has constantly been forced to explicate his rather ambivalent texts is of course nothing extraordinary; but his wearied; <i>pro-forma</i> rebuttals suggests new sense of the frustration of it all.</span></p> <p><span>The loss of momentum is seen too in Goldwater's choice of words.  In 1960, Nixon telegraphed his own sense of defeat when he began to adopt Kennedy's language, when he too insisted that America must move forward.  Now it is Goldwater solemnly (and unconsciously) explaining the need for prudence and responsibility in the Executive branch.</span></p> <p><span>This is not to say that the Senator has abandoned those stylistic pecularities which have drawn so much criticism.  He is still the master of the blinding contradiction; his administration, as Walter Lippman tells us bi-weekly, will try to reduce the size of the Federal government while somehow reducing crime throughout the nation and building up defenses to thwart communism abroad.  He still expounds the paradoxical platitude--at once grandiose and simplistic; to stop crime the President, \"in making appointments to the federal judiciary, must consider the need to redress constitutional interpretation <i>in favor of the public</i> (underlining his).\"  And he still reveres history while being blatantly a historical.</span></p> <p><span>But the assured relaxed frankness which makes up much of the Goldwater image was muted.  As one national reporter who has been travelling with the Senator put it, \"For about the last week he has been in a cocoon, thinking his own thoughts even while speaking.\"  This sounds suspiciously like introspection, a quality no one has yet accused Goldwater of possessing.</span></p> <p><span>With a little over a month to go and the polls, the press, and a mostly political President Johnson conspiring against his efforts to reach the \"people,\" those minions outside the ambitions of big business, big labor and big government, Goldwater may be losing his poise and confidence; the reporter suggested his will to win.  This may have little bearing on the election's final outcome, but it could have a vital effect on what many people consider a more important (that is, uncertain) matter, his leadership of the Republican party after November 3.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Texas in State of Confusion Since Assassination; Johnson Supported By Both Liberals, Conservatives | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>In the year since his succession to the Presidency, Lyndon Johnson has so ingeniously manipulated national politics that he currently enjoys an endorsement he hopes may bring a return to the Era of Good Feeling.  In his native Texas, he enjoys the same widely divergent support that he does on a national scale but there it has created more chaos than good feeling.  The warring elements of the Democratic Party, the liberals and conservatives, have rarely been so confused.</span></p> <p><span>Johnson inherited from Kennedy not only the White House but a liberal program and the leadership of a liberal party.  In Texas, President Johnson--like Vice-President Johnson and Senator Johnson before him--was master of the conservative wing of that party; his friends were conservatives, his benefactors were conservatives, his patronage went to conservatives.</span></p> <p><span>His voting record in the Senate had always been relatively liberal and his sentiment on national issues was the same, but at home he was an undoubted conservative.  He protected the oil depletion allowance more assiduously than he ever espoused liberal ideas and the political machinery he had masterfully welded had few elements that were not right of center.</span></p> <p><span>The liberal wing was led by Senator Ralph Yarborough and the animosity between Johnson and Yarborough was both deep and dramatic.  It was during President Kennedy's trip to Texas, in fact, that this rivalry reached some of its most heated moments.  There was substantial fear among the liberals that the money being raised by the chief political event on the President's schedule, a $100 a plate dinner to be held November 23rd, would be used by the conservatives to unseat Yarborough and keep liberals out of state offices.  The Senator had even refused to ride in the same car with the Vice-President until Kennedy ordered him to do so in Dallas.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>Situation Confused</i></b></span></p> <p><span>But when Lyndon Johnson was elevated to the Presidency the situation in Texas was clouded.  As it became clear that Johnson would carry on the Kennedy program and, indeed, enlarge upon it and get it passed, most of the liberals of Texas found themselves supporting the man they had so often opposed.</span></p> <p><span>Within the state, however, Johnson's conservative associates were doing business as usual.  John Connally, as Governor, was the ranking member of the state party and also headed its conservative element.  Although he served for a short time as Secretary of the Navy in the Kennedy government, his campaign for Governor had been based on an essentially anti-Kennedy platform; he was opposed to the civil rights bill, to Medicare, and to many other key points in the New Frontier.</span></p> <p><span>At the same time he was one of Johnson's oldest and closest allies.  \"I love him like a brother,\" Johnson once said, \"I love him more than I do Sam Houston.\"  Like Johnson, Connally had often quarreled with Ralph Yarborough but, unlike Johnson, had not settled his differences with him.  When Don Yarborough, a fellow liberal and close associate of Ralph Yarborough's but no relation, announced that he would again oppose Connally in the Democratic Primary, Connally was gravely offended and decided to launch a major attack on the liberals.</span></p> <p><span>His first task, of course, was to find an opponent for Ralph Yarborough which he did by persuading conservative Joe Kilgore to run for the Senate rather than for re-election to Congress.  Then the Governor of Texas received a telephone call from the President of the United States and Kilgore withdrew.  Senator Yarborough was left with only one opponent, a Dallas broadcaster who conducted one of the dirtiest campaigns of recent times but lost none-theless.</span></p> <p><span>The rift between Johnson and Connally was short-lived but it was enough to encourage the liberals considerably.  They concluded that the President was committed to a liberal program and wanted to see men elected to the Senate who would support that program.  They hoped also that he might be remembering the lessons he learned as a protege to Franklin Roosevelt.</span></p> <p><span>They sometimes suggested that perhaps his ancient support for local conservatives was based on the fact that Johnson was a pragmatic politician with a basically conservative constituency; now that the entire nation was his electorate Johnson could pursue his liberal views more freely.  And a number of them believed that the Presidency had washed away the clinging conservatives and made him clean.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>Liberal Solutions?</i></b></span></p> <p><span>\"The only thing left for Lyndon Johnson,\" a leading Texas liberal said recently, \"is for history to remember him in a fine sort of way.\"  In order to achieve this remembrance, it was reasoned, Johnson would tackle the greatest problems of the day:  peace, poverty, civil rights.  The solution to these problems are inevitably liberal ones and so the liberals were encouraged.</span></p> <p><span>But at the same time there was the nagging problem of local politics.  Governor Connally was handily re-elected, garnering an immense sympathy vote for his having been wounded when President Kennedy was killed.  He then set about to increase his hold on the Texas Democratic Party.  In all the significant counties of the state, the Connally forces and the liberals battled to gain control of the delegations to the state convention.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>Connally Triumphs</i></b></span></p> <p><span>In San Antonio, where the liberals are stronger than any place else in Texas, Connally's supporters were greatly out-numbered at the county convention and so they walked out, held a rump convenion, and named their own delegates to the state convention.  The Connally-dominated credentials committee at the State Convention seated the illegitimate delegation and Connally's control was complete.  At county conventions where liberals prevailed, resolutions had been passed endorsing President Johnson and his program; where Connally prevailed, the President was endorsed but never his program.</span></p> <p><span>By controlling the state convention, Connally also gained control of the Texas delegation to the Democratic National Convention and a conservative delegation it was:  one of Texas' representatives on the platform committee was Price Daniel, a former Governor who enacted three anticivil rights bills during his time in office.  Connally is also systematically removing the liberals from the state Democratic Executive Committee.</span></p> <p><span>The President has so far attempted to remain outwardly aloof from the conflicts in Texas.  He did choose Governor Connally to place his name in nomination at the Atlantic City convention but that was natural enough since Connally was chairman of the delegation from Johnson's home state.  He has also gone to great lengths to cement his relations with Ralph Yarborough and there is no doubt that the Senator wholeheartedly supports him.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>And Texas Too?</i></b></span></p> <p><span>There is some possibility that Johnson will succeed in staying out of the fights in Texas even after the election; \"he's got the world now,\" a friend of his has said, \"why should he bother with Texas?\"  But the in-fighting may grow so intense that he will be forced to intercede, for Johnson has no fondness for unmended fences.</span></p> <p><span>In spite of these squabbles, the Johnson-Humphrey ticket will carry Texas by a better margin than the Kennedy-Johnson ticket did and might even win sixty per cent of the vote.  A private poll conducted in bellwether sections of the state indicates that he is doing handsomely in all areas except in low income, non-Negro neighborhoods where there is some evidence of heavy \"white backlash\" sentiment.</span></p> <p><span>He will retain much of his old conservative support and in so doing will deliver a major set-back to Texas Republicans who had ironically based all their hopes on a ticket headed by Barry Goldwater.  And he will carry virtually all the liberals either because they have the high hope that he will be a great President, in the Roosevelt fashion, or because they recognize him as much the better of two evils.</span></p> <p><span>The year of pointed confusion for Texas that has followed the assassination of John Kennedy may well be succeeded by some bitter times for that province.  Either the conservatives or the liberals will have been wrong in supporting Lyndon Johnson.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Unusual Business | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>In his article on page three, Donald Graham reviews the events of the 1964 Democratic Convention and remarks, \"It was an unusual sight, but then it was an unusual year.\"  It has been a while since there has been a Presidential election year quite as unusual as the present one.</span></p> <p><span>Senator Goldwater's candidacy in itself has produced several rather unique situations.  Certainly it is the first time in a goodly number of years such an arch conservative has captured a party's presidential nomination and also taken over the party machinery itself.  Goldwater is, peculiarly, threatening to break up the Solid South for the first time in a hundred years against the first Southern president in the same period of time.</span></p> <p><span>This year's campaign has gotten underway in earnest far earlier than ones in the recent past have as if to confirm the unusual nature of this year's politics.  Graham notes the oddity of the 1964 Democratic convention.  Sanford Ungar also finds an air of the unnatural at the Republican convention, though produced by circumstances considerably different from those at Atlantic City.  Ungar notes the dilemma that Goldwater's nomination poses for liberal Republican candidates and analyzes the various pressures which must shape a politician's decision to support or repudiate the national ticket.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>Civil Rights</i></b></span></p> <p><span>Perhaps even more central to this unusual election year is the civil rights movement.  The dramatics of the Negro Revolution shifted back and forth from North to South during the summer; but as the conventions were called to order and adjourned and as the national election appraches, civil rights groups have turned their attention from demonstrations to politics.</span></p> <p><span>One of the most significant of these political civil rights groups to emerge over the summer is the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party.  Curtis Hessler worked on the initial political foray of the MFDP out of Mississippi in Washington and Atlantic City and found the party occasionally naive, often disorganized.  His careful analysis of the lobbying efforts of the FDP leading up to the convention is a remarkable story, one that could not have occured five years ago.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>Leadership Vacuum</i></b></span></p> <p><span>Nancy Moran views the MFDP in a distinctly more limited environment.  Her day by day account of the intense debate that occurred within the MFDP over the tactics to be employed at the Democratic convention reveals the virtual vacuum of leadership that seems to be developing within the Negro community.  By the end of the convention, the MFDP delegates had effectively rejected both the advice of the Northern leaders and the leaders themselves, Miss Moran notes, and she questions whether there is any effective Negro leadership at present.</span></p> <p><span>Patricia Hollander's photo essay and Peter Cummings' narrative present a fair picture of the Mississippi Summer Project.  Cummings plays down the heavily political orientation of the COFO voter registration efforts, pointing out that this occupied only a small portion of his day in Holly Springs, Mississippi.  Closer to home, the political activism of the Harvard Negro, and his increasing emotional allegiance to a form of black nationalism, is discussed by Harrison Young.</span></p>"}
{"title": "MFDP Ventures Out of Miss. | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>By the end of July, the Negro movement was stalled.  Overwhelming compliance with the Civil Rights Law had seemed to lift a moral burden from the nation's conscience.  The Goldwater Convention had stolen from the movement Morality, the American Heritage, the Constitution, and God.  And liberals were busily setting aside Baldwin's essays in order to ponder George Gallup's assessment of backlash.</span></p> <p><span>In late August, however, the movement reasserted itself.  Emerging from Mississippi, the Freedom Democratic Party (FDP) rocked the Democratic Convention, engaged the attention of a huge television audience, and reclicted from white liberals the phrases and fervor so quickly forgotten a short month earlier.</span></p> <p><span>Many histories of the FDP's convention challenge should be written.  The challenge should be was simultaneously a watershed in the history of Mississippi, a crisis-point in the history of the civil rights movement, and a significant footnote to the history of the Democratic Party.  However, as a white Northerner working sporadically for the FDP in Washington and Atlantic City, I could see the unfolding convention challenge only as a case study in political lobbying and public relations.</span></p> <p><span>Formally created on April 26, 1964 the Party began taking shape in June, with the influx of Freedom Summer volunteers.  At this stage many of the FDP's Northern friends worried at its sluggishness in building an active organization and constituency.  During one June visit to Washington Aaron Henry, NAACP chief in Mississippi and eventual spokesman for the Party, became angry with the impatience of his young Northern supporters:  \"All you consider is politics and this party thing.  We're handling a couple hundred community centers at once down there.  We'll cross the political bridge if and when we come to it.\"</span></p> <p><span>Obviously he viewed the Party as only one, fairly inconsequential, thread in the fabric of the Freedom Summer project.  This perspective, shared by most FDP leaders, inevitably inculcated in the Party the crusading zeal and moral absolutism of the Summer Project, qualities well suited to a social revolution, but rather awkward at a national political convention.</span></p> <p><span>By June it was clear that the Party was unable, or unwilling, to establish an orderly lobbying machinery in the North.  To Negroes, Frank Smith, an articulate and rather embittered young student, and Ella Baker, a portly veteran of the Southern Negro movement, traveled from state to state for the Party all summer, speaking to Democratic caucuses and committees wherever possible.  Between them they secured support pledges of varying intensity from eleven states.  But hurried schedules and limited energies permitted the two only to scratch the surface.</span></p> <p><span>For example, the Massachusetts party remained sympathetic, but uncommitted, to the Party right through the convention week.  Certainly LBJ's hostility to the FDP contributed to the ambivalence, but simple ignorance among Massachusetts delegates also played a part.  At any moment, the FDP could have mobilized Boston's many civil rights groups into a concerted lobbying organization.  But word never came from Jackson, and many Massachusetts delegates didn't learn the details of the issue until convention week, when hoopla and gossip precluded careful consideration of the question.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>Three Teams</i></b></span></p> <p><span>In Washington D.C. the lobbying situation was equally chaotic.  Congress remained in session nearly all summer, presenting District civil rights groups with an opportunity to convince, cajole, and inform hundreds of important Democrats.  At one point three independent teams of lobbyists were scouring the Hill for the FDP, but lack of coordination led to duplication of effort and endless embarrassment.  Without leadership from the Party, the activity was clearly futile, and eventually it disintegrated.</span></p> <p><span>In July the Party ceased ignoring its Northern backers and began counseling them to remain silent and inert.  Henceforth information about the Party was to come only from Jackson, and lobbyists were instructed to refer curious newsmen and delegates \"to the Mississippi office.\"  In view of the number of Northern delegates still to be won over, the directive seemed ludicrously impractical.  There were however several good reasons for it.</span></p> <p><span>Officially, Party leaders justified the directive by claiming concern that the press was beginning to view the FDP as a civil rights project based in New York or Washington rather than as a political movement indigenous to Mississippi.  There were also three unofficial, but more substantial, reasons for the directive.</span></p> <p><span>First, many Northern lobbyists had proven rather imaginative in describing the Party to delegates, at times hinting that the FDP group in Atlantic City would be 50% white.  Understandably, the Party wished to squelch such rumors at their source.  Second, the Goldwater nomination had impressed FDP leaders with the importance of a Democratic victory in November, and there was acute worry that overzealous lobbying might turn the \"Mississippi question\" into a wedge between quarelling party factions in key states like New York and California.</span></p> <p><span>More important than these two, however, was a third, less noble, reason for the directive; the suspicious, paranoic, militance which propelled the Party.  White allies, including Northern lobbyists, were viewed less as assets than as conspirators waiting to exploit the FDP for selfish ends.  The Party seemed to prefer testing its friends to using them constructively.</span></p> <p><span>In June Party leaders laid plans to train the Freedom delegation at the Highlander Folk Center in Nashville just prior to the National Convention.  When several sympathetic Northern politicians disapproved, citing the Communist connotations of the Center, a Party official snapped coldly, \"So you want us to yield to McCarthyism?\"</span></p> <p><span>The Party seemed more interested in ideological and moral purity than in political victory, and it was becoming increasingly clear that racial distrust and bureaucratic pettiness within the Party were making impossible an effective political effort on the national level.</span></p> <p><span>So Joseph Rauh quietly took over.  Vice-Chairman of ADA and leader of the Democratic Party in Washington, Rauh spent most of July preparing the FDP's legal case for the Credentials Committee.  With the approach of August, he also assumed responsibility for gathering Northern delegate strength.  It was a difficult task, since the President was actively working for the \"traditional\" delegation.</span></p> <p><span>Rauh began his campaign for support by sprucing up the FDP's image.  Seeking to eradicate the popular conception of the Party as a SNCCCORE enterprise, he requested active support from the NAACP and the National Council of Churches.  Clarence Mitchell, NAACP Washington representative, is a close friend of Rauh, and by early August Mitchell had pressed the Association into action:  Roy Wilkins pledged to endorse the Freedom delegation before the Platform and Credentials Committees.  Bishop Spike, of the National Council of Churches Commission on Race and Religion, also agreed to lend a hand behind the scenes.</span></p> <p><span>On 14 August, top religious and civil rights officials pleaded the Party's case at the White House.  They secured from the four LBJ aides assigned to the \"Mississippi question\" a shaky promise of Administration neutrality.  Johnson now realized that the FDP enjoyed fairly broad and prestigious support, that it could not be neatly swept under the rug.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>Johnson Sobered</i></b></span></p> <p><span>The events of 16 August further sobered the President, for that evening the California Democratic Executive Committee overwhelmingly accepted a pro-FDP resolution that was openly opposed by Governor Brown and the White House.  Thus, on the eve of the convention's first week, the Party's fortunes looked far brighter than anyone would have dared predict in June.</span></p> <p><span>Rauh was now on the phone 12 to 14 hours a day, cashing in on a life-time of political favors owed him in liberal circles.  As a UAW legal counsel, he enjoyed excellent relations with labor and soon secured formal endorsement from all UAW and IUE members who were Democratic delegates.  Even the officially non-partisan AFL-CIO lent moral support in the back room.</span></p> <p><span>Sensitive to party-wide anxiety over \"backlash,\" Rauh peddled the FDP as a liberal, not solely a civil rights, movement and dwelled on the corruption, disloyalty, and conservatism of the \"traditional\" delegation, playing only lightly on the discrimination issue.  The FDP, argued Rauh was a viable political alternative to the \"traditional\" party, not just an organized protest against the bigotry of the \"traditionals.\"</span></p> <p><span>While Rauh horsetraded deftly behind closed doors, the Party's Washington office stumbled through a convention-eve public relations campaign.  Foreseeing a listless convention, Party leaders had long realized that the \"Mississippi question\" would receive inordinate press coverage in late August.  Yet, inexplicably, the Party never developed an orderly publicity drive.</span></p> <p><span>By the beginning of platform hearings on August 17, news-starved reporters were bombarding the Washington FDP office for information. Each met with a reception one reporter termed \"curt, cold, and nasty:\"  \"The delegates will be here next weekend.  If you want more, call Jackson.\"</span></p> <p><span>Instead of calling Jackson, most newsmen understandably shrugged, swilled another scotch on the Democratic Party, and wandered off to interview the two \"traditional\" Mississippi delegates who wisely attended the platform hearings in order to snare important television time and newspaper space.</span></p> <p><span>On Tuesday, because of inadequate advance notice, the Washington FDP office released Rauh's legal brief to a half-attended conference.  When notified that some reporters hadn't seen the brief, the office manager snapped:  \"Well then let them come over and pick one up.\"  Harried newsmen, quartered in the Sheraton Park Hotel, found it difficult to travel cross town to the office, and as a result many never read the FDP's case.</span></p> <p><span>The Party's challenge strategy often appeared as confused as its public relations effort.  From the beginning of the summer, the FDP had refused to discuss compromise, at one time publicly castigating Senator Paul Douglas for proposing a 50-50 seating solution.  Before the convention such intransigence was essential to maintain a decent bargaining posture.  However, as the Credentials Committee continued negotiating and the FDP refused to yield, many of the Party's allies became uneasy.</span></p> <p><span>On Monday morning, August 24, Administration mediators offered the Party a \"fraternal delegation\" compromise, whereby \"traditionals\" who signed a loyalty oath would be seated in the Mississippi section, and the FDP would receive floor space with no voting rights.  Rauh turned the offer down and began gathering votes for a minority report and a floor fight.  His action alienated many wavering delegations.</span></p> <p><span>After hearing of the stalemate Monday afternoon, Vermont's Governor Hoff expressed to a group of FDP lobbyists the consensus of many Northern moderates:  \"Don't you recognize your responsibility to the Party and the country?  When you're up against a Goldwater, you sacrifice for party harmony or lose not only Mississippi but the nation, maybe the world.  I'm for you morally, but if you push this to the floor I'll vote against you.\"</span></p> <p><span>Late Monday night Roy Wilkins visited FDP spokesman Aaron Henry and urged him to back down.  Henry refused and the Party lost NAACP support.  Rauh and King continued to counsel firmness.  The wisdom of their resolve was proven Tuesday when the Administration offered a fresh compromise, giving the Freedom Party two at-large seats on the floor.  Under intense Presidential pressure, New York and California, the core of the FDP's support, agreed to the proposal.  In a hurried caucus of the Freedom delegation, Rauh and King urged the Party to accept the compromise and hail it as a great victory.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>No Moderate Control</i></b></span></p> <p><span>But the Party had long since slipped from the control of liberal politicians and moderate civil rights leaders.  On the boadwalk, the FDP's silent vigil had degenerated into a vitriolic anti-Johnson rally.  Jesse Grey, New York rent striker, milled through FDP headquarters at the Gem Hotel, calling for a last-ditch show of defiance.</span></p> <p><span>Indeed, with the last two days, the the Gem had become a general gathering point for discontents and militants of all hues, each long on advice and short on political experience.  It was in this atmosphere of ideological chaos, but not necessarily because of it, that the caucus rebuffed Rauh and King and drew up plans to enter the Mississippi seating area illegally.</span></p> <p><span>Commentators have interpreted the Party's decision in various ways.  Evans and Novak have intimated that extreme leftists were controlling the Party behind the scenes.  Others have blamed the Party's behavior on political naivete.  All the interpretations have assumed that the caucus' unwillingness to compromise proved that the Party couldn't fathom the Great American Art of Politics.  Perhaps this is a valid indictment, but it ignores the fact that the Party was trying to play not American politics, but Mississippi politics.  And, as every FDP pamphlet explains, \"Mississippi is like no where else on earth.\"</span></p> <p><span>The jostling in the aisle, the blind militance of the Mississippi \"seat-in,\" may have dismayed some Vermont politicians and the suburban television audience.  But there was another, a back audience crowded around television sets in a thousand grey shacks across rural Mississippi, watching intently as close friends and neighbors stood up to white authority--and got away with it.</span></p> <p><span>The whole credentials challenge was, after all, aimed at this audience, the true constituency of the Freedom Party.  Admittedly the challenge degenerated into an overly emotional protest against everything and thus, in a sense, against nothing.  But that is because protest is today the only realistic politics open to the Mississippi Negro</span></p>"}

The thirty-six hour bus trip from Jackson was the first time many of the delegates had been outside the borders of their native state.</i></span></p> <p><span><i>Washington attorney Joseph Rauh, Jr. Martin Luther King, Roy Wilkins, and James Farmer were also in Atlantic City that Friday.  All five northern civil rights leaders were working as advisors to Aaron Henry, chairman of the MFDP delegation, and Bob Moses, director of the COFO Summer Project.</i></span></p> <p><span><i>Hopes for the success of the convention challenge immediately united the delegation and its advisors.  But less than a week later the Mississippians had repudiated their Northern friends and the \"great victory\" the delegation had won.  By the end of the convention the leadership of the Freedom Party had polarized, split, and finally came under Moses' firm control.  The following is the story of how--and why--that split developed.</i></span></p> <p><span><i>Friday, August 21:</i>  Despite a State Court injunction barring their departure from Mississippi, the MFDP delegates arrive in Atlantic City.  Rauh, after telling the press, \"What a great sight it was to see that delegation getting off that bus,\" carefully outlines his strategy to the Freedom Democrats.  He will ask the Credentials Committee, of which he is a member, to give the Freedom Party at least equal treatment with the \"traditional\" party.</span></p> <p><span>If this fails, he will issue a minority report recommending that both delegations be seated and the vote split.  He will take this compromise before the convention for a floor fight.  He needs eleven Credentials Committee members to sign a minority report and eight state delegations to support a roll-call vote.</span></p> <p><span>The MFDP delegates are inspired by Rauh's \"nothing less than equality\" slogan.  \"All the Freedom Party needs,\" shouts Rauh from the street before the Gem, \"is the benevolent neutrality of the President in allowing the convention to decide the issue for itself.\"</span></p> <p><span>In Washington, Johnson seems far more concered with achieving harmony than allowing freedom of decision at the convention.  His strategy is to offer a compromise which will minimize the chance of a Southern walkout while maximizing liberal support in the coming election.  Above all, he wants to keep he fight off the floor.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>Moratorium Endangered</i></b></span></p> <p><span>Johnson has deployed Senators Hubert Humphrey and Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota, top contenders for the vice-presidential nomination, to assess Freedom Party support in the North and West.  He has already conferred with Wilkins and King, partners in the President's moratorium on demonstrations, and been told that if the Freedom delegation is not seated that moratorium may be impossible to enforce.</span></p> <p><span>Arriving in Atlantic City, Governor Carl Sanders announces that Georgia has given \"no serious thought\" to bolting the convention.  Only Louisiana looks likely to follow a Mississippi walk-out.</span></p> <p><span>The MFDP now intensifies its criticism of Johnson's obstinacy:  The states threatening to bolt the convention if the regular party is unseated are already lost to Goldwater.  And Johnson may lose the liberal vote if the MFDP is not seated.</span></p> <p><span>Friday afternoon the administration makes public what the MFDP immediately christens the \"Back-of-the-Bus\" Proposal: 1) seating as voting delegates those members of the traditional party who promise to support the national ticket; 2) seating the Freedom delegates as \"honored guests.\"</span></p> <p><span><b><i>Rauh Optimistic</i></b></span></p> <p><span>The Freedom Party caucuses in the Union Baptist Church.  The delegates vote unanimously to reject the compromise.  They insist the regular Mississippi delegation will use the loyalty oath as a superficial shield for its Goldwaterism.</span></p> <p><span>Rauh tells the delegation he is \"confident of having eleven or more people to sign a minority report if one is necessary.\"  He concludes with an appeal to the press to demand that the Credentials Committee hearings be moved from is present room--too small to allow news coverage--to the ballroom in Convention Hall.  Rauh is trying to foil Johnson's efforts to smother the challenge.</span></p> <p><span>The delegation is completely open to Rauh's suggestions.  His optimism is infectious.  Moreover, the Mississippians, accustomed to suffering for their cause, are sympathetic to Rauh's fight against administrative pressure.</span></p> <p><span>Until now there has been no necessity for the delegation to make any difficult decisions.  Thus no real leader has emerged.  The delegates are following Rauh through the legal technicalities of the challenge.  Henry, as chairman, has the job of keeping order in the delegation.  He is not expected to make decisions.</span></p> <p><span><i>Saturday August 22:</i>  Rauh wins his first battle:  The Credentials Committee hearings are moved to the ballroom.  The Freedom delegates, after lining up outside Convention Hall and singing freedom songs before a crowd of 500 puzzled on-lookers, are permitted to enter the hearings.  Henry, wearing a large LBJ button, repeatedly tells the press, \"Even if we lose, we are going back to Mississippi to work for Johnson.\"</span></p> <p><span>This is the first time the MFDP has appealed its case outside Mississippi.  Now Rauh brings the challenge before a nation-wide television audience.  He relies primarily on Henry and Mrs.  Fanny Lou Hamer's tales of persecution to show that the MFDP is the \"loyal, legal, and long-suffering party from Mississippi.\"  To charges that the Party has no legal basis, Rauh replies:  \"The Negro has been kept out of the Mississippi Democratic Party by terror.  I want the nation to know this terror.\"</span></p> <p><span>That night Wilkins, King, Rauh, Moses, and Henry meet with sympathetic members of the Credentials Committee in the delegates' lounge behind the ballroom.  After the highly emotional afternoon session, many Committee members are demanding that the traditional party be thrown out and the MFDP seated.  Rauh argues that this is politically unsound.  But he accepts a proposal by Rep.  Edith Green of Oregon that the minority report specify that a loyalty oath be administered to both delegations.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>Switch in Tactics</i></b></span></p> <p><span>Rauh has switched his tactics.  Convinced that the administration will not offer a new compromise, he is underplaying the legal argument and making a moral appeal for mass support in a floor fight.</span></p> <p><span><i>Sunday, August 23:</i>  This is a day of background activity.  The Credentials Committee reaches agreement on the Alabama seating dispute but postpones consideration of the Mississippi question until Monday.</span></p> <p><span>The District of Columbia, New York, California, Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Massachusetts, Oregon, Colorado, Guam, and the Virgin Islands have promised they will ask for a roll-call.  But pressure from the administration is increasing hourly, and the support of the smaller states and the territories must be considered uncertain.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>Police Unobtrusive</i></b></span></p> <p><span>Martin Luther King addresses the delegates Sunday evening at the church.  \"It is better to take a great moral stand, which in the final analysis will prove politically sound,\" he tells the group.</span></p> <p><span><i>Monday, August 24:</i>  At midnight a group of 100 students marches to the Boardwalk to begin a 98-hour silent vigil before Convention Hall.  One Bible-reading delegate from Arizona joins.  To the surprise of the students, many recently returned from Mississippi, the police are unobtrusive.</span></p> <p><span>The Credentials Committee meets in the afternoon, adjourning at 6 p.m. to announce it is still deadlocked.  But the MFDP's legal position is weakening, for the Credentials Committee has decided that a legal party is one which has complied with the law of the state from which it comes.  Still, the Freedom delegation has attracted a hard core of supporters, who are determined to bring the issue to the floor if the administration refuses to change its position.</span></p> <p><span>Monday night the Freedom delegates attend the convention session as guests.  They behave like normal delegates--becoming bored and leaving early.  A single Freedom delegate reaches the floor and spends the evening in the empty Mississippi seats.  \"No one,\" he explains, \"even noticed.\"</span></p> <p><span>Reports from Rauh indicate that the deliberations are becoming increasingly bitter.  Henry expresses the growing tedium--and helplessness--of the delegates:  \"We don't know how to deal with a mind like Johnson's.  He is playing a kind of ego, self-preservation politics that folks like us don't understand.\"</span></p> <p><span><i>Tuesday, August 25:</i>  Through the night, Rauh confers with Humphrey.  Rauh later tells the delegates that three people have argued with Johnson--one as recently as 6 a.m.--but that the President will not change his stand.  Humphrey indicates that if the compromise fails and a floor fight ensues he will lose the vice-presidency.</span></p> <p><span>At 11 a.m., Rauh, exhausted from the all-night session, appears at the church.  The delegates listen silently as he describes the \"excruciating pressure\" applied to the Credentials Committee:  One woman's husband has been threatened with the loss of a judgeship; another member has been pressured by the Secretary of the Army.</span></p> <p><span>Moses rises from the back of the church.  He states that he believes the administration will try and trap the MFDP by offering a new compromise.  \"They promised,\" continues Moses, \"to abolish segregation in Mississippi politics.  I asked Humphrey if that meant the federal government would aid in voter registration.  'Those are two seperate matters,' he replied.\"</span></p> <p><span>Rauh replies that Johnson \"won't budge.\"  He is certain there will be no new compromise.  Moses speaks of the rumor that the Credentials Committee may adjourn without making a report.</span></p> <p><span>Rauh retorts that he will defeat the motion to adjourn by forming \"a coalition with the South to force the Committee to report.\"  Rauh's strategy still centers about the floor fight he believes is inevitable.</span></p> <p><span>Moses finishes by asking the delegation to accept the Green proposal as their minimal demand.  The delegates respond with a unanimous \"aye.\"</span></p> <p><span>At 3 p.m. Walter Reuther informs Rauh of the new administration proposal--the plan eventually approved by the convention.  The traditional party will be seated after signing a loyalty oath; 1968 convention rules will prohibit segregation in Democratic Party affairs; Edwin King and Aaron Henry will be seated as delegates at large with a vote apiece.  Humphrey confers with Henry and King.  Moses asks for time to discuss the compromise with the delegation.  His request is refused.</span></p> <p><span>At 5 p.m. Rauh returns to the church to ask the delegation to approve the compromise.  Moses interruts to remind the delegates that they have already voted to reject the compromise.  The delegation cheers him.</span></p> <p><span>Martin Luther King and Ella Baker, MFDP Washington staff member, clash violently over the issue.  The delegation must accept the compromise, says King, to lessen \"the long suffering and deep-seated frustration of the Negro people.\"  \"We must reject it,\" says Miss Baker, \"to condemn the massive political pressure exerted by the administration.\"</span></p> <p><span>That night, Freedom delegates wearing borrowed credentials enter the covention by \"Underground Railway\"--once they reach the Mississippi sector, they remove the badges, which are then taken outside and used to bring in more delegtes.  A crush of reporters keep the sargeants-at-arms away.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>\"Fair and Square\"</i></b></span></p> <p><span>Only Moses periodically penetrates the mass, leading two or three more delegates to the Mississippi seats.  Henry sits in the center.  \"They wanted to seat us at large,\" he explains to the reporters mobbing him, \"but we wanted our seats in Mississippi.  We don't see why its so exciting.\"</span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile, most members of the Credentials Committee express approval of the President's compromise.  Support for a minority report immediately slips from eighteen to four.  Rauh maintains that the compromise is \"fair and square;\" he has, however, lost the trust of the Freedom Party.  Many staff members unfairly charge King with having convinced the Credentials Committee not to issue a minority report.</span></p> <p><span><i>Wednesday, August 26:</i>  Henry attempts to get the delegates to reconsider the compromise.  They refuse to take a new vote; but they agree to listen to the leaders of \"groups whose help we've been forced to depend on.\"</span></p> <p><span>Bayard Rustin discusses the political attitude of the Negro.  We are \"moving from an early protest movement into the political structure,\" he begins.  \"A protest movement requires an attitude of suffering, of absolutism, of vindication.  A political movement requires compromise.  Mississippi has showed you that political action is what we need.  We should have sent the dixiecrats home and stayed and voted.\"</span></p> <p><span>Of the Convention Hall sit-in, he reflects that such attention-getting devices are becoming obsolete.  \"Do not make the mistake of applying a demonstration philosophy to a political structure.\"</span></p> <p><span>King then cautions that \"nothing could be more dishonest than to overestimate -- or underestimate -- what has been done.  The problem is giving the people a deep-seated sense of what has been accomplished.\"</span></p> <p><span>Three weeks ago, King continues, \"Johnson had no intention of recognizing the MFDP....You have immobilized the political machinery of the nation.  Yoy have caused the Democratic Party to purge itself.\"</span></p> <p><span><b><i>Morally Right</i></b></span></p> <p><span>Oregon's Senator Wayne Morse argues for the compromise:  \"Rauh's witnesses shook my colleagues....I am sorry the issue couldn't be brought to the floor...If tonight, for the first time, two Negroes cast votes, that will be tremendous progress.\"</span></p> <p><span>James Farmer tells the delegates:  \"You were politically wrong, but morally right.  If your decision remains firm, you are choosing not to join the Democratic Party.\"</span></p> <p><span>Moses rebuts them all:  \"I think that you are not responsible for this country--its the people running the country that are responsible.  All you can know is the hell hole you came from.  It is not up to you to make political decisions.</span></p> <p><span>\"Last night's demonstration was a creative decision in the sense that it brought the delegation and the COFO workers out of their deep dispair.  The whole purpose of the Freedom Party is to get the vote.  We have the right to dramatize the fact that we have seats without a vote.\"</span></p> <p><span>That evening the MFDP delegates again enter the convention hall.  The Mississippi seats have been removed.  The Freedom delegates stand in the empty space.</span></p> <p><span>That morning ACT agreed to cancel its proposed stall-in at Atlantic City if the MFDP continues its sit-in.  It is uncertain how much ACT's announcement influenced Moses' decision to return to the convention floor.</span></p> <p><span>Once the Freedom delegates had entered the convention hall Wednesday night, they could not reconsider the compromise.  King attempted to persuade Moses to reconsider his position by telling him that Humphrey promised co-operation with civil rights leaders for the next four years if the compromise was accepted.  \"We must be both militant and moderate,\" said King.  Replied Moses:  \"Humphrey and McCarthy haven't been our allies.  We need to build a fire under their feet.\"</span></p> <p><span>* * *</span></p> <p><span>Moses' contempt for tokenism was central to the MFDP's rejection of the compromise.  Moses contends:  \"We are not here to bring politics into civil rights.  We are here to bring civil rights into politics.\"</span></p> <p><span>The MFDP won a compromise which indicates a turning point in the Democratic Party, which traditionally has been profoundly influenced by lilly-white Southern delegations.  Why did the delegation still feel morally incapable of agreeing to the compromise?</span></p> <p><span>Rauh's optimism may have been at fault.  He should have prepared the delegates for a compromise.  But Rauh is a natural optimist.  It is probable that the delegates misinterpreted his personality.</span></p> <p><span>The rejection of the compromise was also a rejection of President Johnson.  The delegates now view him as a Southerner opposed to progress in civil rights.  In his handling of the challange, they charge, he subordinated Negro interests to his use of the convention as a show of great political unity.</span></p> <p><span>Moses, a man of uncompromising morality, imposed his own standards on the delegation during the convention.  But Moses, a humble and selfless man, stepped into the leadership role because the Party was floundering.  He may step out as the Party gains strength.</span></p> <p><span>Three alternatives are now open to the MFDP.  It can remain a small, isolated Mississippi protest group.  It can form branches in other states to make a strong Negro voting bloc.  Or it can follow its original aim of workin within the structure of the Democratic Party.  If it tries to work in the Democratic Party, it may have to realize that a compromise is not necessarily based on betrayal, cowardice, and ignorance, that it is often a part of the process of two strong groups vying for power.  Without using the weapon of compromise, the MFDP may remain powerless</span></p>"}

Moses speaks of the rumor that the Credentials Committee may adjourn without making a report.</span></p> <p><span>Rauh retorts that he will defeat the motion to adjourn by forming \"a coalition with the South to force the Committee to report.\"  Rauh's strategy still centers about the floor fight he believes is inevitable.</span></p> <p><span>Moses finishes by asking the delegation to accept the Green proposal as their minimal demand.  The delegates respond with a unanimous \"aye.\"</span></p> <p><span>At 3 p.m. Walter Reuther informs Rauh of the new administration proposal--the plan eventually approved by the convention.  The traditional party will be seated after signing a loyalty oath; 1968 convention rules will prohibit segregation in Democratic Party affairs; Edwin King and Aaron Henry will be seated as delegates at large with a vote apiece.  Humphrey confers with Henry and King.  Moses asks for time to discuss the compromise with the delegation.  His request is refused.</span></p> <p><span>At 5 p.m. Rauh returns to the church to ask the delegation to approve the compromise.  Moses interruts to remind the delegates that they have already voted to reject the compromise.  The delegation cheers him.</span></p> <p><span>Martin Luther Kind and Ella Baker, MFDP Washington staff member, clash violently over the issue.  The delegation must accept the compromise, says King, to lessen \"the long suffering and deep-seated frustration of the Negro people.\"  \"We must reject it,\" says Miss Baker, \"to condemn the massive political pressure exerted by the administration.\"</span></p> <p><span>That night, Freedom delegates wearing borrowed credentials enter the convention by \"Underground Railway\"--once they reach the Mississippi sector, they remove the badges, which are then taken outside and used to bring in more delegates.  A crush of reporters keep the sargeants-at-arms away.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>\"Fair and Square\"</i></b></span></p> <p><span>Only Moses periodically penetrates the mass, leading two or three more delegates to the Mississippi seats.  Henry sits in the center.  \"They wanted to seat us at large,\" he explains to the reporters mobbing him, \"but we wanted our seats in Mississippi.  We don't see why its so exciting.\"</span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile, most members of the Credentials Committee express approval of the President's compromise.  Support for a minority report immediately slips from eighteen to four.  Rauh maintains that the compromise is \"fair and square;\" he has, however, lost the trust of the Freedom Party.  Many staff members unfairly charge King with having convinced the Credentials Committee not to issue a minority report.</span></p> <p><span><i>Wednesday, August 26:</i>  Henry attempts to get the delegates to reconsider the compromise.  They refuse to take a new vote; but they agree to listen to the leaders of \"groups whose help we've been forced to depend on.\"</span></p> <p><span>Bayard Rustin discusses the political attitude of the Negro.  We are \"moving from an early protest movement into the political structure,\" he begins.  \"A protest movement requires an attitude of suffering, of absolutism, of vindication.  A political movement requires compromise.  Mississippi has showed you that political action is what we need.  We should have sent the dixiecrats home and stayed and voted.\"</span></p> <p><span>Of the Convention Hall sit-in, he reflects that such attention-getting devices are becoming obsolete.  \"Do not make the mistake of applying a demonstration philosophy to a political structure.\"</span></p> <p><span>King then cautions that \"nothing could be more dishonest than to overestimate -- or underestimate -- what has been done.  The problem is giving the people a deep-seated sense of what has been accomplished.\"</span></p> <p><span>Three weeks ago, King continues, \"Johnson had no intention of recognizing the MFDP. . . .You have immobilized the political machinery of the nation.  You have caused the Democratic Party to purge itself.\"</span></p> <p><span><b><i>Morally Right</i></b></span></p> <p><span>Oregon's Senator Wayne Morse argues for the compromise:  \"Rauh's witnesses shook my colleagues. . . . I am sorry the issue couldn't be brought to the floor. . .If tonight, for the first time, two Negroes cast votes, that will be tremendous progress.\"</span></p> <p><span>James Farmer tells the delegates:  \"You were politically wrong, but morally right.  If your decision remains firm, you are choosing not to join the Democratic Party.\"</span></p> <p><span>Moses rebuts them all:  \"I think that you are not responsible for this country--its the people running the country that are responsible.  All you can know is the hell hole you came from.  It is not up to you to make political decisions.</span></p> <p><span>\"Last night's demonstration was a creative decision in the sense that it brought the delegation and the COFO workers out of their deep dispair.  The whole purpose of the Freedom Party is to get the vote.  We have the right to dramatize the fact that we have seats without a vote.\"</span></p> <p><span>That evening the MFDP delegates again enter the convention hall.  The Mississippi seats have been removed.  The Freedom delegates stand in the empty space.</span></p> <p><span>That morning ACT agreed to cancel its proposed stall-in at Atlantic City if the MFDP continues its sit-in.  It is uncertain how much ACT's announcement influenced Moses' decision to return to the convention floor.</span></p> <p><span>Once the Freedom delegates had entered the convention hall Wednesday night, they could not reconsider the compromise.  King attempted to persuade Moses to reconsider his position by telling him that Humphrey promised co-operation with civil rights leaders for the next four years if the compromise was accepted.  \"We must be both militant and moderate,\" said King.  Replied Moses:  \"Humphrey and McCarthy haven't been our allies.  We need to build a fire under their feet.\"</span></p> <p><span>* * *</span></p> <p><span>Moses' contempt for tokenism was central to the MFDP's rejection of the compromise.  Moses contends:  \"We are not here to bring politics into civil rights.  We are here to bring civil rights into politics.\"</span></p> <p><span>The MFDP won a compromise which indicates a turning point in the Democratic Party, which traditionally has been profoundly influenced by lilly-white Southern delegations.  Why did the delegation still feel morally incapable of agreeing to the compromise?</span></p> <p><span>Rauh's optimism may have been at fault.  He should have prepared the delegates for a compromise.  But Rauh is a natural optimist.  It is probable that the delegates misinterpreted his personality.</span></p> <p><span>The rejection of the compromise was also a rejection of President Johnson.  The delegates now view him as a Southerner opposed to progress in civil rights.  In his handling of the challenge, they charge, he subordinated Negro interests to his use of the convention as a show of great political unity.</span></p> <p><span>Moses, a man of uncompromising morality, imposed his own standards on the delegation during the convention.  But Moses, a humble and selfless man, stepped into the leadership role because the Party was floundering.  He may step out as the Party gains strength.</span></p> <p><span>Three alternatives are now open to the MFDP.  It can remain a small, isolated Mississippi protest group.  It can form branches in other states to make a strong Negro voting bloc.  Or it can follow its original aim of work in within the structure of the Democratic Party.  If it tries to work in the Democratic Party, it may have to realize that a compromise is not necessarily based on betrayal, cowardice, and ignorance, that it is often a part of the process of two strong groups vying for power.  Without using the weapon of compromise, the MFDP may remain powerless</span></p>"}
{"title": "MFDP Ventures Out of Miss. | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>By the end of July, the Negro movement was stalled.  Overwhelming compliance with the Civil Rights Law had seemed to lift a moral burden from the nation's conscience.  The Goldwater Convention had stolen from the movement Morality, the American Heritage, the Constitution, and God.  And liberals were busily setting aside Baldwin's essays in order to ponder George Gallup's assessment of backlash.</span></p> <p><span>In late August, however, the movement reasserted itself.  Emerging from Mississippi, the Freedom Democratic Party (FDP) rocked the Democratic Convention, engaged the attention of a huge television audience, and reelicted from white liberals the phrases and fervor so quickly forgotten a short month earlier.</span></p> <p><span>Many histories of the FDP's convention challenge should be written.  The challenge was simultaneously a watershed in the history of Mississippi, a crisis-point in the history of the civil rights movement, and a significant footnote to the history of the Democratic Party.  However, as a white Northerner working sporadically for the FDP in Washington and Atlantic City, I could see the unfolding convention challenge only as a case study in political lobbying and public relations.</span></p> <p><span>Formally created on April 26, 1964 the Party began taking shape in June, with the influx of Freedom Summer volunteers.  At this stage many of the FDP's Northern friends worried at its sluggishness in building an active organization and constituency.  During one June visit to Washington Aaron Henry, NAACP chief in Mississippi and eventual spokesman for the Party, became angry with the impatience of his young Northern supporters:  \"All you consider is politics and this party thing.  We're handling a couple hundred community centers at once down there.  We'll cross the political bridge if and when we come to it.\"</span></p> <p><span>Obviously he viewed the Party as only one, fairly inconsequential, thread in the fabric of the Freedom Summer project.  This perspective, shared by most FDP leaders, inevitably inculcated in the Party the crusading zeal and moral absolutism of the Summer Project, qualities well suited to a social revolution, but rather awkward at a national political convention.</span></p> <p><span>By June it was clear that the Party was unable, or unwilling, to establish an orderly lobbying machinery in the North.  To Negroes, Frank Smith, an articulate and rather embittered young student, and Ella Baker, a portly veteran of the Southern Negro movement, traveled from state to state for the Party all summer, speaking to Democratic caucuses and committees wherever possible.  Between them they secured support pledges of varying intensity from eleven states.  But hurried schedules and limited energies permitted the two only to scratch the surface.</span></p> <p><span>For example, the Massachusetts party remained sympathetic, but uncommitted, to the Party right through the convention week.  Certainly LBJ's hostility to the FDP contributed to the ambivalence, but simple ignorance among Massachusetts delegates also played a part.  At any moment, the FDP could have mobilized Boston's many civil rights groups into a concerted lobbying organization.  But word never came from Jackson, and many Massachusetts delegates didn't learn the details of the issue until convention week, when hoopla and gossip precluded careful consideration of the question.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>Three Teams</i></b></span></p> <p><span>In Washington D.C. the lobbying situation was equally chaotic.  Congress remained in session nearly all summer, presenting District civil rights groups with an opportunity to convince, cajole, and inform hundreds of important Democrats.  At one point three independent teams of lobbyists were scouring the Hill for the FDP, but lack of coordination led to duplication of effort and endless embarrassment.  Without leadership from the Party, the activity was clearly futile, and eventually it disintegrated.</span></p> <p><span>In July the Party ceased ignoring its Northern backers and began counseling them to remain silent and inert.  Henceforth information about the Party was to come only from Jackson, and lobbyists were instructed to refer curious newsmen and delegates \"to the Mississippi office.\"  In view of the number of Northern delegates still to be won over, the directive seemed ludicrously impractical.  There were however several good reasons for it.</span></p> <p><span>Officially, Party leaders justified the directive by claiming concern that the press was beginning to view the FDP as a civil rights project based in New York or Washington rather than as a political movement indigenous to Mississippi.  There were also three unofficial, but more substantial, reasons for the directive.</span></p> <p><span>First, many Northern lobbyists had proven rather imaginative in describing the Party to delegates, at times hinting that the FDP group in Atlantic City would be 50% white.  Understandably, the Party wished to squelch such rumors at their source.  Second, the Goldwater nomination had impressed FDP leaders with the importance of a Democratic victory in November, and there was acute worry that overzealous lobbying might turn the \"Mississippi question\" into a wedge between quarelling party factions in key states like New York and California.</span></p> <p><span>More important than these two, however, was a third, less noble, reason for the directive; the suspicious, paranoic, militance which propelled the Party.  White allies, including Northern lobbyists, were viewed less as assets than as conspirators waiting to exploit the FDP for selfish ends.  The Party seemed to prefer testing its friends to using them constructively.</span></p> <p><span>In June Party leaders laid plans to train the Freedom delegation at the Highlander Folk Center in Nashville just prior to the National Convention.  When several sympathetic Northern politicians disapproved, citing the Communist connotations of the Center, a Party official snapped coldly, \"So you want us to yield to McCarthyism?\"</span></p> <p><span>The Party seemed more interested in ideological and moral purity than in political victory, and it was becoming increasingly clear that racial distrust and bureaucratic pettiness within the Party were making impossible an effective political effort on the national level.</span></p> <p><span>So Joseph Rauh quietly took over.  Vice-Chairman of ADA and leader of the Democratic Party in Washington, Rauh spent most of July preparing the FDP's legal case for the Credentials Committee.  With the approach of August, he also assumed responsibility for gathering Northern delegate strength.  It was a difficult task, since the President was actively working for the \"traditional\" delegation.</span></p> <p><span>Rauh began his campaign for support by sprucing up the FDP's image.  Seeking to eradicate the popular conception of the Party as a SNCC-CORE enterprise, he requested active support from the NAACP and the National Council of Churches.  Clarence Mitchell, NAACP Washington representative, is a close friend of Rauh, and by early August Mitchell had pressed the Association into action:  Roy Wilkins pledged to endorse the Freedom delegation before the Platform and Credentials Committees.  Bishop Spike, of the National Council of Churches Commission on Race and Religion, also agreed to lend a hand behind the scenes.</span></p> <p><span>On 14 August, top religious and civil rights officials pleaded the Party's case at the White House.  They secured from the four LBJ aides assigned to the \"Mississippi question\" a shaky promise of Administration neutrality.  Johnson now realized that the FDP enjoyed fairly broad and prestigious support, that it could not be neatly swept under the rug.</span></p> <p><span><b>Johnson Sobered</b></span></p> <p><span>The events of 16 August further sobered the President, for that evening the California Democratic Executive Committee overwhelmingly accepted a pro-FDP resolution that was openly opposed by Governor Brown and the White House.  Thus, on the eve of the convention's first week, the Party's fortunes looked far brighter than anyone would have dared predict in June.</span></p> <p><span>Rauh was now on the phone 12 to 14 hours a day, cashing in on a life-time of political favors owed him in liberal circles.  As a UAW legal counsel, he enjoyed excellent relations with labor and soon secured formal endorsement from all UAW and IUE members who were Democratic delegates.  Even the officially non-partisan AFL-CIO lent moral support in the back room.</span></p> <p><span>Sensitive to party-wide anxiety over \"backlash,\" Rauh peddled the FDP as a liberal, not solely a civil rights, movement and dwelled on the corruption, disloyalty, and conservatism of the \"traditional\" delegation, playing only lightly on the discrimination issue.  The FDP, argued Rauh was a viable political alternative to the \"traditional\" party, not just an organized protest against the bigotry of the \"traditional.\"</span></p> <p><span>While Rauh horsetraded deftly behind closed doors, the Party's Washington office stumbled through a convention-eve public relations campaign.  Foreseeing a listless convention, Party leaders had long realized that the \"Mississippi question\" would receive inordinate press coverage in late August.  Yet, inexplicably, the Party never developed an orderly publicity drive.</span></p> <p><span>By the beginning of platform hearings on August 17, news-starved reporters were bombarding the Washington FDP office for information. Each met with a reception one reporter termed \"curt, cold, and nasty:\"  \"The delegates will be here next weekend.  If you want more, call Jackson.\"</span></p> <p><span>Instead of calling Jackson, most newsmen understandably shrugged, swilled another scotch on the Democratic Party, and wandered off to interview the two \"traditional\" Mississippi delegates who wisely attended the platform hearings in order to snare important television time and newspaper space.</span></p> <p><span>On Tuesday, because of inadequate advance notice, the Washington FDP office released Rauh's legal brief to a half-attended conference.  When notified that some reporters hadn't seen the brief, the office manager snapped:  \"Well then let them come over and pick one up.\"  Harried newsmen, quartered in the Sheraton Park Hotel, found it difficult to travel cross town to the office, and as a result many never read the FDP's case.</span></p> <p><span>The Party's challenge strategy often appeared as confused as its public relations effort.  From the beginning of the summer, the FDP had refused to discuss compromise, at one time publicly castigating Senator Paul Douglas for proposing a 50-50 seating solution.  Before the convention such intransigence was essential to maintain a decent bargaining posture.  However, as the Credentials Committee continued negotiating and the FDP refused to yield, many of the Party's allies became uneasy.</span></p> <p><span>On Monday morning, August 24, Administration mediators offered the Party a \"fraternal delegation\" compromise, whereby \"traditionals\" who signed a loyalty oath would be seated in the Mississippi section, and the FDP would receive floor space with no voting rights.  Rauh turned the offer down and began gathering votes, for a minority report and a floor fight.  His action alienated many wavering delegations.</span></p> <p><span>After hearing of the stalemate Monday afternoon, Vermont's Governor Hoff expressed to a group of FDP lobbyists the consensus of many Northern moderates:  \"Don't you recognize your responsibility to the Party and the country?  When you're up against a Goldwater, you sacrifice for party harmony or lose not only Mississippi but the nation, maybe the world.  I'm for you morally, but if you push this to the floor I'll vote against you.\"</span></p> <p><span>Late Monday night Roy Wilkins visited FDP spokesman Aaron Henry and urged him to back down.  Henry refused and the Party lost NAACP support.  Rauh and King continued to counsel firmness.  The wisdom of their resolve was proven Tuesday when the Administration offered a fresh compromise, giving the Freedom Party two at-large seats on the floor.  Under intense Presidential pressure, New York and California, the core of the FDP's support, agreed to the proposal.  In a hurried caucus of the Freedom delegation, Rauh and King urged the Party to accept the compromise and hail it as a great victory.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>No Moderate Control</i></b></span></p> <p><span>But the Party had long since slipped from the control of liberal politicians and moderate civil rights leaders.  On the boadwalk, the FDP's silent vigil had degenerated into a vitriolic anti-Johnson rally.  Jesse Grey, New York rent striker, milled through FDP headquarters at the Gem Hotel, calling for a last-ditch show of defiance.</span></p> <p><span>Indeed, with the last two days, the the Gem had become a general gathering point for discontents and militants of all hues, each long on advice and short on political experience.  It was in this atmosphere of ideological chaos, but not necessarily because of it, that the caucus rebuffed Rauh and King and drew up plans to enter the Mississippi seating area illegally.</span></p> <p><span>Commentators have interpreted the Party's decision in various ways.  Evans and Novak have intimated that extreme leftists were controlling the Party behind the scenes.  Others have blamed the Party's behavior on political naivete.  All the interpretations have assumed that the caucus' unwillingness to compromise proved that the Party couldn't fathom the Great American Art of Politics.  Perhaps this is a valid indictment, but it ignores the fact that the Party was trying to play not American politics, but Mississippi politics.  And, as every FDP pamphlet explains, \"Mississippi is like no where else on earth.\"</span></p> <p><span>The jostling in the aisle, the blind militance of the Mississippi \"seat-in,\" may have dismayed some Vermont politicians and the suburban television audience.  But there was another, a back audience crowded around television sets in a thousand grey shacks across rural Mississippi, watching intently as close friends and neighbors stood up to white authority--and got away with it.</span></p> <p><span>The whole credentials challenge was, after all, aimed at this audience, the true constituency of the Freedom Party.  Admittedly the challenge degenerated into an overly emotional protest against everything and thus, in a sense, against nothing.  But that is because protest is today the only realistic politics open to the Mississippi Negro</span></p>"}

Certainly it is the first time in a goodly number of years such an arch conservative has captured a party's presidential nomination and also taken over the party machinery itself.  Goldwater is, peculiarly, threatening to break up the Solid South for the first time in a hundred years against the first Southern president in the same period of time.</span></p> <p><span>This year's campaign has gotten underway in earnest far earlier than ones in the recent past have as if to confirm the unusual nature of this year's politics.  Graham notes the oddity of the 1964 Democratic convention.  Sanford Ungar also finds an air of the unnatural at the Republican convention, though produced by circumstances considerably different from those at Atlantic City.  Ungar notes the dilemma that Goldwater's nomination poses for liberal Republican candidates and analyzes the various pressures which must shape a politician's decision to support or repudiate the national ticket.</span></p> <p><span><b>Civil Rights</b></span></p> <p><span>Perhaps even more central to this unusual election year is the civil rights movement.  The dramatics of the Negro Revolution shifted back and forth from North to South during the summer; but as the conventions were called to order and adjourned and as the national election appraches, civil rights groups have turned their attention from demonstrations to politics.</span></p> <p><span>One of the most significant of these political civil rights groups to emerge over the summer is the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party.  Curtis Hessler worked on the initial political foray of the MFDP out of Mississippi in Washington and Atlantic City and found the party occasionally naive, often disorganized.  His careful analysis of the lobbying efforts of the FDP leading up to the convention is a remarkable story, one that could not have occured five years ago.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>Leadership Vacuum</i></b></span></p> <p><span>Nancy Moran views the MFDP in a distinctly more limited environment.  Her day by day account of the intense debate that occurred within the MFDP over the tactics to be employed at the Democratic convention reveals the virtual vacuum of leadership that seems to be developing within the Negro community.  By the end of the convention, the MFDP delegates had effectively rejected both the advice of the Northern leaders and the leaders themselves, Miss Moran notes, and she questions whether there is any effective Negro leadership at present.</span></p> <p><span>Patricia Hollander's photo essay and Peter Cummings' narrative present a fair picture of the Mississippi Summer Project.  Cummings plays down the heavily political orientation of the COFO voter registration efforts, pointing out that this occupied only a small portion of his day in Holly Springs, Mississippi.  Closer to home, the political activism of the Harvard Negro, and his increasing emotional allegiance to a form of black nationalism, is discussed by Harrison Young.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Texas in State of Confusion Since Assassination; Johnson Supported By Both Liberals, Conservatives | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>In the year since his succession to the Presidency, Lyndon Johnson has so ingeniously manipulated national politics that he currently enjoys an endorsement he hopes may bring a return to the Era of Good Feeling.  In his native Texas, he enjoys the same widely divergent support that he does on a national scale but there it has created more chaos than good feeling.  The warring elements of the Democratic Party, the liberals and conservatives, have rarely been so confused.</span></p> <p><span>Johnson inherited from Kennedy not only the White House but a liberal program and the leadership of a liberal party.  In Texas, President Johnson--like Vice-President Johnson and Senator Johnson before him--was master of the conservative wing of that party; his friends were conservatives, his benefactors were conservatives, his patronage went to conservatives.</span></p> <p><span>His voting record in the Senate had always been relatively liberal and his sentiment on national issues was the same, but at home he was an undoubted conservative.  He protected the oil depletion allowance more assiduously than he ever espoused liberal ideas and the political machinery he had masterfully welded had few elements that were not right of center.</span></p> <p><span>The liberal wing was led by Senator Ralph Yarborough and the animosity between Johnson and Yarborough was both deep and dramatic.  It was during President Kennedy's trip to Texas, in fact, that this rivalry reached some of its most heated moments.  There was substantial fear among the liberals that the money being raised by the chief political event on the President's schedule, a $100 a plate dinner to be held November 23rd, would be used by the conservatives to unseat Yarborough and keep liberals out of state offices.  The Senator had even refused to ride in the same car with the Vice-President until Kennedy ordered him to do so in Dallas.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>Situation Confused</i></b></span></p> <p><span>But when Lyndon Johnson was elevated to the Presidency the situation in Texas was clouded.  As it became clear that Johnson would carry on the Kennedy program and, indeed, enlarge upon it and get it passed, most of the liberals of Texas found themselves supporting the man they had so often opposed.</span></p> <p><span>Within the state, however, Johnson's conservative associates were doing business as usual.  John Connally, as Governor, was the ranking member of the state party and also headed its conservative element.  Although he served for a short time as Secretary of the Navy in the Kennedy government, his campaign for Governor had been based on an essentially anti-Kennedy platform; he was opposed to the civil rights bill, to Medicare, and to many other key points in the New Frontier.</span></p> <p><span>At the same time he was one of Johnson's oldest and closest allies.  \"I love him like a brother,\" Johnson once said, \"I love him more than I do Sam Houston.\"  Like Johnson, Connally had often quarreled with Ralph Yarborough but, unlike Johnson, had not settled his differences with him.  When Don Yarborough, a fellow liberal and close associate of Ralph Yarborough's but no relation, announced that he would again oppose Connally in the Democratic Primary, Connally was gravely offended and decided to launch a major attack on the liberals.</span></p> <p><span>His first task, of course, was to find an opponent for Ralph Yarborough which he did by persuading conservative Joe Kilgore to run for the Senate rather than for re-election to Congress.  Then the Governor of Texas received a telephone call from the President of the United States and Kilgore withdrew.  Senator Yarborough was left with only one opponent, a Dallas broadcaster who conducted one of the dirtiest campaigns of recent times but lost nonetheless.</span></p> <p><span>The rift between Johnson and Connally was short-lived but it was enough to encourage the liberals considerably.  They concluded that the President was committed to a liberal program and wanted to see men elected to the Senate who would support that program.  They hoped also that he might be remembering the lessons he learned as a protege to Franklin Roosevelt.</span></p> <p><span>They sometimes suggested that perhaps his ancient support for local conservatives was based on the fact that Johnson was a pragmatic politician with a basically conservative constituency; now that the entire nation was his electorate Johnson could pursue his liberal views more freely.  And a number of them believed that the Presidency had washed away the clinging conservatives and made him clean.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>Liberal Solutions?</i></b></span></p> <p><span>\"The only thing left for Lyndon Johnson,\" a leading Texas liberal said recently, \"is for history to remember him in a fine sort of way.\"  In order to achieve this remembrance, it was reasoned, Johnson would tackle the greatest problems of the day:  peace, poverty, civil rights.  The solution to these problems are inevitably liberal ones and so the liberals were encouraged.</span></p> <p><span>But at the same time there was the nagging problem of local politics.  Governor Connally was handily reelected, garnering an immense sympathy vote for his having been wounded when President Kennedy was killed.  He then set about to increase his hold on the Texas Democratic Party.  In all the significant countries of the state, the Connally forces and the liberals battled to gain control of the delegations to the state convention.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>Connally Triumphs</i></b></span></p> <p><span>In San Antonio, where the liberals are stronger than any place else in Texas, Connally's supporters were greatly out-numbered at the county convention and so they walked out, held a rump convenion, and named their own delegates to the state convention.  The Connally-dominated credentials committee at the State Convention seated the illegitimate delegation and Connally's control was complete.  At county conventions where liberals prevailed, resolutions had been passed endorsing President Johnson and his program; where Connally prevailed, the President was endorsed but never his program.</span></p> <p><span>By controlling the state convention, Connally also gained control of the Texas delegation to the Democratic National Convention and a conservative delegation it was:  one of Texas' representatives on the platform committee was Price Daniel, a former Governor who enacted three anti-civil rights bills during his time in office.  Connally is also systematically removing the liberals from the state Democratic Executive Committee.</span></p> <p><span>The President has so far attempted to remain outwardly aloof from the conflicts in Texas.  He did choose Governor Connally to place his name in nomination at the Atlantic City convention but that was natural enough since Connally was chairman of the delegation from Johnson's home state.  He has also gone to great lengths to cement his relations with Ralph Yarborough and there is no doubt that the Senator wholeheartedly supports him.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>And Texas Too?</i></b></span></p> <p><span>There is some possibility that Johnson will succeed in staying out of the fights in Texas even after the election; \"he's got the world now,\" a friend of his has said, \"why should he bother with Texas?\"  But the in-fighting may grow so intense that he will be forced to intercede, for Johnson has no fondness for unmended fences.</span></p> <p><span>In spite of these squabbles, the Johnson-Humphrey ticket will carry Texas by a better margin than the Kennedy-Johnson ticket did and might even win sixty per cent of the vote.  A private poll conducted in bellwether sections of the state indicates that he is doing handsomely in all areas except in low income, non-Negro neighborhoods where there is some evidence of heavy \"white backlash\" sentiment.</span></p> <p><span>He will retain much of his old conservative support and in so doing will deliver a major set-back to Texas Republicans who had ironically based all their hopes on a ticket headed by Barry Goldwater.  And he will carry virtually all the liberals either because they have the high hope that he will be a great President, in the Roosevelt fashion, or because they recognize him as much the better of two evils.</span></p> <p><span>The year of pointed confusion for Texas that has followed the assassination of John Kennedy may well be succeeded by some bitter times for that province.  Either the conservatives or the liberals will have been wrong in supporting Lyndon Johnson.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Harvard and Mississippi | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>On Thursday a group of students who will be working for civil rights in Mississippi this summer presented the University with a report deploring Harvard's investment in that state.  The students have asked President Pusey to submit the statement to today's meeting of the Corporation.</span></p> <p><span>According to the report, Harvard is the largest stockholder in Middle South Utilities, Inc., a holding company which owns four major power companies in Mississippi, Arkansas, and Louisiana.

Yet the ink-spattered devils of the nation's press could hardly be in it for the money:  they could make more as electricians and work better hours.  They are not exactly showered with glory or prestige, and only a well-publicized, atypical few attain \"positions of power.\"</span></p> <p><span>Why, then, do they do it?  Some journalists--the good ones at least--sustain the cherished faith that they are performing a noble service without which democracy could not endure.</span></p> <p><span>Despite academic arguments about the infeasibility of modern democracy, citizens still vote for their president and representatives in Congress.  And if these elections are to have any meaning in terms of the issue facing the nation, the press must perform the task of educating an uninterested, ill-equipped, distracted electorate.</span></p> <p><span>The New York <i>Times</i> has thus published an <i>Election Handbook,</i> which contains between its paper (and therefore cheap) covers a cogent summary of information relevant to the forthcoming election.  The book is not meant for Harvard government majors, perhaps not even for the most impenetrable science types.  It is meants for the average voter who, alas, probably won't read it.  Nevertheless, the <i>Election Handbook</i> is a valuable public service.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>Far From Scholarly</i></b></span></p> <p><span>The book is not a triumph of scholarship.  Some articles (all are written by <i>Times</i> reporters and editors), such as Tom Wicker's \"The President,\" read like a bad Gov 1 text.  Others, such as the articles on the issues--civil rights, economics, war and peace--read like warmed-over Sunday magazine pieces.  The best articles are an intelligent analysis of \"The Republican Strategy\" by Joseph Loftus, and a witty discussion of the \"Imponderables\" of electioneering by Cabell Phillips.  The final third of the book is a consise rundown of the political situation in each state, and the back is an election night scorecard.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>Capsules on Candidates</i></b></span></p> <p><span>The most entertaining section contains capsule descriptions of the candidates, and reveals the following facts:  Yale men (Shriver, Scranton, Morton) outnumber the Harvard men (Lodge, R.F. Kennedy); three vice-presidential hopefuls (Humphrey, Hatfield, McCarthy) are former college professors; Goldwater's wife's maiden name was Johnson; Lodge has stomach ulcers.</span></p> <p><span>Some of the short descriptions are amusing.  (Bobby Kennedy is termed an \"avowed enemy of James R. Hoffa\").  But even brevity is no excuse for such barbarities as the note which says Sargent Shriver \"Insists that intellectuals should have a role in American life.\"  And is it fair to say that Richard Nixon thinks the \"U.S. goal must be free Cuba, free Soviet Union, free China\"?  Surely he has not abandoned the oppressed peoples of Eastern Europe or Tierra del Fuego.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>Ungainly Prose</i></b></span></p> <p><span>Unavoidably, events render parts of a book like this irrelevant.  Moreover, the <i>Handbook</i> is written in the same ungainly prose (\"The Kennedy political problems will be treated as having passed with him\") that clutters the daily <i>Times.</i></span></p> <p><span>The role of the newspaper remains that of teacher and this book, despite many grevious faults, is thus a worthwhile undertaking.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Liberal Retreat | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Liberals are reacting to Governor Wallace's coup in Wisconsin with an optimism bordering on the quixotic.  James Farmer of CORE disposed of the Wisconsin returns with the rather obvious if not reassuring, observation that \"there are many prejudiced people in the North as well as in the South.\"  President Johnson tried to smooth ruffled feathers by reciting the vote totals with a curious voice inflection:  \"<i>Seventy-five</i> percent voted <i>against</i> Wallace, while <i>only</i> twenty-five percent voted for him.\"  Smiling after a disaster is, admittedly, part of politics.  However, with another crisis, the 1964 elections looming seven months away, a realistc furrowing of brows might be more appropriate.</span></p> <p><span>The President can hold conservative Democrats in the North, but only by presenting the civil rights issue as something it isn't.  If he praises the present rights bill but hedges on its enforcement, stresses specific legal rights but avoids discussing general racial equality, kisses babies but remains mute on their parents' \"flight from the cities,\" the President can neutralize civil rights as an issue.  Such a strategy ignores many important racial problems facing the country, but there is time for reality after November.</span></p> <p><span>The important racial problems, as liberals see them, can only be scratched by the civil rights bill.  Liberals want the government dedicated to complete integration, not just perfunctory desegregation.  This requires a frontal attack on such politically sticky areas as the tax structure, fair housing legislation, and public school financing.</span></p> <p><span>Before the Wisconsin primary, many liberals hoped to see their ideas incorporated into the 1964 Democratic campaign.  Ideally, Mr. Johnson would present civil rights as a moral not a legal issue.  He would exhort whites to open their suburbs and private clubs to Negroes.</span></p> <p><span>At the same time massive demonstrations throughout the country would stimulate violence in the South but a \"crisis of conscience\" in the North.  Confronted with bigotry in his backyard, the white moderate would feel shame for himself rather than sympathy for his Southern counterpart.  In the cities, liberals hoped that the fusing of economic and civil rights issues would more firmly unite the Negro and the trade-unionist.  The President's homespun drawl would hold the South.</span></p> <p><span>After the Wisconsin primary, this strategy is bankrupt.  Wallace received disturbingly heavy support from Milwaukee's workers; the trade-unionists of Gary will probably behave similarly in the Indiana primary.  Furthermore, white suburbanites, both the very rich and those on the lip of Milwaukee's industrial area, gave Wallace many votes.  The white revolt has materialized, dashing liberal hopes for a \"crisis of conscience\" or an interracial alliance of the urban lower classes.</span></p> <p><span>The old liberal strategy on civil rights aimed at telling the truth, educating the nation, and almost incidentally electing Mr. Johnson.  Now the priorities must be reversed.  The major task is the defensive one of fighting the propaganda of urban racists and reassuring the white worker that the rights bill and the Democratic ticket will not \"go too far.\"  Economic issues need not be stressed, for none of the Republican candidates under consideration can snare the labor vote if the race issue remains dormant.</span></p> <p><span>In the suburbs, the campaign should reassure rather then educate.  The key here is not race, but status.  Many suburbanites rarely see and never look at a Negro.  Their fear of the revolution resembles their anxiety over creeping socialism, the Communist conspiracy, high income taxes--anything, in short that challenges their newly-won status.  They are sincerely attracted to Wallace's conservatism and only tangentially fascinated by his racism.  Negro demands should be painted as traditionally American and mainly legal, as pleas for human rights, not for social or racial equality.  Talk of <i>de facto</i> segregaton and housing covenants should be judiciously avoided.  The campaign, in short, must counter racist demogoguery by appealing to the paternalistic self-righteousness of the suburbanite.</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps the most odious facet of this strategy involves the liberal's relationship with the Negro:  the liberal must again urge patience.  Demonstrations in the South should focus on specific grievances that the Northern moderate can comprehend easily.  If violence occurs, blame must lie clearly with the white Southerner.  In the North, violence could prove fatal to the President's chances; the white is incapable of understanding why irrational treatment of the Negro should elicit an irrational response.  In general, direct action in the North should be discouraged this summer.</span></p> <p><span>The liberal then has a thankless task.  He must swallow his principles, obfuscate the issues, and pander to the ignorant.  This might all be more-or-less good political fun if he did not also have to turn his back on the Negro and again mutter \"wait a little longer.\"  There is but one consolation:  if the liberal plays the hypocrite well, there will be ample opportunity to make up for it next year.</span></p>"}

{"title": "World's Fair | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The World's Fair looks as if it had been created by some usually normal person who had taken meascaline and allowed his consciousness to go wild.  The world's biggest cheese a (seventeen-ton cheddar) sits near a simulated cigar chimney that blows ten-foot smokerings 150 feet into the air.  Near the \"Festival of Gas\" loom nine life-size dinosaurs, and one display boasts a \"university for porpoises..\"</span></p> <p><span>In part the fair is Mainstreet cum Madison Avenue out of control, a veritable phantasmagoria of garish commercialism.  But even the blatantly tawdy has its fascination.  So does the sideshow atmosphere of a Ford convertible ride to Walt Disney's dinosaur-land and \"Space City,\" an \"audio-animatronic\" Abe Lincoln, and a Ferris Wheel disguised as a giant tire.</span></p> <p><span>But the fair is more than a legacy of P.T. Barum's vulgarity and showmanship.  There remain exhibits that combine both beauty and taste--the Pieta, of course; the gigantic scale model of New York City; and the Federal Pavilion that stresses some of the glittering aspects of American development such as immigration, urban blight, and the integration struggle.  The United States also plans to offer productions of Shakespeare, ballets and concerts in its courtyard, as well as symposiums given by Noble prize-winners inside.  In addition, the city's Museum of Science, if ever completed, promises an intriguing, permanent exhibition.</span></p> <p><span>The most exciting display to mark the rainy opening day, though, did not come from the hands of the irrepressible Robert Moses but rather from the voices and placards of civil rights demonstrators.  Although the vaunted stall-ins failed to materialize and the number of picketers (and arrests) proved small, the spirit of protest seemed omnipresent.  The opening ceremonies alone escaped.  When President Johnson spoke at the Federal Pavilion, voices (most of them belonging to white teenagers) interrupted his speech with barely comprehensible cries of \"freedom, freedom.\"  James Farmer, cattle-prod in hand, was arrested at the Louisiana exhibit, and protesters forced the Missouri display to close.</span></p> <p><span>The civil rights demonstrations not only provided excitement; they also served as a constant, though unpleasant, reminder that the fair was in part a caricature of American affluence, wastefulness, and indifference.  Situated only twenty minutes away from the slums of Bedford-Stuyvesant and Harlem, the fair seems to deny existence of deprivation and hardship.  What twisted irony it is that General Motors can spend over $50 million on a building that will be torn down in two years.  With the exception of the Science Museum, the city pavilion, and a very few other buildings, all the rest of the fair will be destroyed.  Not that most of the buildings should be preserved (far too many are architectural abominations), but certainly some could be put to permanent use.</span></p> <p><span>But even if the World's Fair fails to fulfill its promise of \"Peace through Understanding,\" and even if it denies so much of America, it still provides an enjoyable trip into a gaudily tinseled euphoria and a partial insight into our national character.</span></p>"}

{"title": "VIOLENCE AND MISSISSIPPI | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>To the Editors of the CRIMSON:</span></p> <p><span>While we have been more than grateful for your coverage of and interest in the civil rights movement, we would like to comment on two recent articles in the CRIMSON which have given rise to certain misconceptions about this summer's Mississippi COFO project.</span></p> <p><span>Some confusion has resulted from an article which appeared a few weeks ago regarding the role of white women in the project.  Our policy is not to discourage anyone from applying; however, the number of white women actually accepted may depend on the places where they can work in comparative safety--both for the local residents with whom they will be living and working, and for themselves.  This is the only limitation.</span></p> <p><span>But Michael Lerner presents graver misconceptions in his article, 'Our Blood,' April 30.</span></p> <p><span>According to him, there are two alternatives:  slaughter and racial clash.  But there is another alternative which Mr. Lerner apparently did not consider:  the intervention and protection by the Federal Government, which we consider has the duty and the obligation to protect American citizens -- even in Mississippi -- who will be conducting themselves in a constitutional manner to attain rights already guaranteed to them by the same constitution.</span></p> <p><span>Mr. Lerner's analysis of the students going to Mississippi is inaccurate.  The fact is that most of the students whom we have interviewed for the project, far from being secret thrill-seekers, are honest and sincere young people who honestly and sincerely believe that their participation in such a program will contribute to American democracy.  Perhaps these sentiments are by now so trite and rare that they are mistrusted by Mr. Lerner, who seeks other unconscious drives for their actions.</span></p> <p><span>These students understand the risks involved in such an undertaking, and none look forward to being injured--and certainly not to injuring anyone else.</span></p> <p><span>Naturally we are aware of the potential for \"slaughter\" and \"racial clash,\" as Mr. Lerner puts it, but if he had asked us, we would have told him what we are doing to avoid these possibilities.</span></p> <p><span>In the first place, we are insisting that the Federal Government of the Uniteed States act to enforce the U.S. Constitution.  We are not merely saying this, but working on petitions, planning delegations to President Johnson, and other such actions -- well in advance of the beginning of the Mississippi project.</span></p> <p><span>Secondly, we are safeguarding against the \"escalation\" of \"racial clash\" in several ways; we are conducting the most extensive interviews possible to determine emotional maturity, discipline, and non-violent conduct.  We will hold one orientation session here for New England applicants in late May, and all applicants for the project will undergo extensive training in Berea, Kentucky in June before departure for Missisippi.  None of this indicates either that SNCC will accept young people who cannot act in a disciplined fashion under what will certainly be dangerous circumstances, or that students are looked upon as expendable \"cannon fodder\" to be put to \"tactical advantage.\"</span></p> <p><span>Of course there is yet one other way of avoiding all conflict in Mississippi this summer, and that is simply not to go.  Strangely enough, the proponents of the status quo in Mississippi also use reason of \"slaughter\" and \"racial clash\" to justify leaving the state in the hands of the White Citizens Council and the Negro population to its usual state of maleducation, harassment, and deprivation.  But we do not intend to take what undoubtedly would be this \"safer\" course, and leave matters as they are; despite these real risks, we are going ahead with the project in the hopes that the majority of white Americans of whom Mr. Lerner speaks may realize its responsibilities to the subjected minority. <b>Mrs. Dorothy Zeliner</b> \u00a0\u00a0<b>Mrs. Peggy Day</b> \u00a0\u00a0<b>New England Representatives SNCC</b></span></p> <p><span><b>MR. LERNER REPLIES:</b></span></p> <p><span><b>According to the above letter, SNCC is doing three things to avoid violence.  It is interviewing everyone who goes South under SNCC auspices, it is training them in Kentucky in June, and it is petitioning the U.S. government to intervene in Mississippi.</b></span></p> <p><span><b>The training precautions are laudable, although it should be added that armies have discovered men do not always react in the field as they do in training.</b></span></p> <p><span><b>But the central argument in the letter is that I have ignored the \"alternative\" of Federal intervention.  I did not ignore the possibility that the President might order troops into Mississippi as a last resort in the event of terrible violence.  This is not what Mrs. Zellner and Mrs. Day mean.  They mean that I ignored the possibility of Presidential intervention before this violence occurs, \"to protect American citizens...who will be conducting themselves in a constitutional manner.\"</b></span></p> <p><span><b>If Mrs. Zellner and Mrs. Day believe that SNCC petitions will convince President Johnson in an election year to intervene before the last possible moment, they are naive.  Johnson will not intervene to protect the rights of SNCC workers, but only to suppress violence.</b></span></p> <p><span><b>Finally, the parallel implied between my position and that of the White Citizens Council is not fruitful.  I detest segregation, although I may not always faithfully follow the SNCC view.</b></span></p>"}

{"title": "The Man From Scranton | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>As Barry Goldwater pulls into undisputed first place in the number of committed delegates to the Republican National Convention, a very distant second place is held down at the moment by the enigmatic governor of Pennsylvania.  William Warren Scranton.</span></p> <p><span>Scranton gained sixty-one of his sixty-three delegates in last Tuesday's Pennsylvania Presidential primary.  (Two North Dakota delegates have declared for Scranton, and three favoring Goldwater were chosen in Pennsylvania.)  The Scranton vote in his home state has been regarded by most observers as merely an expression of support for a \"favorite son\" who can \"maintain the unity of the delegation.\"  In any case, the governor's show of strength could be a significant force in San Francisco this July.</span></p> <p><span>The vote in Pennsylvania is anything but an over-whelming endorsement of Scranton as a Presidential candidate, While forces backing the unwilling governor had conducted an intensive write-in campaign, Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge added to his recent impressive victories by capturing about twenty per cent of the vote with almost no effort at all, and Richard Nixon outpolled Goldwater.</span></p> <p><span>Scranton's 225,000 votes are far short of the 300,000 goal that some supporters predicted, but any analysis is marred by the conditions of the election and the voting procedure.  In the first place, heavy rain and a paucity of real contests on their side kept many Republicans from the polls.  In addition, more than half the precincts in the state have voting machines, on which it is difficult to register a write-in vote.  (No candidate was on the ballot.)</span></p> <p><span>Nevertheless, 225,000 votes set a record for Presidential candidates and non-candidates in Pennsylvania; this is a larger vote than John F. Kennedy amassed in the 1960 Democratic primary when he was already campaigning intensively, but it was a smaller percentage of the vote than Kennedy's was.  Pennsylvania Republicans are obviously pleased with the Governor's performance during his first year and a half in office, and the growing size of the \"Scranton-for-President Clubs\" is indicative of their enthusiasm for offering his name as a nominee.</span></p> <p><span>The \"clubs\" are ready to begin an all-out campaign, but the question remains whether or not Scranton is in fact interested in the Presidential nomination.  At a recent news conference in Harrisburg he revealed that a vacation in Florida had convinced him to do absolutely nothing; only an \"honest and sincere draft\" could interest him in the nomination.  The new solution to the flood of requests for interviews has been to refuse them, and on the surface Scranton seems to be discouraging publicity.</span></p> <p><span>And yet, at the same time, much to the relief of his supporters, he has begun to act and speak like a potential candidate.  He has fulfilled the hopes of many that he would begin to enunciate his views, so that there might be more reason to support him than his face, age, and clean record.  In a speech for a Yale Law School award ceremony, he had indicated the failure of the Republican Party to lead the country over the past thirty years.  The party, he said, should support a policy whereby Congress sets goals for programs and appropriates necessary funds, but gives \"maximum authority for implementation to a strong, effective state government.\"  This, he contended, is the \"pragmatic way of actually getting this country moving.\"</span></p> <p><span>In sharp contrast to Michigan's George Romney.  Scranton has had remarkable success with his program as governor, with only his bid for a convention to revise the state constitution failing narrowly.  Though he had militant opposition from organized labor, he managed to pass substantial revisions of the state's unemployment compensation laws in a special session of the General Assembly.</span></p> <p><span>Scranton showed he is able to act quickly in a crisis in recent weeks, as he moved to settle the Chester, Pennsylvania, school segregation dispute.  If the state Human Rclations Commission fails to come up with a satisfactory solution, Scranton will have an opportunity to put into practical acts his earlier pronouncements on American racial problems.</span></p> <p><span>With each public denial and private step forward, people will continue to watch Scranton closely.  Those sixty-three first-ballot convention votes may be extremely important, as a rallying point for a Scranton drive before or during the convention, a decisive bloc that could go any way in the case of a deadlocked convention, or the core for a vice-Presidential attempt.  At any rate, Scranton will probably be without a job in 1966, since he cannot succeed himself as governor and no Senate seat will be available.  Certainly he would want to be on good terms with any Republican administration.</span></p>"}

He expressed hope that provisions for the corps would be included in some future legislation.</span></p> <p><span><b>Worst Teachers</b></span></p> <p><span>The teaching corps is needed, Galbraith said, because the poorest communities almost always have the worst teachers.  His plan would provide a core of teachers, counselors, and administrators to work through the public school systems in these communities.  Their example presumably would draw more high-quality personnel to the schools.</span></p> <p><span>Finances for the corps would come from the federal government.

His offer Saturday to \"review\" rather than \"discuss\" the all issues with Panama neither moderates nor clarifies the Administration's stance and does not satisfy Panama's insistence that the United States agree to \"negotiate.\"  Panama may, for some reason, accept the President's latest gambit and agree to resume diplomatic relations and begin the \"review.\"  If Panama refuses, however, the dispute will probably stalemate, since Johnson seems unwilling to concede anything more.</span></p> <p><span>An unresolved quarrel over the Canal would have badly embarrassed and encumbered President Kennedy's Latin American policies, but President Johnson may have decided that the domestic political damage from concessions to Panama would outweigh the benefits for his Latin American policies.  The \"tough\" and \"pragmatic\" approach, revealed last week in Johnson's speech to the OAS and in Assistant Secretary Thomas G. Mann's reported remarks to the assembled U.S. ambassadors, does not depend upon popular approval in Latin America.  Neither does it attract popular approval, which the U.S. must have to champion democratic revolution as an alternative to Castro's kind.  Therefore, the Administration should be especially careful to exploit every opportunity for attracting public support and conciliating the diplomats it will have to handle roughly at other tmes.</span></p> <p><span>Coupling the Panama Canal dispute with the construction of a new Canal would offer both sides an escape from the current impasse; it could also reduce the unfortunate effects of Johnson's Latin American policies, and bolster the Organization of American States, which has suffered seriously from its unsuccessful attempts to mediate the controversy.</span></p> <p><span><b>Lockless, Sea-Level Canal</b></span></p> <p><span>A lockless, sea-level canal, blasted by buried atomic devices, may be feasible.  It certainly is desirable for commercial and military reasons.  Neither the larger merchant and passenger ships, nor the U.S. Navy's nuclear carriers will fit through the Panama Canal.  Washington could offer to relinquish its sovereignty over the Canal Zone at the completion of a new canal or to renegotiate the 1903 Panama Canal Treaty, should a new canal not be operating within some agreed number of years--perhaps ten.  This formula would permit Panama to say that it had won either renogotiation or the Canal itself and would protect Johnson politically by ending the current dispute wthout capitulation to Panama's demands.</span></p> <p><span>If the construction and operation of the new Canal were directed by the OAS, the waterway would serve as more than a boon to shipping and a means of ending the persistent hassles caused by the Panama Canal.  The United States would have to bear most of the costs, and would deserve most of the revenues.  Provisions for military security might be hard to arrange, but would also be much less critical than they are at the Panama Canal, where a few sticks of dynamite could knock a lock out of operation for months.</span></p> <p><span>The United States would sacrifice very little, economically or militarily, by making a sea-level canal an OAS project.  The OAS would gain new authority and prestige.  And a United States proposal for an OAS canal would help repair the damage done by last week's indications from Washington that democracy in this hemisphere is negotiable, while a sixty-year-old treaty is not.</span></p>"}

This is doubly alarming, since Mann has been entrusted by the President with sole responsibility for U.S. policy in this area; his speech therefore indicates what Johnson's Latin American policy will probably be.</span></p> <p><span>Speaking at a briefing of high-ranking officials, Mann said that the former U.S. policy aimed at restraining dictatorships had proved unworkable.  He further stated that the new administration's aims would be four:  1) Fostering of economic growth, 2) Protection of U.S. investment, 3) Non-intervention in the internal affairs of the republics, and 4) Opposition to Communism.</span></p> <p><span>In a certain sense, of course, Mann is right.  As the futile ten-year struggle to oust Peron demonstrated, American attempts to unseat Latin American dictators have been largely ineffective.  The danger of a policy of supporting dictatorships, however, is that they eventually fall.  At that time, those who supported them become targets for legitimate resentments aroused by the dictators.</span></p> <p><span>Expressing distaste for dictators, on the other hand, encourages the liberal oppostion behind the authoritarian regimes.  Whatever its defects, the United States remains for most Latin Americans the leading example of functioning democracy.  To see Washington supporting repressive regimes undermines their faith in the workability of democratic ideals and open societies.  Furthermore, acceptance of military take-over in one country stimulates reactionary groups in others.  While suspension of recognition and aid may not succeed in overthrowing a specific despotic government, the threat of these steps nevertheless constitute an effective deterrent to those who would seize power elsewhere.</span></p> <p><span>As for Mann's four points, they sin more by omission than commission.  There is no mention in his speech of the struggle for economic reform and social justice to which the United States pledged itself at Punta del Este.  The agrarian reform and changes in tax structure which are fundamental prerequisites of meaningful development in Latin America can scarcely be attained by a policy of protecting U.S. interests.  Mann's declared policy aims represent, in fact, the abandonment of all the promising features of the Alliance for Progress, and a regression to the diplomacy of short-sighted pecuniary interest characteristic of the Eisenhower years.</span></p> <p><span>That Mann would scuttle the Alliance was not unexpected in Latin America.  Last November, former President Alberto Lleras Camargo of Colombia, a firm friend of the United States and of the Alliance, refused to head the inter-American committee which will administer the Alliance because he mistrusted Mann's views on social reform.  But that the Alliance should be abandoned with so little ceremony was not foreseen.  Mann's statement in effect gives a green light to the military in Latin America.  With rightist elements in Brazil and eleswhere clamoring for military take-over in their countries, it will be suprising if the new U.S. position does not lead to coups in several countries.</span></p> <p><span>The United States cannot afford to insist on isolation of all military regimes.  A coup in Brazil, for example, could not profitably be opposed for long.  But there is a difference between unwilling tolerance and declared acceptance of military dictatorship.  If the United States, after 190 years of democratic government cannot distinguish between democracy and dictatorship, Latin American nations can hardly be expected to do so.  If they cannot, there is slight hope for the peaceful and democratic change which U.S. policy should hope to foster.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Theodore Sorensen | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>When Theodore Sorensen moved into Leverett Towers, he secluded himself in a sparsely furnished tutor's suite with some books and a few belongings.  For a week no one saw him.</span></p> <p><span>He made his first appearance in the Dining Hall for lunch.  Conversation teetered on neutral subjects--mathematical tricks and why the Leverett elevators only stop every second floor.  At the end of the first meal, Sorensen was reminded that at Harvard one returns one's tray to the kitchen.</span></p> <p><span>Since these first encounters with the House, Sorensen has relaxed considerably.  But he is not a talkative man.  At an interview soon after he moved into Leverett, he answered questions easily but maintained a deep reserve.  Wearing one of the dark suits he favors and a PT boat tieclip, Sorensen spoke with a trace of a smile, specifying as he went where he could be quoted.  It was hard to ask him about Kennedy because the questions seemed so personal.  What, for example, were some of the greatest popular misconceptions about Kennedy?  \"I would rather the answer to that appeared in my book than in the columns of the CRIMSON.\"</span></p> <p><span>Did the prospect of writing the book on Kennedy scare him?  \"Scared isn't the word I would have chosen--perhaps overawed.\"  The problem of the book's scope bothered Sorensen, \"and there is the difficulty of classified material:  I wouldn't do anything to endanger present security, but I have a responsibility to history, too.  It will be a personal, not a comprehensive book.\"</span></p> <p><span>Sorensen would talk more straightforwardly on general questions about politics.  Students interested in political careers, he said, \"should go to law school.  A degree in government doesn't help because they don't teach what you need to know.\"  Advice from consultants outside government \"generally isn't worth much--It's too academic.\"</span></p> <p><span>At the same time, Sorensen showed a pride in the craft of politics which he expressed as what \"a good politician\" should do.  Do you get used to criticism?  \"A good politician has to.\"  Would personal antagonisms affect the choice of the next Democratic Vice-Presidential candidate?  \"A good politician can't afford to let that happen.\"</span></p> <p><span>The sense of how a good politician acts did not come only from the eleven-year experience with John F. Kennedy.  Although on a smaller scale than the late President, Sorensen was also brought up on politics.  His father, Christian Abraham Sorensen, rose from the Nebraska prairie sod house in which he was born to become state attorney general.  His mother, Annis Chaikin Sorensen, was a convinced pacifist and feminist from a Russian-Jewish family.</span></p> <p><span>It is recorded that \"Christian Sorensen often took his son Ted to meetings on public utilities, and he sometimes had the child address the audience with a 'few words' from the platform.\"  The story may be apocryphal.  But while Jack grew up listening to powerful politicians talk conservative politics around Ambassador Kennedy's table, Ted grew up in a household of liberal books and magazines.  The Sorensen home was a gathering place for progressive Nebraskans who debated the issues of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal.</span></p> <p><span>At about the time his future chief was serving in the Pacific, Sorensen graduated from Lincoln High School and entered the University of Nebraska on a Regents scholarship to take the pre-law curriculum.  He chaired the mock United Nations convention, the campus constitutional convention, and the University YMCA, while continuing to follow high school interest in debating, drama, and the band.  In 1949 he entered the University's law school, edited the <i>Nebraska Law Review,</i> and lobbied during spare time in the state legislature for a Fair Employment Practices Committee.  He still managed to spend enough time studying to graduate first in his class in 1951.  His family hoped he would practice in Lincoln, but Sorensen headed for Washington, D.C.</span></p> <p><span>The story of Sorensen's career with the then newly-elected Senator from Massachusetts is too complicated to tell in detail.  Sorensen was recommended to Kennedy in 1953 by Sen. Paul Douglas of Illinois.  Kennedy hired him to work on problems of New England -- \"I wasn't prejudiced,\" Sorensen adds, \"because I had never been there.\"  In 1954 Sorensen drafted speeches for Kennedy; in '55 he researched <i>Profiles in Courage;</i> and in '56 he urged Kennedy to try for the Vice-Presidential nomination.  In 1960, Kennedy said:  \"I want to keep Ted with me wherever I go in this campaign.  You need somebody whom you can trust implicitly.\"</span></p> <p><span>Sorensen was trusted implicitly in the White House, too, and with the exception of Robert F. Kennedy he was the President's closest adviser.  He had a scrap with Barry Goldwater in the fall of 1961, when the Arizona conservative read into the <i>Congressional Record</i> a story for the Chicago <i>Tribune</i> which stated that \"the man behind President Kennedy's rocking chair in a world with war tensions, escaped military service as a conscientious objector and Korean War service as a father.\"  For the rest, he remained in the background:  what he contributed to the fabric of Kennedy statements was almost impossible to distinguish from the rest.  \"I knew the way Kennedy thought, and how he would say things,\" Sorensen explains simply.</span></p> <p><span>That leaves a great deal unsaid about Sorensen's influence on Kennedy.  He joined Kennedy as a militant A.D.A. liberal when the junior senator was conservative enough to avoid the censure vote on Sen. McCarthy.  Eight years later President Kennedy was proposing the Peace Corps and the Alliance for Progress.  Something very basic had changed in Kennedy's thought during those eight years.  Certainly Sorensen was in part responsible.  Twelve years after graduating from law school, Sorensen is back on a campus again.  He smiles when asked what he plans to do.  \"I guess I'll be interested in and fascinated by politics all of my life.  I won't teach and I don't plan to write another book.\"  Sorensen considers himself too liberal for Nebraska politics.  Would he take up residence in another state and work toward political office?  \"Oh I suppose I could.  But when you've done what I've done, it's hard to start from the begining again, and work your way up to assistant governor.  No, my contribution to politics won't be as a candidate.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "LBJ's Unstrategic Retreat | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>President Johnson does not like to bat his head against stone walls.  One of the most effective pieces of masonry in Congress is Rep. Otto E. Passman (D-La.), who for years has made a career of blocking the road between the treasury and the various foreign aid administrations.  Last week Johnson decided to surrender rather than continue an increasingly risky political battle.  Amidst protestations of impotence (\"I think it is going to be very tough to get a good foreign aid measure through Congress this year\"), Johnson asked for what he called \"a great deal of money\":  $3.4 billion, or $15 billion less than President Kennedy asked last year.  The request is about the same as last year's House authorization, which Kennedy termed \"reckless\" and \"irresponsible.\"  Congressional sources are predicting appropriations of as low as $2.5 billion and certainly not more than $3 billion.</span></p> <p><span>Although opposition to foreign aid is becoming increasingly powerful--the House recently turned down a modest program for financing a World Bank affiliate--the President need not have presented the aid program to its opponents as a gift.  Congressional cuts from Administration requests during the last decade have averaged nearly $850 million each year, and Johnson knows that something like that amount is sure to be cut this year, especially in view of the fall elections.  But the bill is passed each year, even though it has become something of a political whipping boy.  Staunch Administration stands have several times kept cuts to a minimum.  In 1961 President Kennedy asked for $4.8 billion and received $4.4 billion plus the new administrative organization he proposed.  He lost only on his controversial suggestion for treasury borrowing authority.  Johnson, who has much more influence in Congress now than Kennedy did in 1961, could certainly have kept aid appropriations from hitting a new low if he wanted to.  As things stand now, the Agency for International Development hasn't the least chance of receiving even as much as its pitifully low appropriations of this year.</span></p> <p><span>Johnson has adopted the very same surrender tactics that proved such a disaster for his predecessor last year.  When Kennedy accepted the recommendations of the Clay Committee last spring and reduced his own earlier request by $400 million he was met not with Congressional approval but with an additional $1.5 billion in cuts.  Slashing the foreign aid budget had become a useful game, and Congress was not going to allow the the President to steal all its best plays.  The same thing will no doubt happen this year.</span></p> <p><span>It need not happen, however, if Johnson were to stand up for foreign aid instead of allowing its opponents to monopolize the debate.  Johnson's public questioning of the soundness of AID's administrative structure, his amputation of the Alliance for Progress from AID's control, and his demand for less aid to fewer countries are all attempts to buy off the Congressional opposition.  The last suggestion is even borrowed directly from the most vociferous of the opposition last year, who spent a good part of the summer trying to agree on the number of countries receiving U. S. foreign aid.</span></p> <p><span>Johnson should make the necessity for foreign aid a basic part of the foreign policy program which will play a large part in his campaign.  Instead of patting Otto Passman on the back, he should call his bluff.  In the same television press conference in which he conceded that foreign aid would have a rough going this year, Johnson lashed out at those who thought all international problems could be solved by \"mashing a button.\"  These same people are opposing the AID program, and they should be attacked with equal energy.</span></p> <p><span>Last year the House Republicans made foreign aid a partisan measure.  Ignoring Speaker McCormack's call for a bipartisan approach, they lined up almost to a man behind their leadership in demanding deep cuts in the authorization.  Johnson, who has quite a bit of skill at such matters, could accept this challenge if he wanted to.  He could make foreign aid an essential part of his political program instead of leaving it in the no-man's-land of \"bipartisan foreign policy.\"  Foreign policy is not bipartisan in an election year, and if Johnson would be willing to expend a little of his already tremendous reserve of public support and Congressional good will, he could get a workable aid program through Congress.  But to do so he would have to stop conceding every point before the contest even begins.  A few judicious pats on the right Congressional elbows, combined with some enthusiastic public statements about the need for foreign aid, could make the difference.  If Kennedy with his narrow 1960 victory fresh in Congressional minds could do it in 1961, Johnson with his 70 per cent Gallup ratings can certainly do it in 1964.  It is only a question of will.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Johnson's Running Mate | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Perhaps the most important political decision to be made this year is the selection of the Democratic vice-Presidential nominee.  President Johnson suffered a massive heart attack nine years ago.  Actuarial statistics show an alarming mortality rate among men of the President's age after the first five years following such an attack.  Even if Johnson survived one or two terms, a fairly young and active vice-President would be a leading contender for the party's nomination in 1968 or 1972.</span></p> <p><span>A seasoned Washington commentator said recently that \"if I had to bet more money than I can afford to lose, I would bet on Sargent Shriver for the nomination.\" He listed three reasons for his choice.  First, he said that President Johnson wants to retain the loyalty and active support of the Kennedy family and of Democratic politicians throughout the country who still feel a deep allegiance to the late President.  Johnson does not want, the commentator said, to put Robert Kennedy on the ticket.  Therefore Shriver, who helped construct the Kennedy machine in 1960 and has good personal relations with many \"Kennedy men\" in the party, appears to be the only other man who can keep the Kennedy machine intact.</span></p> <p><span>Second, he said that Johnson appreciates Shriver's background in business, a background which would season him for the tough political maneuvering in which Johnson revels.  As Murray Kempton recently put it in <i>The New Republic,</i> Shriver was the only man Joseph Kennedy trused to collect his rents at the Merchandise Mart in Chicago.</span></p> <p><span>Third, the commentator said that Johnson is extremely impressed by the job Shriver has done with the Peace Corps.  His enthusiasm is increased by the fact that Bill D. Moyers--a 29-year old White House staff member whom Johnson greatly admires--actually wants to return to the Peace Corps, where he was second in command.</span></p> <p><span>Shriver's chief handicap is that he is not extremely well known and has never held elective office.  Johnson understands this deficiency.  He made Shriver director of the war on poverty partly to increase Shriver's reputation and political stock.</span></p> <p><span>Whether Johnson chooses Shriver, then, depends on how desperately the President thinks he needs him to hold the Kennedy machine.  And too, it depends on Johnson's assessment of Shriver's capacity to be a good President.</span></p> <p><span>This latter standard will be applied by Johnson and by the public to every prospective candidate.  Speaking on television Wednesday night, Walter Lippmann said that no candidate could help Johnson significantly at the polls.  Therefore, Lippmann said, the only criterion for selecting a vice-Presidential nominee should be his qualifications for the Presidency.</span></p> <p><span>If this criterion is used, the best Democratic nominee would be Sen. Hubert Humphrey.  Humphrey wants the nomination.  He has solid support from labor (although labor has not often proved to be a solid political force).  But Humphrey might be too valuable to Johnson in the Senate.  Sen. Mansfield, called by some \"his own worst critic,\" reportedly will cede the Majority Leadership to Humphrey in the next Congress.  Paradoxically, then, if Humphrey is outstanding in handling the civil rights bill he could impair his own chances to be vice-President.</span></p> <p><span>What of Robert Kennedy?  Reports of a feud between him and Johnson are probably overdone, but it is no secret that the two have never gotten along.  There is a vast difference between the two in style, personality and temperment, if not in policy.  According to reliable reports, Johnson will choose Kennedy only if political conditions make it imperative.  Kennedy may go after the nomination, at least in private.  But he will have to accept Johnson's choice.  He is young and if he decides to make politics his career, he cannot afford to alienate too many men he might rely on in the future.</span></p>"}

{"title": "White Revolt | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>No one but his campaign manager expected George Wallace to get 260,000 votes in the Wisconsin Presidential Primary.  Consequently, political commentators face the same problem sports writers had with Cassius Clay.  Like Clay, Wallace won a striking and unexpected victory, though in confusing circumstances:  the Alabama Governor showed that a militant segregationist could poll a quarter of the votes cast in a Northern state.</span></p> <p><span>Much of his vote, it has been argued, resulted from Republicans' attempts to embarrass John Reynolds, both as governor of the state and as a favorite son candidate standing in for the Johnson Administration.  There is little doubt that many Republicans did in fact cross party lines (which is easy in Wisconsin) and voted for Wallace.  In some upper-income suburbs north of Milwaukee, Wallace ran ahead of both Reynolds and the Republican favorite son, Congressman John Byrnes.  Wallace also ran well in the farm and small-town heartland of Joe McCarthy, near Appleton and Oshkosh.</span></p> <p><span>But it is unclear how many of Wallace's votes came from Republicans.  If the state's usual political alignment is considered, there may have been as many as 150,000.  Upcoming primaries in Indian and Maryland will indicate how many of these votes represent opposition to civil rights measures.  Here, Republican voters must officially change their party registration to vote for Wallace.  They will have the Wisconsin results in mind and will know that a vote for Wallace will indicate a specific and significant protest against the civil rights cause.</span></p> <p><span>George Wallace's greatest success was not with conservatively minded Republicans, but with usually liberal Democrats.  Wallace got 30 per cent of the vote in normally Democratic Milwaukee Country and did partcularly well on Milwaukee's south side, where voters mainly of Polish decent usually pile up heavy Democratic majorities.</span></p> <p><span>Here there can be little doubt that the issue was civil rights.  Many white voters do not want Negroes to move into their neighborhoods or go to school with their children.  Many fear the civil rights bill, even though it does not touch on these questions.  These fears have no place in political dialogue on the national and, usually, the state levels.  Only in local campaigns do racial issues come into sight.  On the same day George Wallace scored his success, three incumbent county supervisors on Milwaukee's south side were defeated, because, as one of them put it, his opponents \"said that he was against housing for Negroes on the south side of Milwaukee, and he convinced them that I was a leader of a group trying to bring Negro housing to the south side of Milwaukee.\"  It is hard to resist concluding that similar feelings played a part in Wallace's victory.</span></p> <p><span>The extent to which the approximately 100,000 votes case by Democrats for Governor Wallace represents opposition to civil rights demands, also will be measured more closely in Indiana and Maryland.  If large numbers of northern Democrats continue to vote for the nation's most notorious segregationist, President Johnson could be in more trouble in November than current opinion polls suggest.  Wisconsin is only one of several Northern states where Johnson can not afford to lost many once-dependable Democratic votes.</span></p> <p><span>Gains from white \"backlash\" seem to go almost entirely to Republicans.  Last fall Republicans narrowed Democratic majorities sharply by a go-slow attitude on civil rights.

But any Republican stands to gain.  Whether the Presidential candidate does so or not depends less on his statements and the Republican platform than on the politicians and professional bigots on the ward and precinct level--like the candidates for Milwaukee County supervisor.  There they can appeal to the fears and fears and prejudices that are almost never discussed in national and state campaigns.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Arbitration Legislation | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Within the past year collective bargaining in the railroad industry has become a completely hollow phrase denoting frustration and immobility.  Despite the efforts of several impartial mediation boards, the railroads's five-year-old work rules dispute was thrust into Congress last summer when the first peace time arbitration law in history was needed to prevent a crippling national walkout.</span></p> <p><span>Now a new strike is threatened over the \"minor\" issues unresolved by legislation.  All the issues left out of the compulsory arbitration law were passed upon more than two years ago by a distinguished Presidential commission.  But, although railroad management accepted the recommendations, collective bargaining has been thwarted by the five operating brotherhoods who have consistently refused to negotiate within the commission's report.</span></p> <p><span>And in an election year the unions are not likely to change their demands.  They know how reluctant Congress was to pass the arbitration bill, and they appreciate fully the desire of a Southern President with a rural background to placate the labor vote.</span></p> <p><span>Johnson has won a 15-day strike postponement, but if negotiations fail, and it appears likely that they will, he will be forced to turn to legislation.  And if he does, he should suggest a bill paralleling last year's law.  Although the brotherhoods will strongly oppose impartial arbitration because it will surely follow recommendations they dislike, President Johnson should not succumb to the pressure mounted by the unions, should not allow them to parlay political strength into unwarranted concessions from Congress.</span></p>"}

{"title": "The Harvard Review | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The editors of the <i>Harvard Review</i> have courageously turned the current issue of their magazine over to a group of scientists interested in the problems of psycho-physiology.  To attract sensitive humanists, however, they have chosen to title the issue \"A New Psychology\" and they hasten to assure their non-technical readers that the <i>approaches</i> to the problem are more significant than the <i>facts</i> that are presented.  Psychophysiologists consider only the material properties of mind.  And what makes their work so fascinating is that it revives the hoary mechanism-vitalism controversy, and suggests that the problems of free will may be placed upon an empirical footing for the first time.</span></p> <p><span>All of the contributors to the issue are aware of the staggering implications for man and society of a fool-proof predictive psychology.  Imagine for a moment that psychophysiologists are ultimately as successful in fact as they are in their wildest dreams--that they are able to understand memory and behavior on the molecular level.  This would mean that social relations could be reduced to an intricate but thoroughly comprehensive set of stimuli and responses.  If, for example, Lyndon Johnson's neural chemistry was understood in detail, and if all his sources of influence and advice were monitored, it might have been possible to predict with fair accuracy that he would send Marines to Santo Domingo in response to the civil disorder there last month.  Furthermore, if the same detailed knowledge were available about the other three billion of us--and if it were possible to correlate all of this in some monster-computer--mankind would be in possession of a genuine time machine.  It would be possible to foretell social as well as personal futures, and the uncertainties of existence would be eliminated along with all the non-psychological social sciences.</span></p> <p><span>Needless to say, none of the contributors of the <i>Review</i> indulges himself in such irresponsible speculation.  Though determinism of this sort is no more than a wild dream, I can find nothing in the magazine that rules it out as a <i>logical</i> possibility.  And it is this deterministic spectre which makes the subject so fascinating and also so appropriate for a journal of \"contemporary affairs.\"</span></p> <p><span>Strictly speaking, only four of the eight articles deal with technical matters, and only two of these require any sort of scientific background on the part of the reader.  The other two, \"Memories, Molecules, and Minds,\" by James V. McConncll, professor of Psychology at the University of Michigan, and \"Machines That Can Think,\" by Stephen F. Jencks '62, a second-year student at the Medical School and an undergraduate specialist in computer programming and information theory, are sufficient to suggest the advances looming on the horizon in their respective fields.</span></p> <p><span>McConnell's piece summarizes some experiments with tiny primitive creatures called planarians, or flatworms, that he has published in his own journal, <i>The Worm Runner's Guide,</i> and elsewhere.  His work, which has been confirmed by only some of the researchers who have tried to duplicate his expermiments, suggests that memory storage is in some way related to RNA, the gigantic molecule which is also involved in cell reproduction.  He exploited the remarkable regenerative powers of the planarian to demonstrate that both halves of a bisected worm will contract in the presence of light if the worm has been so conditioned before the operation is performed.  In his words, \"The mystery was--and still is--how the tails could remember anything.  When the flatworm was cut in half, the head portion retained the brain and the bulk of the nervous system...  Yet many of the tails showed almost perfect retention of the original training!\"  In an even more bizarre experiment, conditioned worms were chopped-up and fed to untrained cannibal worms, who subsequently responded to the light stimulus to an impressive degree.  McConnell concludes that memory must be stored <i>within</i> rather than between cells, and that it must be chemical in nature.</span></p> <p><span>Jencks seeks to refute those who reflexively debunk the ability of computers to do more than chemical data processing.  \"Electronic intelligence,\" he says, \"is still mostly promise rather than performance, but it has already begun to reflect something of the workings of the mind.\"  He looks forward to a generation of computers that will be able to <i>understand</i> the written word, locate consistencies, and follow inferences.  Like McConnell's tentative conclusions, Jencks' predictions strongly suggest that a vitalistic view of the operations of the mind soon may no longer be tenable.  If the functioning of the mind can be understood in substantial detail, and if, in fact, man is able to construct a kind of para-mind, then endeavours such as sociology and history may find their usefulness greatly decreased.</span></p> <p><span>It is to such important problems as these that the other four articles are addressed.  In \"The Death of Dualism,\" Alfred L. Goldberg '63 reminds us that \"The admission that mind is a <i>biological</i> phenomenon arising from the operation of the brain and explainable in physical terms hurts our species and personal pride.  Yet self-indulgent notions of mind have already suffered many setbacks.\"  He sees no obstacles to a completely mechanistic understanding of thought and action and feels that a descriptive behavioral approach is only useful as long as the response of the organism at the neurological level is not understood.  On this question he fundamentally disagrees with Jocl E. Cohen '64-4 and Richard H. Schuster who wrote, respectively, \"Love in a Test Tube\"--an inexcusably irrelevant title--and \"Psychophysiology and the Science of Behavior.\"</span></p> <p><span>Cohen \"argues for the legitimacy of many avenues to the understanding of mind and behavior.\"  Gross analysis is useful, he believes, because \"Only at the social level, most likely, can the many isolated models of diverse social phenomena be related and integrated into coherent social theory.\"  Schuster agrees, but only because he cannot imagine any systematic way to monitor the environmental inputs which induce neurophysiological response.  \"If we know physiology,\" he says, \"but do not know specific inputs, we know how a subject learns a response in general; with behavioral science we can-know how the organism has acquired each and every specific response.\"  The disagreement, then, is not about the world of the future, but merely about the place of descriptive social science in that world.</span></p> <p><span>Weil and his colleagues are to be congratulated for a sophisticated and balanced treatment of a subject which to their knowledge and mine has never before been recognized as a discreet \"field.\"  There is indeed a New Psychology in the offing--a psychology which can only glorify rather than diminish the stature of man's mind.  Those who are concerned to preserve the sentiment of Wonder have no cause for concern, for there is as much to wonder at in the marvelous mental mechanisms that are only now becoming clear as in all the works of art and literature that human reason and emotion have produced.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Law Professor Urges Decision in Rail Fight | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The present railroad labor-management dispute is a situation in which all the solutions are equally unpleasant, Phillip E. Areeda, professor of Law, said yesterday.</span></p> <p><span>Areeda explained that the possible solutions of the five year old battle over rail work rules were either a compromise settlement, a surrender of one side or the other, a strike, or a Congressional resolution.  The argument over which of these solutions to settle on, said Areeda, was basically a question of whether the country wants the freedom of collective bargaining in so vital an industry or not.</span></p> <p><span>In such a situation, the country must come to an immediate decision, said Areeda.  But, he said, in emergency strike situations, this country has historically been unwilling to make the choice necessary to get out of the dilemma.</span></p> <p><span>At odds in the present dispute are the \"minor issues.\"  These include the complicated wage structure, road and yard work, overtime pay, and holiday pay, President Johnson will try to bring the labor and management officials into agreement on these issues in the next 15 days.</span></p> <p><span>Areeda traced the rail conflict to technological change in the 30's coupled with shrinkage in the volume of railroad business.  If the rail business had expended at the same rate as the economy, he said, the technological changes would not have eliminated the need for labor.</span></p> <p><span><b>Work Rules Not Issue in 30's</b></span></p> <p><span>Areeda also said that during these technological changes the unions wanted to preserve jobs while the railroads were prosperous enough so that the management did not make an issue of the work rules.</span></p> <p><span>Paul W. Cherington, professor of Business Administration at the Business School, said that \"Johnson took the only course open to him.\"  About 50,000 railroad workers, he said, would inevitably lose their jobs, perhaps in the matter of a few years.</span></p> <p><span>The union's selective strike against the Illinois Central was, Cherington said, a surprise move to force the railroads to back down one by one.  However, the railroads saw through the move and enforced their version of the minor issue effective Friday morning, thus causing the strike threat.</span></p> <p><span>Mark DeWolfe Howe, professor of Law, said that Johnson's actions in the dispute were \"fine as long as they kept the trains moving.\"  He said that \"union featherbedding has reached outrageous proportions at a time when the railroads really cannot afford it.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Senate to Debate College Tax Credit | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The Senate will begin debate this afternoon on a proposal of Sen. Abraham A. Ribicoff (D-Conn.) to extend special tax credits to parents with children in college.</span></p> <p><span>Defeated by a 10-7 vote in the Senate Finance Committee, the Ribicoff proposal would allow up to $325 a year for each student enrolled in college.  Credits would be granted on a sliding scale to cover the actual cost to the parents of tuition, fees, and books.</span></p> <p><span><b>Debate Agreed To</b></span></p> <p><span>Despite the Committee decision, the Senate agreed by unanimous consent Friday to debate the bill for no more than five hours today and to vote on the measure Tuesday after a maximum of one hour debate.</span></p> <p><span>The special credit is being offered as an amendment to the Administration's tax bill, which emerged from Sen. Harry Byrd's (D-Va.) Finance Committee last week.  It does not appear in the House version of the bill, passed last fall.</span></p> <p><span>Although an interesting collection of senators may finally vote for the bill, strong Administration opposition is expected to defeat it.  If passed, the bill would result in a revenue loss of up to $800 million next year and an estimated $1.3 billion by 1970.</span></p> <p><span>The Johnson Administration, which has pledged itself to cut taxes and the existing deficit in the budget, reportedly feels that the Ribicoff proposal would upset its very delicate budget projections.</span></p> <p><span><b>Fears Budget Upset</b></span></p> <p><span>Even if the Senate does approve it, the measure faces a bleak future in the House, where it would have to win the approval or at least the consent of Rep. Wilbur D. Mills (D-Ark.).  Mills has traditionally opposed similar bills, and the House in general lacks enthusiasm for any fiscal measure initiated in the Senate.</span></p> <p><span>Still, the amendment is not yet dead.  Last year, when Sen. Thomas J. Dodd (D-Conn.) and several other senators pushed for a more generous tax credit or some form of tax exemption for college expenses, opponents demanded that any action taken be part of a general tax bill.</span></p> <p><span>Now it is being considered in that light, but the opposition is claiming that insufficient attention has been given to the bill.  There have not been any hearings on this particular measure.</span></p> <p><span>In the past there has been some debate about what form any tax relief should take.  Dodd proposed an outright exemption of $1200, but Sen. Hubert Humphrey (D-Minn.) has been favoring a tax credit, which permits the parent to deduct a specified amount from his, tax bill.  It is argued that credit will be of more assistance to persons of low income than the exemption.</span></p> <p><span><b>Johnson Favored Guarantees</b></span></p> <p><span>While a senator, Lyndon Johnson favored still another form of assistance, and this may yet be considered.  Johnson, in 1960, put a bill in the Senate hopper asking the Federal government to guarantee private loans taken to finance college costs.  Similar to FHA loans in principle, this system would release more private funds for education without significant cost to the government.</span></p> <p><span>Even though the Administration is openly hostile to the Ribicoff amendment, a spokesman for Sen. Humphrey said yesterday that Humphrey, the Senate Assistant Majority Leader, probably would vote for the bill.</span></p> <p><span>Other liberal senators, reasoning as Sen. Eugene McCarthy (D-Minn.) did last year that the advantages of exemptions and credits could be given as profitably to parents as well as to business, may join Ribicoff and Humphrey on Tuesday.</span></p> <p><span><b>Dirksen Reported Opposed</b></span></p> <p><span>While Republican leader Sen. Everett Dirksen (R-III.) is reportedly opposed, Republican opposition may not be unanimous.  Conservatives, particularly Sens. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.) and Peter Dominick (R-Colo.), put similar, though more generous, bills in the hopper last session.  These men have claimed tax credit is a \"means for encouraging more effort at the private level\" and therefore more healthy than direct Federal aid.</span></p> <p><span>The Ribicoff amendment would allow 75 per cent credit on the first $200 of college costs, 25 per cent on the next $300 and 10 per cent on the next $1000, making a maximum exemption of $325 dollars on costs of $1500 or more.  Credit would be reduced by $50 for every $5000 of income over $25,000 and would be denied altogether when gross adjusted family income exceeds $57,500.  Credits could be claimed for each child in college under the Ribicoff bill.</span></p> <p><span>According to one Senate source, the vote may be close, but Ribicoff is not expected to offer a smaller credit to win additional votes</span></p>"}
{"title": "'THE GREATEST' STOPS SONNY LISTON IN SEVEN | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>All the crow in China wouldn't be enough to satisfy the appetites of the cognoscenti of the boxing world tonight as young Cassius Marcellus Clay demolished the legend of Sonny Liston with a seven-round TKO.</span></p> <p><span>The stolid, power-punching Liston threw in the proverbial towel before round seven began; Sonny suffered a probable shoulder fracture sometime during those six rounds.</span></p> <p><span>Liston claims the injury occurred in Round One.  Although the champ was not noticeably crippled until the fourth or fifth, Cassius Clay undoubtedly won his crown from a disabled Sonny Liston.</span></p> <p><span>Despite Liston's injury, Clay's victory was no fluke; the quick and classy Clay was more than a match for Liston.  He obviously carried rounds one, four and six with a combination of dazzling footwork, and a hall of deceptive jabs.</span></p> <p><span>Close to the canvas himself in the third and seemingly helpless in the fifth, Clay entered the sixth round obviously stronger than the 31 (sic)-year-old Liston.  Clay was never hit with the full impact of Liston's awesome left hook, but he withstood considerable punishment and retained the speed and deceptivenss which rendered Liston sluggish and frustrated by the sixth.</span></p> <p><span>In Round One Cassius was a dancing master, ducking, slipping and backing away from a barrage of Liston lefts.  Gloves near his waist, Clay seemed to be taunting Sonny to connect; Sonny never did.  Sometime during this first round Liston claims to have injured his shoulder trying to block a Clay punch; it was not apparent to the viewers.  Liston stalked Clay from the moment the bell sounded, connecting with hard shots to the body, but more often missing with ferocious jabs.  Clay scored with a volley of six punches to Sonny's head and capped them with a sharp right and left.  The round was Clay's.</span></p> <p><span><b>Liston Wins Round</b></span></p> <p><span>The second round saw a more poised and potent Liston, who landed an assortment of jabs and hooks and finally battered bobbing and weaving Clay to the ropes with crushing blows to the body.  The round was Liston's.</span></p> <p><span>Clay opened Round Three with a damaging flurry of punches which opened a deep gash under the champ's left eye.  Fully aroused by Clay's audacity and perhaps remembering that this was the round he had chosen for the KO, Liston tore fato Clay with a vicious array of blows.  Sonny landed a left and a right to the body, a hard left to the jaw and followed this with a rare right uppercut.  The third round was the only one in which Liston displayed the lethal effectiveness of his Patterson triumphs.  That he did not lay Cassius low in the third provides some substance to Liston's contention that his left arm was already badly injured.  Crippled or not, Sonny obviously took the round.</span></p> <p><span>Those of us who were expecting Sonny to flatten Clay in four were rudely surprised when a vigorous and confident Cassius answered the fourth round bell.  Advancing against Liston for the first time in the fight, Cassius began to dominate the action with stinging left jabs thrown from every angle.  Liston delivered a solid left and right to the jaw, but the punches dented neither Clay's jaw nor his confidence.  Liston was plodding by the end of the round; Clay was faster than ever.  Round to Clay.</span></p> <p><span>Round Five may always remain a questionmark.  An apparently sightless Clay, who has alternately claimed that he was gouged by the champion's thumb and blinded by liniment on Sonny's gloves, managed to hold off the lumbering Liston with no more protection than a stiff left arm.  Liston landed ponderous hooks to Clay's body and head but their lack of visible effect made the spectators wonder for the first time whether there was indeed something wrong with the champ.  Clay seemed to recover his sight late in the round, but the round was Liston's.</span></p> <p><span><b>Cassius Wins Round</b></span></p> <p><span>The bell sounded for Round Six.  Clay was now stalking Liston.  The challenger was moving in and out at will, snapping solid blows to body and head.  Clay's shots were annoying Liston more than hurting him, but without his left, the big gun in Sonny's arsenal, the Liston attack was limited to a few weak jabs and an occasional right.  Clay won the sixth practically by default.</span></p> <p><span>As the bell rang for the seventh the crowd was treated to the sight of Cassius dancing to the center of the ring in a comic display of shadow-boxing.  Liston sat sullenly in his corner as doctors and trainers hovered over him.  For a moment it was not clear what had happened.  Then, suddenly, Cassius leaped into the air, arms raised, screaming like a madman, \"I won, I won, I won, I am the greatest, greatest, greatest.\"  Jack Nilon, Liston's manager, had stopped the fight.  Nilon later explained that the injury to Liston's left shoulder in the first round had become progressively worse with each round until, in the sixth, Sonny could not even raise his left arm.  \"There was nothing to do but stop the fight.  Sonny was simply defenseless,\" said Nilon.</span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile, back in the ring, Cassius was extolling his greatness to a still disbelieving world.  \"Eat your words,\" Clay howled at the shaken sportswriters.  \"Liston is in the hospital and here I am, still pretty as can be.  That big bear was an amateur.  He was scared of me.  He couldn't even hit me when I was half blind.  If he wants to fight me he will have to work his way up.  I can beat any fighter in the world.  I am the greatest.  I am the prettiest.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>Clay Expounds</b></span></p> <p><span>Flanked by his spiritual adviser, Bundini Brown, the new champion and sometime Black Muslim revealed that God was getting credit for the victory.  \"I have been talking to God,\" Clay said.  \"I know the only God.\"</span></p> <p><span>Like the Dempsey-Tunney long count and Jack Johnson's infamous dive against Jess Willard, this Liston-Clay fight will remain a subject of continuing controversy.  Could a healthy Sonny Liston have made good his promise to cool Cassius in rounds two or three?  This question can only be answered by a rematch.</span></p> <p><span>One thing is certain.  Cassius Clay deserved better than 7-1 odds for this fight.  The gash on Liston's face and the dislocated shoulder prove that Cassius is not the impotent puncher that his critics had labeled him.  If Cassius showed that he can hand out some punishment, his weathering of Liston's third round attack also proved that he can take it.  Clay has been maintaining for some time that he is the fastest heavyweight ever.  Few would doubt him now.</span></p> <p><span>Clay's defeat of Liston by no means makes him the greatest heavyweight ever.  I suppose he is the prettiest.</span></p>"}
{"title": "BILLY GRAHAM | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>To the Editors of the CRIMSON:</span></p> <p><span>Billy Graham was with us last week and it was a pleasure to have him in the Harvard community.  Yet I think it, should be clearly understood that he does not represent Protestant thinking and speaks only for himself.  I say this because personally I have always felt that Dr. Graham combines a most appealing sincerity with an incredible understanding of Christian thought and theology.  I say incredible because I don't know of any reputable Protestant seminary that teaches the kind of theology that he represented here last week.</span></p> <p><span>For one thing, I am troubled by his insistence that the Bible was a kind of magical authority.  His oft-repeated statement, \"The Bible says,\" leaves the impression that a simple reading of the scriptures will provide all the answers to life.  Never a word is said about biblical criticism or the contemporary understanding of textual material.  In the matter of authority, the teachings of the Church or the development of theology are never mentioned.  Billy Graham gives to the Bible a kind of authority that would make even Martin Luther uncomfortable.</span></p> <p><span>I am also troubled by the insistence on instant decision for Christ.  As a young faculty friend of mine remarked to me at one of the Burr B sessions, \"Dr. Graham makes a sacrament out of the decision for Christ.\"  It becomes immediately apparent that there is no other way to religious commitment and any other pilgrimage is unacceptable.  By any standards, this is a gross distortion of the nature of Christian commitment.</span></p> <p><span>But my principal criticism of Dr. Graham is the oversimplification of the gospel which makes his pronouncements about contemporary social issues practically worthless.  For example, I waited all week long to hear what he would say about two important issues on the campus today:  race and sexual morality.  Concerning the race question, he said that we should change our hearts and was critical of demonstrations.  And to the Boston press he made the statement that there was more genuine understanding of the race issue in the south than in the north.  But never a discussion of the meaning of social justice or a serious grappling with the roots of prejudice.  As for sexual morality, he offered a re-affirmation of the commandment, \"Thou shalt not commit adultery.\"  I kept wondering if he felt that adultery was the issue on college campuses.  Nothing whatsoever was said about what is happening to human beings in our world and of the moral dilemmas that face every one of us.</span></p> <p><span>As one of the CRIMSON editors noted last week, Billy Graham and Barry Goldwater have more in common than their initials.  Interestingly enough, their appeal is often to the same people.  A great many Americans want their religion like their politics to be simple and \"from the heart.\"  We can admire Billy Graham's warmth, but let's not confuse his message with the historic understanding of the Faith. <b>Rev.

The tone of Marlowe's two-part <i>Tamburlaine</i> is almost uninterruptedly bombastic; what scant relief there is comes from the DcMille-like spectacles of battles, suicides, and a scene in which Tamburlaine's chariot is drawn by four captive kings.</span></p> <p><span>By staging a concert reading of <i>Tamburlaine,</i> Seltzer robbed himself of the visual splendor and seemed to sentence his audiences to a few hours of exposure to almost constant shouting.  But heavy cutting of Marlowe's lines, some clever technical effects, and a splendid reading by David Stone as Tamburlaine almost make this production first-rate theatre.</span></p> <p><span>All the production's strengths, however, cannot offset the play's weakness.  Despite the prodigious cuts, a number of almost-identical scenes in which assorted rival kings condemn Tamburlaine to assorted dooms make the reading drag horribly.</span></p> <p><span>Sloppy performances in several small parts do not help either, and these minor shoddinesses are particularly embarrassing in <i>Tamburlaine.</i>  The play's ranting scenes are so close to being ridiculous that even a minor gaffe can make the audience explode with laughter.  When Neil Johnson makes the emperor Callapine look and sound like Richard Nixon (leaning forward, shoulders hunched, slurring words like \"mah empahr\") or when Percy Granger as a lord assigned to protect Queen Zenocrate, gives her up to Tamburlaine (\"We yield unto the, happy Tamburlaine\"), in a voice that sounds like a public-address system announcer's, the play breaks down completely for a moment.</span></p> <p><span>The smaller roles have almost all been shortened considerably; few characters have time to make any impression on the stage.  Instead they seem to melt into choruses behind Tamburlaine, enemies foretelling his downfall, counsellors feeding his ego.  Once in a while a reader stands out from the faceless crowd--Dean Gitter as Cosroe and Phillip Hecksher as Techelles bring some life to their parts.  A few of the 42 parts are also noticeably bad; Richard Backus races through the brief prologue at breakneck speed and Jeremiah Tower seems to feel that Mycetes must be made monotonous in order to show that he is weak.  But the lines become so repetitious that the characters for the most part float by unnoticed.</span></p> <p><span>David Stone tackles the role of Tamburlaine with marvelous common sense.  Since he does not have to act, he is freed from the gesturing and stamping about the stage that are usually used to underscore Tamburlaine's noisy speeches.  He keeps his face almost expressionless through most of the production, and reads his lines with all the restraint possible.  He still can't tone the speeches down quite enough; there is simply too much noise and it tires the listener after awhile.  But except in his utterly unconvincing expressions of love for Zenocrate during the first act, Stone's vocal explosions never seem unnatural.</span></p> <p><span>Frances Gitter as Zenocrate starts slowly, making no effort to smooth the queen's sudden transformation from hatred of Tamburlaine to love for him.  This particular roughness is largely Marlowe's fault; as the play moves along, Miss Gitter's acting gets smoother.  In her death scene, the production reaches its climax.  Stone's outbursts of emotion and Miss Gitter's lovely reading are supplemented by some dazzling work with the lighting by David Levine.</span></p> <p><span>The death scene, like several other emotion-ridden moments, is set up by a quiet conversation that precedes it.  In fact Basil Ashmore, who cut the two full-length parts of <i>Tamburlaine</i> into a two-and-a-half-hour show, retained most of the play's quieter moments while cutting back on the noise.  The changes he has worked are radical; Bajazeth and Zabina disappear from part one, the Christian kings and their Muslim allies form part two.  Almost all the battle scenes are excised, and so, unfortunately, are some important parts of Zenocrate's role.  It is inevitable that much is lost in the cutting, but Ashmore might have used his blue pencil more heavily on some of the kings-prophesy.  Tamburlaine's downfall scenes.</span></p> <p><span>With some of the roughness worked out--and Seltzer might start by asking his bit actors to stand still when they are not speaking, and not to shuffle their feet, fidget with their hands, or bite their nails--<i>Tamburlaine</i> should be even better at tonight's second performance.  Considering its problems, this first reading was a good one; the Loeb's festival has started well.</span></p>"}

Avoiding the rhetoric of the book, Harrington carefully outlined the \"problems of at least 40 million impoverished Americans\" to an audience of about 100.</span></p> <p><span>When he discussed the various justifications of a war on poverty, for instance, Harrington glossed over the traditional \"brotherhood\" arguments, and gave more considerable time to the \"cash-and-carry\" argument.  In the long run, he said, it will probably be much cheaper to abolish poverty than to continue maintaining it with government funds.</span></p> <p><span>Harringon prefaced his remarks with a statement of \"guarded optimism,\" but he spent most of the evening in discussing those aspects of poverty in the United States about which he finds it \"very hard to be optimistic.\"</span></p> <p><span>The outspoken author began by sketching both his definitions and the dimensions of poverty in this country.  Harrington defined a poor person as one who has a \"multiplicity of miseries, each of which reinforces the other.\"  Within that definition, he mentioned jobs, housing and education as three of the most recurrent problems of the poor.</span></p> <p><span>\"Full employment is a precondition to an unconditional 'War on Poverty',\" Harrington said, \"for without it, we may only recruit more and more people to the ranks of the poor.\"</span></p> <p><span>Unless more jobs, more housing, and more education are provided, Harrington continued, \"poverty may create social chaos, and it may lead to a very violent and explosive sort of situation.\"</span></p> <p><span>Much more comprehensive solutions and programs than those of President Johnson are needed, Harrington said.  First of all, he said, the government must realize that the \"War\" will be \"won or lost in Washington D.C., not with a grass roots movement.\"  Secondly, the public sector must be extended, primarily because the private sector is not generating jobs.  Finally, he said, \"we must begin to redistribute the wealth of this country\" by \"having social planning on a national level for decent purposes.\"</span></p>"}

Rockefeller organizers were reportedly worried that if a second or third ballot were held.  Goldwater might pick up the few voted he seeded to win.</span></p> <p><span>Wellesley College officials had forbidden the meeting the use of the Convention Hall after 5 p.m.  At exactly 5:02 p.m. campus police shut off the lights and public address system.

{"title": "Seven Days in May | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>I have always had the feeling there was once a distinction between propaganda and art--maybe there never was.  Art contains nuances which artists, struggling against the limitations of their medium, try to make comprehensible.  Propaganda, however, denies that individual nuances make a call for political action impossible.  Propaganda is the work of men who <i>believe:</i>  it suggests action can solve the questions artists leave unanswered.  So propaganda films become modern morality plays:  the actors are vices and virtues incarnate.</span></p> <p><span>But if you consider propaganda tolerable provided it's your brand, \"Seven Days in May\" is enjoyable.  When the story begins, Frederic March, as President of the United States, has signed a disarmament treaty with the Russians.  Despite unemployment from disbanded defense industries and the wide-spread unpopularity of the treaty, President March sticks grimly to his decision.  \"Eventually we would have blown each other up,\" he philosophizes.</span></p> <p><span>Burt Lancaster, the villain, is a demagogic Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with a large following at V.F.W. posts across the country.  Lancaster is convinced that President Marsh is taking the country to Hell.  His aide, Kirk Douglas, does not like the disarmament treaty any more than General Lancaster.  But when he discovers that Lancaster is planning a military coup, he is caught between respect for military discipline and his belief in the principles of the Constitution.  The principles of the Constitution win out:  Douglas tells President March what Lancaster is planning.</span></p> <p><span>The ensuing contest is exciting and ideologically correct throughout.  For example, the film has a civil rights tinge.  The producer has dutifully used Negroes in minor roles wherever he deemed it appropriate.  A Negro in the Pentagon running an automatic door receives a good deal of film footage.  Negroes sit in the airports.  They march in the pro and anti-treaty lines before the White House.  Finally, there are Negroes at the President's press conference as the film closes.  These are simply kowtows to the <i>New Republic</i> set; if the producer had real guts he could have cast Sydney Poitier in Kirk Douglas' role.  But then Producer Edward Lewis would have been troubled by the script's implication that Douglas will some day sleep with Ava Gardner, who plays Lancaster's former mistress.  Miscegenation might have confused the good guys and the bad guys, particularly for southern audiences.  Anything that controversial would have detracted from the film's propaganda force.</span></p> <p><span>The nicest thing about \"Seven Days\" is its realism.  President March looks like a cross between Eisen-hower and Johnson; he acts like a Stevenson-Kennedy who talks like Truman.  Then there are great shots of aircraft carriers, Sabre jets, and neat armored half-tracks that soldiers drive like ponies in an old-fashioned Western.</span></p> <p><span>\"Seven Days in May\" advertises melodramatically the danger Producer Lewis foresees and fears.  It's a movie out to prove a point; as a result, the characters are all uncomfortably stereotyped.  Kirk Douglas does not struggle with personal weaknesses, hate, or pride.  Instead, his moral uprightness must choose between military honor and country.  The alternatives are black and white, so no interesting doubt exists about the decision he will make.  The film is no artistic study of emotions, but a coarse defense of an excellent cold war position.  As such, it is fun to watch Hollywood translating the peace ethic into a popular idiom.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Bill Higgs | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Eight years ago Mississipian Bill Higgs graduated from Harvard Law School with modest grades, unpretentious ambitions, and an unshaken faith in racism.  He served an Army stint and disappeared quietly into a Jackson, Mississippi law practice.  Today he is one of Washington's most militant lobbyists for integration, an attorney for SNCC, and the author of several titles of the present civil rights bill.  As his close friend, Roy Wilkins, noted here last week:  \"When a Southerner changes, he's very thorough about it.\"</span></p> <p><span>Higgs was in Cambridge last week, interviewing students for his project in Washington this summer.  Inevitably the interview degenerates into a tug of war with Higgs carefully outlining his work and the student anxiously trying to probe the bizarre details of this man's history.  The student usually lost, for Higgs is reticent about his past, and his \"conversion\" has left no visible scars.  Still the complete Southern gentleman, he drawls softly and easily, smiles often, listens courteously--with apparent interest--to any argument, and seems incapable of anger or depression.  His 6 feet, 3 inch frame moves with an awkward rural grace, out of place, and charming, in both the halls of Congress and the dining room of Leverett House.  The aloof informality suggests anything but a stormy past.</span></p> <p><span>Higgs gave little thought to the race issue before 1959; that year, in fact, he ran for the legislature as a \"stauch segregationist.\"  However, at that time he also began accepting Negro clients \"out of curiosity.\"  \"They came to me beaten, their eyes knocked out, their land stolen.  I found that there was no remedy in the courts or in politics.  I began to investigate my beliefs.\"</span></p> <p><span>The step from investigation to action was a quick one.  Early in 1961 Higgs was approached by a young Negro wearing a purple shirt, leather jacket, sunglasses, and a determined frown.  \"You've spoken well of us, Mr. Higgs, but we've all heard enough talk.  I plan to enter Ole Miss this year.  Help me.\"  The lawyer agreed, and eighteen months later James Meredith walked on to the Oxford campus.</span></p> <p><span>Higgs soon received prestigious civil liberties awards in New York and Los Angeles--and death threats from the sheriff's office in Clarksdale, Mississippi.  His parents began to receive endless insults from town folk and economic intimidation from local grocers.  Finally, early last year, the Jackson District Attorney told him to expect \"unlimited jailings\" upon returning to the state.</span></p> <p><span>Understandably, Higgs has not returned and won't \"until the state undergoes a major political revolution--Negroes in all levels and offices, submitting rights bills of their own in Congress.\"  When asked how long this will be, Higgs frowns pensively, rubs his chin, and drawls slowly, \"two years maybe less . . . it will probably take total Federal occupation, of course.\"  This penchant for precise numerical prediction is most interesting when focused on the civil rights bill, for Higgs has displayed an incredible touch for Washington politics.  Last summer he and several law students drew up an \"ideal\" civil rights bill, which seasoned observers ridiculed as utopian.  Last month the bulk of that bill sailed through the House without a hitch.  Higgs had picked his allies cannily, cultivating the friendship of Democratic Congressman Corman and Congressmen McCulloch and Lindsay of the GOP.</span></p> <p><span>And in the Senate?  \"Perhaps it's the giddiness of victory, but I say three-to-two for passage of the whole thing and three-to-one that all the big titles stay.\"  When reminded that the New York Times is more pessimistic, Higgs laughs:  \"The trouble with Harvard is that everyone here reads the <i>Times,</i> and it hasn't been right about this bill yet.\"</span></p> <p><span>Higgs' enthusiasm often races beyond enactment to enforcement of the bill, which will be the focus of his program this summer.  \"We must force the President to prove his liberalism, to fish or cut bait.\"  Higgs fears Johnson will make an election-year deal with the Southern Senators on the enforcement issue, and the prospect infuriates him.  In discussing it, his drawl tightens, the words shooting out singly and passionately; he is no longer the patient, understanding lobbyist.  Before catching himself, and smiling at his anger, Higgs reveals both the pain and power of his commitment.  His beliefs exiled him, but only by putting them into practice can he return home.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Lodge for President? | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Almost like a game of cards in which everyone gets his chance, the national press periodically throws its deceptive spotlight on another of the so-called Republican compromise candidates for President:  first, Michigan's George Romney; then reliable standby Dick Nixon; and recently Pennsylvania's Bill Scranton.  The beam has now settled on Henry Cabot Lodge, ambassador to Vietnam.</span></p> <p><span>The ray of light which helped boost Lodge to the front of the stage is a <i>Newsweek</i> pool of New Hampshire Republicans which shows him to be the \"most popular candidate by far.\"  While pollster Lou Harris notes that Lodge will suffer in tomorrow's primary because he is a write-in candidate, the ambassador's undeniable popularity and an unconfirmed report that he is an official candidate for the nomination have boosted speculation about the seriousness of his challenge.</span></p> <p><span>Lodge's list of assets is an impressive one.  In a campaign which undoubtedly will be dominated--if the Republicans have their way--by foreign affairs, he has a distinguished record.  His appointment to the south Vietnamese post by President Kennedy was, in effect, a bipartisan recognition of this fact.  And few will forget his highly successful years as ambassador to the United Nations.</span></p> <p><span>In addition to his expertise in the foreign sphere, Lodge can claim a wide range of experience in domestic affairs.  He was elected to three terms in the Senate, serving a total of 13 years.  Before that he sat in the Massachusetts State Legislature for two terms.  This full spectrum of experience would make him a tougher opponent for Johnson than some of the other possible nominees, like Scranton, for instance.</span></p> <p><span>There are other important credits in Lodge's account.  He looks like a president:  his vigorous, dignified manner easily inspires confidence.  He is considered very close to former President Eisenhower.  (Lodge was instrumental in convincing Ike to run in '52 and then in helping run his campaign.)  Ike's active support in '64 could be a decisive factor if the Republicans seriously think they can win.</span></p> <p><span>His close relationship with Ike and his place on the 1960 ticket as vice-presidential nominee would seem to fit Lodge nicely into the role of compromise candidate.  To effect a real compromise between the so-called extreme \"liberalism\" of Rockefeller and the extreme \"conservatism\" of Goldwater is almost indispensable for a Republican victory.  Can Lodge, who has been aloof from most ideological haggles since 1960, best accomplish this binding?  Or is real unification an unobtainable fiction?</span></p> <p><span>The ambassador is not without his weakness.  His very presence in South Vietnam limits his ability to criticize Democratic policies in South-east Asia.  And despite his terms in the Senate, he has not recently stood out on most domestic issues.  so far, his policy positions are question marks.  Lodge <i>was</i> a part of the losing team in 1960, although he was not damaged as much as Nixon.  Finally, a crucial enigma remains:  can Lodge engineer and sustain a presidential campaign to compare with the vigorous offensive that President Johnson is certain to mount?</span></p> <p><span>Only if he returns to the United States can Lodge answer this question, as well as others which will be asked by the party professionals:  How does he stand on key domestic issues?  How expertly is he able to combine liberal and conservative forces?  How widespread really is his popularity?</span></p> <p><span>If Henry Cabot Lodge wants the Republican nomination, he will have to come home and get it.  A Draft Lodge movement, as it now exists, just isn't enough.  the party professionals aren't likely to pass over such available and willing candidates as Dick Nixon or Bill Scranton for a tight-mouthed ambassador sitting 6,000 miles away in Saigon.</span></p>"}

And even for the spectators who came for the blood and the KO's, the spectacle could hardly have been satisfying.</span></p> <p><span>The only real excitement of the afternoon was Owen Hanley's upset victory over defending 145-pound champion Jack D'Arcy.  Hanley's strategy of measured retreat, quick jabs, sharp counterpunching, and effective clinching was the smart man's answer to the D'Arcy attack.</span></p> <p><span>D'Arcy, anxious to throw his strong right hook, consistently held it too low to provide adequate defense against Hanley's jabs which bloodied D'Arcy's face by the second round.  Hanley's face-high fists served to block most of D'Arcy's blows, while the champ failed to punch to Hanley's vulnerable body.</span></p> <p><span>D'Arcy was constantly on the offensive, but his blows tended to be wild and inflicted little damage for most of the fight.  In the third and last round D'Arcy finally landed some hard hooks to the body and head and a sharp uppercut to the face, but the barrage came too late.  Hanley had carried rounds one and two on points.</span></p> <p><span>In the 155-pound class, hard-punching Art Campbell took a controversial decision from a faster-moving Kim Johnson.  In a slow first round Johnson displayed a hard left jab but failed to throw it with any regularity.  Campbell landed a few strong combinations to the body.</span></p> <p><span>Johnson opened round two with more sharp jabbing, but sometime in mid-round he made the mistake of abandoning the jab-and-retreat tactics for a frontal assault that cost him the round.  The stronger Campbell took a few of Johnson's punches and then countered with a hail of powerful hooks and uppercuts that battered Johnson into the ropes.</span></p> <p><span>In round three Johnson came back with a dazzling series of stacatto jabs that rendered Campbell ineffective and drew enthusiastic approval from the crowd.  The decision was by no means obvious.</span></p> <p><span>Dick Szum in the 165-pound class contributed the only total demolition job of the day by pounding a game Todd Cobey to the canvass three times in the first round for a TKO victory.</span></p> <p><span>Ten seconds after the first round began, Szum landed his first punch, a fearsome right hook to Cobey's left temple.  Obviously stunned by the impact, Cobey could offer little resistance as Szum swarmed in with a series of clubbing rights and lefts that floored his opponent.</span></p> <p><span>The fearless, but hapless Cobey arose only to fall again under a rain of upper-cuts.  This time Cobey not only stood up, but he also fought back.  Instead of jabbing and retreating, however, Cobey abandoned defenses and tried to trade punches.  It was an unfavorable exchange for Cobey who was decked for the third time.  The referee then stopped the fight</span></p>"}
{"title": "Michael Harrington | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Michael Harrington, the author of <i>The Other America,</i> has at least a dozen sides to his personality.  When he spoke at Winthrop House Sunday night, Harrington discussed poverty with a business-like precision, mixing a surprising realism with his energetic, crusading determination.  Afterwards, in private, he was personable and easy-going, full of jokes and boyish charm.  Throughout the evening, Harrington seemed entirely befuddled by his recent success.</span></p> <p><span>No matter where he is, Harrington never lets you forget that he is a socialist iconoclast.  His speech is spiced with phrases like \"our quaint little economic system,\" \"the good ol\" American grass-roots system,\" and \"pinch-penny politics.\"  With tongue in check, he mentions \"Barry Goldwater socialists\"; a second later, he lashes out at the \"great many people who profit from poverty in the United States.\"  Always, he thinks in terms of an established structure which dominates not only politics, but all American society.  \"There is considerable institutional resistance to the 'War against Poverty.'  The opposition is tenacious, but their power has to be broken.\"</span></p> <p><span>Above all, Harrington insists on using public money to combat poverty.  He calls the recently enacted tax-cut bill \"the most minimal conceivable band-aid,\" and accuses the conservatives in Congress of devising the \"most reactionary possible version of a good idea.\"  The private sector, Harrington says, is just not generating any new jobs, and Washington has yet to realize this.</span></p> <p><span>But Harrington is not just a social critic, he is a constructive and imaginative thinker.  The most heartening aspect of his influence on Johnson's \"War on Poverty\" is that he has succeeded outside the political structure.  He is a one-man crusade, conveying an absolute command over every fact, every idea even distantly related to the question of poverty.  He can quote statistic after statistic, book after book, and yet always exude his devotion to solving the problem.  In the discussion period after his speech, Harrington answered questions knowledgeably and realistically.  At the same time he displayed his unmistakable conviction that something must be done at once.  He refuses to reject any idea, no matter how implausible it sounds, until it has been tried.  As an example, Harrington cellent and creative cooks, for instance, could be paid to teach other poor housewives how to use the meager food they receive.  The cooks would get a little much-needed money and the poor would eat better.</span></p> <p><span>Harrington was born in St. Loius in 1929.  He attended Holy Cross and Yale Law School, but left New Haven after a year.  He began writing for the <i>Catholic Worker</i> in the late 1940's, and at some point during his job with the paper, he began to attend Socialist Party meetings regularly.  Since then, he has worked on projects for the Fund for the Republic and written numerous articles for <i>Commonweal.</i></span></p> <p><span>Harrington has been in Europe for the past ten months (he went abroad \"to escape American life\"), and displays a charming sense of humor when he describes the trip.  In Paris, where he studied and wrote, Harrington adopted the innocently beguiling facial expressions of the French.  He loves to tell anecdotes about experiences both here and abroad.  He mentioned, for example, an article written in <i>Pravda</i> on the occasion of the Russian publication of <i>The Other America.</i>  With obvious delight, Harrington quoted sections from the article:  \"Although Mr. Harrington is a bourgeois revisionist, he has portrayed the United States accurately.  His only failing is that he has neglected the importance of the Communist vanguard in supporting the oppressed poor.\"</span></p> <p><span>With the royalties from his book (it has sold at least 80,000 copies and has been translated into French, Polish and Russian), Harrington has retired from his post as editor of the Socialist paper, <i>New America,</i> and is writing a new book on decadence in the lower classes.  Always modest, he says he had no idea that <i>The Other America</i> would be so influential.  When asked if his life is different now that he has become an American <i>cause celebre,</i> Harrington commented only that \"it's a little bit more hectic.\"  Although his dedication to the poor forces him to accept speaking invitations, he appears indifferent to the enthusiasm with which he is greeted.</span></p> <p><span>Harrington will probably continue his personal vandetta against poverty.  He is only in his thirties, but seems oblivious to the pleasures which success might bring.  When he isn't telling stories, discussing politics or literature, Harrington talks about the poor and their problems.  All he can do is smile with frustration when forced to talk of himself.  \"When I applied for a residence permit in France, they actually ushered me past a huge line and took me to the V.I.P.'s window.  They thought I was some sort of celebrity!\"  And then he brushes his short, uncombed hair down over his forehead with an almost embarrassed gesture.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Philip Stern Reveals Income Tax Inequities, Shows Gaping Loopholes | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The principal thing to be said about Philip Stern's book on tax loopholes is that it is a superb popularizaton.  The term \"popularization\" has come to have an overtone of condescension that is often, as in this case, unjust.  A good popularization takes facts or interpretations already known to the experts and makes them comprehensible and interesting to the lay reader.  If the subject dealt with is of any importance, the popularizer performs an invaluable function--war is too important to be left to the generals.</span></p> <p><span>Loopholes in the Federal tax law reduce the revenue flowing into the fisc; thus nominal tax rates must be higher; thus everyone not able to squeeze through the loophole must pay more in taxes:  ergo, tax loopholes are a subject of general importance.  Add to this the intricacy of the Internal Revenue Code and, to heap Pelion upon Ossa, the mind boggling complexities of the Regulations under that Code, and one has an area of expertise ripe for popularization.</span></p> <p><span>The inequities Mr. Stern describes are well known to those familiar with the Code.  The favorites of any good tax lawyer--percentage depletion for oil wells and clam shells*, the marital deduction, capital gains treatment for raisers of cattle and Christmas trees, stock options, and those marvelous fabrications, the real estate tax shelter and the collapsible corporation--all these are here, all are wittily and accurately dissected, all are outrageous.  There is little more to be said about <i>The Great Treasury Raid;</i> those who are interested should read the book, those who are not will not be brought to do so by anything further I might say.</span></p> <p><span>The book, however, stimulates a general reflection, not directly relevant to its subject.  Federal taxation is a striking example of misrepresentation of the effect of a public policy.  It is widely believed that the income tax is highly progressive and thoroughly soaks those unfortunate enough to be rich.  In fact the tax (after all deductons, exemptions, and special provisions) is only slightly progressive and, indeed, at very high income levels is regressive.  Nevertheless, the voice of the Goldwater is heard in the land.  There are numerous other examples of these myths, spread by the ignorant or by wilful deceivers of the public.</span></p> <p><span>In one of his finest speeches, delivered at a Yale commencement, President Kennedy called for a reexamination of some of these sacred cows of the received wisdom.  In part, his administration began the job.  I wonder how likely it is that President Johnson will go beyond these pre-formulated \"realities\" of public discourse and attempt to reshape the terms in which we discuss public issues to correspond more closely to the under-lying actualities.

The polls varied from day to day; recently they have showed Goldwater and Rockefeller running almost even.</span></p> <p><span>But only three miles outside of Manchester there are high wooded hills criss-crossed with dirt roads that become almost impassable when melting snow turns them to mud.  The pollsters rarely reach the farmers and retired old people who live along these roads.  When a stranger calls to one of them as he wipes the mud off his tractor's engine with a stick, the farmer ambles over to the road's edge, considering the question:  \"I ain't sure, Mister.  I ain't sure I should say even if I was sure.\"</span></p> <p><span>The biggest unknown in today's contest is the number of voters who will write in Lodge's name on the ballot.  If the number is large, the division of moderate voters may pull Rockefeller's total below Goldwater's.  But if citizens heed Rockefeller's plea to \"vote for one of the candidates who has openly declared himself a candidate, and who has traveled in the state to discuss the issues with you,\" then the united moderates may overwhelm the Goldwater backers.</span></p> <p><span>Goldwater, naturally, is praying for a huge Lodge vote.  His prediction that the Ambassador will take second place today (after himself) is probably calculated to ensure that the Ambassador will.  For the same kind of reasons, Goldwater has been saying nice things about Bobby Kennedy.  At a rally Saturday in Concord, he saw a man carrying a sign saying \"OUR PRESIDENT IN SPIRIT LIVES ON:  Carry on with Robert Kennedy.\"  Goldwater pointed to the signs \"It's none of my business, but for New Hampshire Democrats I don't think voting for Bobby Kennedy is a bad idea.  The Attorney General and I are old friends.  I have a great deal of respect for him.\"  Goldwater knows that the more pressure the New Hampshire primary puts on President Johnson to make Kennedy his running-mate, the better his own Southern drawing power will look to delegates at the San Franciso convention.</span></p> <p><span>At the same time, Goldwater has tried to offset the effect of the announcement earlier this month that the California primary is much more important than the New Hampshire contest.  \"Next Tuesday while you are voting,\" he said in Concord, \"I'll be heading a rodco at home.  I'l be riding an old palomino named Sonny--twenty-three years old but she rides better than a rocking chair...\" (Laughter) \"And as I ride down my mainstreet, I want the people in my hometown to point to me and say 'There's the fellah who won so big in New Hampshire.'  That's why next Tuesday is so important to this particular candidate.\"</span></p> <p><span>Finally, Goldwater is playing hard on the Cuba theme:  \"I was born on the Mexican border, and spoke Spanish almost before I spoke English.  I know the Latin American people, and their concern with Cuba.  I know that above all, they love courage and abhor cowardice.  As of now, frankly, they consider us cowards:  they cannot understand why a big country should let itself be pushed around by a little power like this.\"</span></p> <p><span>Speeches like this bring pro-Goldwater audiences to their feet, stamping and screaming themselves hoarse with \"We want Barry.  We want Barry.\"  Nelson Rockefeller's audiences react to their candidate more calmly.  But there is a noticeable difference in the kind of people at Rockefeller's ratties.  In Concord, Goldwaters audience consisted mostly of very old and very young people.  The audience also seemed, by clothes and manners, to be a mixture of those with a great deal of money and those with almost none at all.</span></p> <p><span>At Rockefeller's huge rally in Manchester, the audience was different.  These were people satisfied with the status quo, who merely wanted a Republican status quo in place of a Democratic one.  Barely cosmopolitan enough to accept Rockefeller's divorce, they were pleased by his vague talk of \"taking a stand on the issues.\"  They were not very interested in foreign affairs, and Rockefeller generally avoided the subject.  He mentioned \"crumbling Western alliances\" and \"the leadership gap in Washington.\"</span></p> <p><span>Rockefeller's biggest advantage today is that voters seem tremendously attracted to him personally.  He has fought hard for the nomination, and campaigned more in New Hampshire than any of the other candidates.  Goldwater, on the other hand, strikes one as a tremendously sincere and honest man.  He is very direct about what he stands for, in contrast with Rockefeller's evasively moderate positions.  The question the primary will answer today is how Goldwater's stands appeal to the people of New Hampshire.</span></p>"}

I get the impression that the land is cursed and suffering, groaning under the awful weight of history's sins.  I can understand what Faulkner meant:  it must be loved or hated...or both.  It's hard to imagine how any music but the blues could have taken root in the black soil around me.</b></span></p> <p><span>From Greenwood down to Jackson...My first real taste of the Mississippi sun dropping westward ever so slowly and flaying the cotton-frothed, billiard table flatness of the Delta.  Stilted shacks in willow-ringed hollows; tall merciless lilywhite factory stacks; \"The Knights of the Ku Klux Klan Welcome you to Tchula;\" grinning, barefoot, ragged black boys skimming along the highway on a pickup truck; Tall, gaunt, stooped, tobacco chewing, strawhatted farmers--black and white.  Neat brick middle-class American homes...Troopers and policemen everywhere, fat comic opera sherrifs in stenciled boots and stetsons.  \"K.O. the Kennedys!--Vote Rubel Phillips (Rep)\" billboards, \"Maintain White Democratic Solidarity--Vote Paul Johnson (Dem)\" billboards, Kiwanis!  Rotary!  Order of the Eastern Star!  White Citizens Council!</span></p> <p><span>...The waitress in Birmingham called out the colored cook to wait on us.  The waitress in Anniston let us wait through the fifteen minute rest stop.  The waitress in Columbus, Miss. spilled cream all over my brand new overalls.  We expected a good whipping or at least a week in jail in war-like Winona, Miss., but they had replaced the cafeteria with vending machines.  An ancient, bespectacled colonel offered me a quarter for my front seat as we approached Winona.  I declined and he returned to the back of the bus. \u00a0\u00a0<b>Jackson, Miss.</b> \u00a0\u00a0<b>Nov. 20, 1963</b></span></p> <p><span>At the end of the Freedom vote campaign I drove up to Jackson with one of the Yale volunteers...Hanging around the office and acting as a field worker at large I ran into J--a 25 year old cat from Miami.  We talked about a Community Center program that he was in the process of designing, and the idea excited me.  The voter registration program, you see, is not getting anybody registered...even in cases where there is no discrimination evident, the poll tax and literacy test are far too effective obstacles to get anything dramatic done..  We are just beginning to check the shell of submissiveness that this damned police state has built up over the past few centuries and the enemy is just getting sophisticated enough to use his economic control of the state to good advantage--not <i>too</i> sophisticated, though; there's a prowl car parked outside the office right now.</span></p> <p><span>If what we're trying to do is get the people solidly behind our program (and a moderate program it is--even if radical by Mississippi standards) then we will have to find some better basis of appealing to them than squatting in a town for a few months shouting about the rights of man...This thing will die a young death unless we can involve the masses, and we aren't involving them fast enough or on a permanent enough basis.  The Community Center project will supply all the hard-core little racist towns in the Delta with local centers for continued action.  We'll attract people on the basis of felt bread-and-butter needs, let them ally themselves personally with the Movement and feel a real part of it...We're going to call for an awful lot of northern student volunteers down here this summer...</span></p> <p><span>This is a pretty depressing state, and I've had a close look at some of its most depressing parts in the last couple of weeks.  J--and myself were set afoot on highway 49 last week when a gun-waving state cop arrested everybody in our party with a Mississippi license and impounded our car.  We later heard that he had some local yahoos out looking for us, but we walked the twenty miles from Yazoo City to Flora in the ditches along the roadside.  Yazoo City is a bad problem; we managed to get a lady run out of town just for serving us in her (Negro) cafe, and a man beaten just for talking to us.  We've gone in there four times, canvassing for freedom votes--we've had three arrests, an eviction, and two beatings.  It's a very weird feeling to walk along a street with a billy-swinging S.S. man three feet behind you--muttering sincere threats.</span></p> <p><span>J--, myself, and a Vassar girl named C-- drove up to Canton this morning to look the place over.  We were looking for a town that was classically Mississippian enough to be the site of the first Community Center.  Canton is so classically Mississippian that I can't stand it--cotton and ancient shacks and barefooted (there was a cold drizzle, and the streets were unpaved and muddy) black children.  A city cop stopped us, noticing that we had out-of county tags (talk about provincialism), and informed us that we had better not be bringing \"any of that freedom crap\" in there.</span></p> <p><span>* * * \u00a0\u00a0<b>Canton, Mississippi</b> \u00a0\u00a0<b>January 21, 1964</b></span></p> <p><span>The colored men's cage at the Hinds County Jail consists of a hundred-foot corridor with five eight-man cells on either side.  Everything except the floor is made of unpainted blue steel--the floor is of ancient cracked cement.  Each cell is eighteen feet wide by eleven feet deep with two barred and screened windows.  There is a hole in the floor of each cell which serves as a toilet--it is flushed periodically by trusties who happen by.  There is a needle-spray cold water shower in the large day room (in which the prisoners are locked from 6:00 a.m. to 6 p.m.)--along with two steel table bench combinations.  No radios allowed, no sleeping in the day room.</span></p> <p><span>Prisoners are fed at six and six.  The morning meal consists of three cold biscuits.  The whites are served first, (theirs may be warm--I don't know), a strip of \"streak-o'-lean\" bacon, and a tablespoon of cane syrup.  Supper is one slab of cornbread (cold again), rice, and red beans.  Prisoners are given a mattress and a blanket upon arrival, to be returned upon release.  No uniforms are issued and neither are packages of fresh clothing permitted in...</span></p> <p><span>The sheriff's deputy is a pointedly jolly individual, known to joke and giggle while in the process of beating a prisoner with his five-pound strap or shoving him into the tiny black steam-heated solitary 'hotbox' cell.  The only thing which seems to upset his routine of chuckling brutality is the presence of \"Freedom Riders\" (He manages to make it sound like an obscenity).  He doesn't like me.</span></p> <p><span>When we were being transported from the city to the county jail (handcuffed, escorted by nervous shotguns), the deputy, having heard that we were coming, came downstairs to meet us.  He is supposed to fill out an information blank on each prisoner, so there is a brief interrogation session before one is run up to the fifth floor cages.  \"Youah name Weavuh, dat raht?\"  Without thinking, I replied, \"That's right.\"  He leaped across the table and beat me out of the room and halfway down the hall.  I finally went limp and fell to the floor, hoping that he would think that I was seriously hurt and slack off--he began kicking me in the ribs and I hurriedly considered the practicality of nonviolence in this situation.  He grabbed me by my shirtfront--ripping it and straining himself--and dragged me back into the interrogation room (there I noticed that the police escort had drawn guns on the other dozen or so prisoners and everyone seemed quite nervous).  All this time the deputy had kept up a high pitch shout of \"<i>Yassuh,</i> you sonovabitch!  <i>Yassuh,</i> you black bastard!  Say <i>YASSUH!\"</i>  Now he reached into his desk drawer and I perceived that pronouncing two syllables could save me a pistol whipping.  The hell with it, I thought--\"Yes <i>sir.\"</i>  He stood there breathing heavily and looking down for a good minute... \"Get away from here.\"</span></p> <p><span>Some of my teeth were loosened, and my ears are still ringing.  My pride and my head were sore for days, but at least I was able to stay out of the infirmary (rumor has it to be worse than the jail itself).</span></p> <p><span>Byron De La Beckwith (remember him?) was in a private cell right below us, and the trusties said that his meals were sent up to him by a local group of white ladies that he had sheets--changed every week--and that the deputies brought him a newspaper every day.</span></p> <p><span>Things are happening quickly in Canton now.  The selective buying campaign has thrown the downtown merchants and the police into a panic...they seem even more confused than we are.  The s.b. campaign ... is damn near one hundred per cent effective, and the town is in a real hurt.  Police cruisers have started following us everywhere we go.  We have to stop hitching rides, since anyone who picks us up can be sure of getting a ticket and a stiff fine.  We have no car.  Repairs have not yet begun on the community center building, but we have at last found a Negro contractor who is not afraid to take the job.</span></p> <p><span>Charles Evers came up to speak at the mass meeting last night, and the Madison County Movement was officially organized.  Firetrucks kept passing the church with sirens full on, and the crowd laughed, as other crowds have laughed, at the old saw--There's a fire burning in here that they can't put out!\"  I took the guitar and taught them a few freedom songs --meetings should get more spirited as we go along; we're having them every Monday ...</span></p> <p><span>Others are begining to step forward now:  Mrs. D--, J--, T--, M--, G--, (C-- has just come in to tell me that G-- was arrested this morning for burning trash on the sidewalk and got out on $250 bond ... L-- lost his city job because he visited the Freedom House too often.  Things are getting rough).</span></p> <p><span>Merchants have been calling and dropping by all week to beg forgiveness ... A Mr. B-- got up and begged in front of last week's mass meeting.  He took up nearly an hour with the heart-rending story of his long-time underground friendship for the good colored people of Canton.  The committee has decided to keep the squeeze on all of them for a while--to impress them with the latent power of the Negro community ...  All of their efforts at retaliation so far have been clumsy and amateurish, but the state legislature has just passed a bill making it easy for \"municipalities to cooperate in the suppression of riots and civil disturbances.\"  We may well have to contend with the Yazoo City police and the Jackson police as well as the local incompetents.

These people are now located principally in congested urban areas and in the rural Appalachian Plateau running from eastern Pennsylvania to Alabama.</span></p> <p><span>To solve the problems of poverty in these areas, it will be necessary to see that children there get the best possible education.  The federal government must provide special schools and a corps of highly paid good teachers to bring educational standards there up to those of the most affluent suburbs, Galbraith said.  Such projects cannot be financed locally because sufficient funds do not exist where they are needed most.</span></p> <p><span>In addition to education, federal aid to depressed areas should include slum clearance and public housing, a stronger mental health program, and assistance in vocational training and retraining, Galbraith said.  Once people are healthy, educated, and skilled; work can be found for them in the expanding economy, or in the exploitation of natural resources in the areas in which they live, he maintained.</span></p>"}

Labor Secretary W.

The <i>Times</i> must have meant either that the test-takers \"blew smoke upon\" the test (a usage common in 1699) or that they \"scared\" it.  Of these meanings the first seems the more probable, even though the early usage commonly conveyed the meaning \"to blow smoke upon (a person).\"  Words change over the centuries and no doubt it is now possible to funk an inanamiate object.  Other meanings of funk (from the Latin, <i>fumigare</i>) are \"to smoke (a pipe) 1704,\" and hence, \"to cause an offensive smell.\"  We have also the noun meaning \"a strong smell or stink.\"</span></p> <p><span>If the <i>Times</i> used slang, we might believe that the young men of America were \"trying to shirk or evade\" these mental tests.  Other slang definitions will cast light on this matter of national concern; for example, funk, \"a state of panic,\" \"first listed as Oxford slang.\"  The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary is uncertain.  See BLUE, they suggest.  But before we do, notice a term in which \"funk\" is used in combination:  Funkhole, military slang, \"a trench dug-out; employment used as a pretext for evading military service.\"  Here we have another connection which the <i>Times</i> surely, must have had in mind.</span></p> <p><span>Now for BLUE.

{"title": "A Man for No Reasons | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The average delegate to an American political convention has a remarkable chameleon-like quality which allows him to turn back from a back-stabbing wheeler dealer into a docile party regular in about as much time as it takes to say \"William Scranton.\"  The Republican convention will commence in San Francisco in mid-July and a roseterous imbroglio, even by Democratic Party standards, appears imminent.</span></p> <p><span>But after a few days the combatants will grow nervous as their interaccins squabbles are aired before millions of fascinated television viewers.  Someone, perhaps General (and former President) Eisenhowever, may say \"William Scranton\" (say it soft and it's almost like praying).  The sounds of battle will cease.  Knives will be cleaned and resheathed.  Men of good will, weary now, will link arms in brotherhood and the faithful will chorus \"William Scranton.\"  Then they will cry together \"Mark Hatfield,\" and the only man ever to campaign for the vice-presidential nomination for nine years will assume second place on the ticket.</span></p> <p><span>Why Scranton?  He served one term in the House (voting for such liberal projects as the enlargement of the Rules Committee) before winning election in 1962 as Governor of Pennsylvania.  His record is Harrisburg has been at best unspectacular, although not nearly as disastrous as George Romany's in Michigan.  He is a handsome man, young (46) and vigorous and perpetrator of the Republicans' greatest electoral victory in 1962.  He has an Ivy League education (Hotchkies and Yale '39), a pretty wife, a prettier teen-age daughter, three young sons, and, according to the <i>New York Times,</i> a subscription to <i>Foreign Affairs Quarterly</i>.</span></p> <p><span>Scranton's unrelieved blandness is precisely the point.  He will be nominated by the Republicans not so much for what he has done, but for what he hasn't.  He has never been divorced and remarried, although he has a whole city named for his family, not merely a Center.  He has never taken as extremist position on anything, except perhaps the Harvard-Yale game, and is thus eminently acceptable to the Eastern, Internationalist, bigmoney wing of the party.</span></p> <p><span>Unlike Romney, Scranton has not failed to put over a workable fiscal program in a chronically bankrupt state.  Nor has he provoked the wrath of his own party, as Ronney did, after hinting he might accept a draft for the nomination.</span></p> <p><span>Although Goldwater and Rockfeller are the only two announced candidates, the well-publicized objections to both, will most likely be decisive in their downfalls.  At this point the two contenders with the best chance of defeating Scranton are those who can make use of the experience issue, Nixon and Lodge.</span></p> <p><span><i>The Christian Science Monitor</i> reported last week that Nixon's irrepressible competitive spirit is forcing him closer and closer to declaring his availability.  This is hardly a surprise, especially since President Kennedy's death has enhanced the chances of a northern moderate to win both the Republican nomination and the election.  The <i>Monitor</i> also offered the somewhat dubious reason that Nixon would be the only other candidate acceptable to the Goldwater forces, those diminished but still significant legions of the sun.</span></p> <p><span>But Scranton has never lost a Presidential election, nor has he run for Governor of California and been defeated by Pat Brown.  And he has never been tasteless enough to vent in public whatever paranoic feelings he might harbor about the press or his dog.</span></p> <p><span>Lodge's candidacy is almost entirely the result of General Eisenhower's recent statement urging him to run.  If he happens to win it would not at all be inappropriate for his campaign posters to read \"I got my job through the New York <i>Times.\"</i>  Lodge thus far has been adamant in his resistance, and his presence in Saigon, so far from the battle, will not help his backers build an organization.  Although he is well-known he has a good measure of Scranton-like purity.  If foreign affairs appear extremely important in July, Lodge could win the nomination because of his experience, if not his overwhelming success in that realm.</span></p> <p><span>Scranton however, has never been deposed from a Senate seat by a brash young Congressman named Kennedy, nor has he run for vice-President and lost.  His greatest asset is that he has not done very much of anything, and rival partisans, therefore, have precious little to hold against him.</span></p>"}

You know that he is a politician the instant he shakes your hand, and asks where you come from and how you spell your name.</span></p> <p><span>Governor Brown visited Cambridge yesterday, actively campaigning to avoid the Democratic vice-presidential nomination.  The Governor was interviewed as he cruised through the city in a huge Cadillac limousine.  The conversation went like this:</span></p> <p><span>Reporter:  Governor Brown, I would like to ask you a few questions about your feelings regarding the Vice-Presid. . .</span></p> <p><span>Brown:  So you're from New York.  Do you get out to California much?</span></p> <p><span>Reporter:  No, I haven't been there.  Sir, several of the top news magazines in the country regard you as the strongest candidate. . .</span></p> <p><span>Brown:  Well, if you get out to California sometime, uh. . .let me know.  My youngest daughter Kathleen, is a sophomore at Stanford University this year. . .  Do you like Harvard?</span></p> <p><span>Governor Brown was having fun.  Only when the reporter gave up his attempts at interviewing did the Governor begin to talk politics.  He talks politics with an case and, considering his delicate position in the non-race for the Vice-Presidency, a frankness which is truly disarming.</span></p> <p><span>Governor Brown considers former Vice-President Richard M. Nixon the most popular candidate right now for the Republican presidential nomination.  He has tremendous grass roots support,\" the Governor said.  \"Of course he must be very careful to avoid any overt acts of campaigning for the nomination!  His operation must be entirely undercover.  But he's used to that--undercover is the way he's always operated.\"</span></p> <p><span>The Governor hooked his left hand under the belt of his pants.  It seems to be a characteristic gesture, but he has to suck his breath in hard to accomplish it:  the former 100-pound high school basketball player occasionally seems to forget that he now carries a portly 185 pounds.  What did he think of Pennsylvania Gov. William G. Scranton's chances?  Scranton, he agreed, is the man to beat.  \"He has all the party professionals behind him, and while Nixon has grass-roots following, he can't convince the pros.\"  Governor Brown said that Goldwater was badly hurt, in California as well as the South, by President Kennedy's death.  Rockefeller, he suspects, does not have much chance.</span></p> <p><span>Just then the Cadillac pulled up outside the Center for Urban Studies, one of the Governor's scheduled stops.  He asked his aide where he was and what he was doing there as he got out of the limousine.  The aide mumbled a few words to him as they walked up the stairs to the a few words to him as they walked up the stairs to the Center.  Governor Brown was introduced to the directors of the project and was soon seated in a small office for a discussion with them.  \"I'm very interested in urban affairs--as you know, it's a big problem in California--and so I thought it appropriate while I was in Cambridge to stop at the Center and see if you could give me any advice.\"</span></p> <p><span>Governor Brown listened to the advice punctuating the conversation with expressions of interest:  \"Oh, are ya?  . . .  How do you think it's going?  . . .  Do you really . . .\"  The fact is that he <i>was</i> interested in the conversation.  The extraordinary thing about the Governor is that political mannerisms are not a pose for him, but an integral part of his personality.  This gives him limits as well as assets:  it makes him a bland figure, despite his sometimes courageous political positions.  He seems almost incapable of offending anyone.</span></p> <p><span>But Governor Brown is sincerely interested in people and their activities.  He has an instinct for pleasing people even when they realize he is trying to please them.  After the time allotted for the visit, the Governor's aide stood up and wordlessly began putting on his coat.  \"Oh, is it time to leave?\"  Governor Brown sounded truly disappointed.  It was difficult to decide whether the aide's getting up so that the Governor appeared to linger was a gimmick or not.</span></p> <p><span>In the limousine on his way to lunch, the Governor talked about the Vice-Presidential nomination.  When the reporter suggested that it was not as exciting a job as being governor of the most populous state in the Union, Brown agreed that he was happy with what he was doing.  But, he addled, if Johnson had refused the nomination in 1960, Dick Nixon would have won.  That is a frightening thought to Governor Brown.</span></p> <p><span>\"You can't go after the vice-presidential nomination,\" Governor Brown said.  \"It would be embarrassing to President Johnson, and as far as I am concerned getting him re-elected is the most important thing.\"  He tucked his hand under his belt again.  \"I'm pretty sure the President won't make a selection until after the Republican convention is over.\"  He discounted Tuesday's trial balloon from the White House about Sargent Shriver for the post as a trial balloon.  The President will fly a few more before this thing is over,\" he said.</span></p>"}

However, as Johnson predicted, the principal effect of the programs should be to provide medical and psychiatric treatment for those who cannot afford such services.  The Army has long offered the only successful mass job training program in the country; it could now very well serve another social function by facilitating a necessary health program, which would be immune to charges of socialism.  The failure of nearly half the men examined last year to qualify for the Army testifies to the need for this program.</span></p> <p><span>But early registration is only a small step towards a sensible draft policy.  While the Pentagon study may suggest further measures, it is necessary to evaluate the draft from more than the military prospective.  It is improbable that military duty is the most fruitful way for all young men to fulfill their obligation.  The Peace Corps and the proposed National Service Corps are two alternatives which would appeal to many young men and provide a more useful outlet for their talents.  Since the armed forces now require only a third of the men in the manpower pool every year, the President should direct his affection not only to improving the Selective Service lottery but also to making a more rational allocation of manpower.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Pat Brown Talks Here; Scores Sen. Goldwater | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>California's Governor Edmund G. (Pat) Brown made a quick stop in Cambridge yesterday, giving Harvard a taste of both his political and his academic personalities.  Brown, who has been mentioned as a possible candidate for the Democratic vice-presidential nomination, moved from a denunciation of Barry Goldwater and an analysis of Democratic politics to a discussion of the state's role in a federal system of government--all in the space of a short afternoon.</span></p> <p><span>Speaking early in the day to a gathering of the Young Democrats, Brown labelled some of Senator Goldwater's proposals as \"bordering on the ridiculous\" and said \"it worries me that this man might become President.\"  He did not think, however, that either Goldwater or Nelson Rockefeller would win the Republican nomination, but that Pennsylvania's Governor William Scranton had a \"good chance.\"</span></p> <p><span>Later in the afternoon, Brown spoke to a receptive audience of about 250 in Littauer Auditorium.  He made some \"urgent\" proposals for bringing America's federalism up to date.  He called especially for the formation of a Council of Governors, similar to the Economic Council of Advisers to the President, which would advise the national government \"before policy is made, not after.\"</span></p> <p><span>A state governor, Brown said, is \"the people's advocate\" in a way that Congressmen are not, for he is constantly in touch with all the problems a state must face.  Yet a governor cannot, Brown added, have a direct effect on the formation of national policy, but can only speak through intermediaries.</span></p> <p><span>Brown said that a much closer relationship between the national and state governments is needed.  \"There is a limit to what even a prosperous and growing state like California can undertake by itself.\"  The national government, Brown said, must undertake programs to alleviate national problems--poverty, unemployment, racial discrimination--which no state has the resources to solve.  \"California could wipe out its personal income tax altogether,\" he said, \"and it would have less than one-third of the impact of a small cut in federal taxes.\"</span></p> <p><span>Brown also urged the creation of more inter-state programs, like TVA, to deal with problems above the state level.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Justice and Oswald | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The American public, through the nation's press, television, and radio, has been persuaded that Lee Harvey Oswald assassinated President Kennedy.  A presumption of guilt, rather than of innocence, has dominated the news media; the day after Ruby shot Oswald, the New York <i>Times</i> headlined its front page, \"President's Assassin Shot to Death.\"  In the 55 days since Kennedy's murder, only a few publications, notably the <i>New Republic,</i> the <i>Reporter,</i> and the <i>National Guardian,</i> have pointed out the weakness of the evidence which has been presented to the public.</span></p> <p><span>Foreign public opinion remains, for the most part, unconvinced by the U.S. press.  The socialist bloc is not alone in its conviction that Oswald was framed.  The <i>Messenger,</i> a moderate Greek newsweekly, wrote, \"It is obvious...that they [the Dallas police] <i>manufactured</i> methodically the evidence against Oswald, and that they helped Ruby in his deed, so that Oswald's voice would never be heard.\"</span></p> <p><span>In the U.S., conservative forces have already begun to use America's belief in Oswald's guilt to show that they are correct in opposing \"communists.\"  The John Birch Society has declared.  \"We believe that the president of the United States has been murdered by a Communist within the United States.\"  Senator Goldwater, in a campaign speech, said that Kennedy's assassin had \"a mind fed by communism.\"  Abroad, the summary dispatch with which the Oswald case was closed, the fabrication of evidence by the Dallas police, and the killing of Oswald, have led many to suspect an elaborate rightist plot in the United States.</span></p> <p><span>For the sake of a rational political atmosphere at home and for the sake of America's Image in the world, Americans should want to know the truth about Kennedy's assassination.  They should wonder:  if Oswald may be innocent, then who else may be guilty?  But above all, they should feel compelled to find the facts, because in the United States no man is considered guilty until convicted under law.</span></p> <p><span>President Johnson is to be congratulated on his appointment of a special committee, headed by Chief Justice Earl Warren, \"to satisfy itself that the truth is known as far as it can be discovered.\"  The committee itself is to be congratulated for the deliberation and the discretion with which it is conducting the investigation.</span></p> <p><span>But the Warren committee is severely hampered by the nation's verdict on Oswald.  Those with an investment in seeing Oswald proved guilty are strengthened by the present public certainty of his guilt.  Already their influence is felt; in a six point outline of the committee's work, given by the committee's counsel, J. Lee Rankin, four points concerned Oswald, but none even touched upon the idea that other persons may have committed the crime.</span></p> <p><span>Only by answering all the questions about the shootings of Kennedy and Oswald, in the fullest and most public manner possible, can the Warren committee serve justice.  The committee's job will be easier if the public ceases to prejudge the case.</span></p> <p><span>Americans should realize that the published evidence against Oswald proves nothing.  They must look to the Warren committee for the real answers, whether it concludes that Oswald is innocent, guilty, or concludes that there can be no conclusions.</span></p>"}
{"title": "George Romney | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>\"I was afraid you weren't going to ask me that,\" replied Governor George Romney to the inevitable question at the Washington dinner he was addressing.  Romney may have been half-joking, but only half:  his Presidential stock has gone down considerably in the past year.  Only last spring his name was invariably mentioned after Rockefeller and Goldwater and before Scranton; now he has difficulty making the Top Five.</span></p> <p><span>Romney's main liability is that he hasn't made a roaring success of being Michigan's first Republican governor in fifteen years.  Most of his proposals failed to get through the Legislature, where they were opposed both by Democrats and by the outstate, ultra-conservative Republicans who have dominated both houses.  Michigan, which Republicans often call labor-dominated, still does not have a minimum wage law, although Romney has again promised one for this year.  Romney's one attempt to assert state over federal power ended when the state Attorney-General, a Democrat, ruled it unconstitutional; thus the state takes no advantage of federal aid to dependent children of the unemployed.</span></p> <p><span>Romney's Presidential stock feel fastest, however, when the Legislature rejected his tax program.  The governor had proposed an income tax, lower corporation taxes, and the removal of the four per cent sales tax on food and drugs--virtually the same program his predecessor, John B. Swainson, had advanced a year before.  If anything, Romney had worse luck than Swainson in the Legislature.  At one point, Swainson had a majority of the state Senate supporting his bill, when suddenly six moderate Republicans decided at once that each of the other five was going to change his vote, and the bill was defeated.  Romney never even got this kind of majority.  He ended up gaining few votes from either Democrats or outstate Republicans, and his tax program was defeated.</span></p> <p><span>Romney still retains some of the charisma that shone on the cover of <i>Time</i> magazine in his more cocksure days; he runs ahead of Governor Scranton, for instance, in a poll of Republican rank-and-file.  However, he has never actively sought the Party's Presidential nomination for 1964, and he has no large organization working for him.  Besides, party professionals, who now place him far down the list, have never liked him much anyhow; it is said that they feel he is too independent.  But this does not explain much, for while he is certainly not allied with the leaders of the Michigan Republican Party--who are largely outstate legislators--he might fit nicely into the national G.O.P. picture.</span></p> <p><span>What is probably more objectionable to professional politicians is his lack of vote-getting ability, Admittedly, Romney is Michigan's first Republican governor since \"Soapy\" Williams won the first of his six terms in 1948.  But Michigan has given Democrats other than Williams consistent majorities only since 1954, and their pluralities have seldom been large--again Williams is the exception.  In this light, Romney's victory over Swainson by 80,000 votes in 1962 pales beside Scranton's 480,000 margin and Rockefeller's 520,000.</span></p> <p><span>Romney's ability to win votes seems to have declined since November, 1962.  The new state constitution, which was largely his work, passed a state-wide referendum by only seven thousand votes out of two million cast; the Democrats, who opposed the document, might have won the election if they had not overestimated Romney's strength and spent very little time and money on it.</span></p> <p><span>The failure of Romney's tax program probably cost him more votes.  A poll taken for ex-Governor Swainson surprisingly showed Swainson ahead of Romney, 50.1 per cent to 49.5 in the gubernatorial contest.  Swainson, however, has ruled himself out of November's race for reasons of health, and the likely winner of the Democratic nomination is Neil Staebler, now Congressman-at-Large and the Democratic State Chairman who presided over Williams's victories.  Staebler won his '62 race--his first--by 110,000 votes, and although he is not as well-known as Swainson, he does not have the close identification with labor unions that hurt Swainson in many voters' eyes.</span></p> <p><span>It appears that Romney should have little trouble in evading the Republican Presidential nomination; his greatest difficulty in 1964 will be getting re-elected Governor of Michigan.</span></p>"}
